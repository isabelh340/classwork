   Volumes of the United States Reports on the shelf at a law library

   The United States Reports are the official record (law reports) of the
   rulings, orders, case tables (list of every case decided, in
   alphabetical order both by the name of the petitioner (plaintiff in
   lower courts) and by the name of the respondent (defendant)), and other
   proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States. Opinions of the
   court in each case, prepended with a headnote prepared by the Reporter
   of Decisions, and any concurring or dissenting opinions are published
   sequentially. The Court's Publication Office oversees the binding and
   publication of the volumes of United States Reports, although the
   actual printing, binding, and publication are performed by private
   firms under contract with the United States Government Printing Office.
   The latest published United States Reports as of January 2013 was
   volume 554, ISBN 9780160910296, published in 2012.

Citation[edit]

   For lawyers, citations to United States Reports are the standard
   reference for Supreme Court decisions. Under the commonly accepted
   citation protocol, the case Brown, et al., v. Board of Education of
   Topeka, Kansas, for example, is cited thus:

          Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954).

   This citation indicates that the decision of the Court in the case
   entitled Brown v. Board of Education (as properly abbreviated per the
   aforementioned citation protocol), decided in 1954, can be found
   beginning at page 483 of volume 347 of the United States Reports.

History[edit]

   The early volumes of the United States Reports were originally
   published privately by the individual Supreme Court Reporters. As was
   the practice in England, the reports were designated by the names of
   the reporters who compiled them: Dallas's Reports, Cranch's Reports,
   etc.

   The decisions appearing in the entire first volume and most of the
   second volume of United States Reports are not decisions of the United
   States Supreme Court. Instead, they are decisions from various
   Pennsylvania courts, dating from the colonial period and the first
   decade after Independence. Alexander Dallas, a lawyer and journalist,
   of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had been in the business of reporting
   these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began
   compiling his case reports in a bound volume, which he called Reports
   of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and
   since the Revolution.^[1] This would come to be known as the first
   volume of Dallas Reports.

   When the United States Supreme Court, along with the rest of the new
   Federal Government, moved in 1791 from New York City to the nation’s
   temporary capital, in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme
   Court’s first unofficial and unpaid Supreme Court Reporter. (Court
   reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit
   from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas
   continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second
   volume of his Reports; and, when the Supreme Court began hearing cases,
   he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the
   second volume, 2 Dallas Reports, with West v. Barnes (1791). Dallas
   went on to publish a total of four volumes of decisions during his
   tenure as Reporter.

   When the Supreme Court moved to Washington, D.C., in 1800, Dallas
   remained in Philadelphia, and William Cranch took over as unofficial
   reporter of decisions. In 1817 Congress made the Reporter of Decisions
   an official, salaried position,^[2] although the publication of the
   Reports remained a private enterprise for the reporter's personal gain.
   The reports themselves were the subject of an early copyright case,
   Wheaton v. Peters, in which former reporter Henry Wheaton sued then
   current reporter Richard Peters for reprinting cases from Wheaton's
   Reports in abridged form.

   In 1874, the U.S. government began to fund the reports' publication,
   creating the United States Reports. The earlier, private reports were
   retroactively numbered volumes 1–90 of the United States Reports,
   starting from the first volume of Dallas Reports.^[3] Therefore,
   decisions appearing in these early reports have dual citation forms:
   one for the volume number of the United States Reports, and one for the
   set of nominate reports. For example, the complete citation to
   McCulloch v. Maryland is 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819).
