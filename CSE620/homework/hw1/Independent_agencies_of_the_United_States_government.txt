Independent agencies of the United States government

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   Independent agencies of the United States federal government are those
   agencies that exist outside of the federal executive departments (those
   headed by a Cabinet secretary). More specifically, the term may be used
   to describe agencies that, while constitutionally part of the executive
   branch, are independent of presidential control, usually because the
   president's power to dismiss the agency head or a member is limited.

   Established through separate statutes passed by the Congress, each
   respective statutory grant of authority defines the goals the agency
   must work towards, as well as what substantive areas, if any, over
   which it may have the power of rulemaking. These agency rules (or
   regulations), when in force, have the power of federal law.

Functional characteristics[edit]

   Independent agencies can be distinguished from the federal executive
   departments and other executive agencies by their structural and
   functional characteristics.^[1] Congress can also designate certain
   agencies explicitly as "independent" in the governing statute, but the
   functional differences have more legal significance.^[2]

   While most executive agencies have a single director, administrator, or
   secretary appointed by the President of the United States, independent
   agencies (in the narrower sense of being outside presidential control)
   almost always have a commission, board, or similar collegial body
   consisting of five to seven members who share power over the
   agency.^[1] (This is why many independent agencies include the word
   "Commission" or "Board" in their name.) The President appoints the
   commissioners or board members, subject to Senate confirmation, but
   they often serve with staggered terms, and often for longer terms than
   a usual four-year Presidential term,^[3] meaning most Presidents will
   not have the opportunity to appoint all the commissioners of a given
   independent agency. Normally the President can designate which
   Commissioner will serve as the Chairperson.^[3] Normally there are
   statutory provisions limiting the President's authority to remove
   commissioners, typically for incapacity, neglect of duty, malfeasance,
   or other good cause.^[4] In addition, most independent agencies have a
   statutory requirement of bipartisan membership on the commission, so
   the President cannot simply fill vacancies with members of his own
   political party.^[3]

   In reality, the high turnover rate among these commissioners or board
   members means that most Presidents have the opportunity to fill enough
   vacancies to constitute a voting majority on each independent agency
   commission within the first two years of the first term as
   President.^[5] In some famous instances, Presidents have found the
   independent agencies more loyal and in lockstep with the President's
   wishes and policy objectives than some dissenters among the executive
   agency political appointments.^[6] Presidential attempts to remove
   independent agency officials have generated most of the important
   Supreme Court legal opinions in this area.^[3] Presidents normally do
   have the authority to remove heads of independent agencies, but they
   must meet the statutory requirements for removal, such as demonstrating
   that the individual has committed malfeasance. In contrast, the
   President can remove regular executive agency heads at will.

   If the independent agency exercises any executive powers like
   enforcement, and most of them do, Congress cannot participate in the
   regular removal process of commissioners.^[7] Constitutionally,
   Congress can only participate directly in impeachment proceedings.
   Congress can, however, pass statutes limiting the circumstances under
   which the President can remove commissioners of independent
   agencies.^[8] Members of Congress cannot serve as commissioners on
   independent agencies that have executive powers,^[9] nor can Congress
   itself appoint the commissioners - the Appointments Clause of the
   Constitution vests that power in the President.^[10] The Senate does
   participate, however, in appointments through "advice and consent",
   which occurs through confirmation hearings and votes on the President's
   nominees.

Independent regulatory agency[edit]

   There is a further distinction between an independent agency and an
   independent regulatory agency. The Paperwork Reduction Act lists 19
   enumerated "independent regulatory agencies". Generally, the heads of
   independent regulatory agencies can only be removed for cause, whereas
   independent agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and
   Cabinet department heads serve "at the pleasure of the President".^[11]
   Executive Order 12866, which requires cost-benefit analysis for certain
   regulatory actions, does not apply to independent regulatory
   agencies.^[11]

Examples[edit]

     * The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gathers intelligence and
       provides national security assessments to policymakers in the
       United States. It acts as the primary human intelligence provider
       for the federal government.

     * The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates commodity
       futures and option markets in the United States. The agency
       protects market participants against manipulation, abusive trade
       practices and fraud. Through effective oversight and regulation,
       the CFTC enables the markets to serve better their important
       functions in the nation's economy providing a mechanism for price
       discovery and a means of offsetting price risk.

     * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with state and
       local governments throughout the United States to control and abate
       pollution in the air and water and to deal with problems related to
       solid waste, pesticides, radiation, and toxic substances. EPA sets
       and enforces standards for air and water quality, evaluates the
       impact of pesticides and chemical substances, and manages the
       "Superfund" program for cleaning toxic waste sites.

     * The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is charged with
       regulating interstate and international communications by radio,
       television, wire, satellite, and cable. It licenses radio and
       television broadcast stations, assigns radio frequencies, and
       enforces regulations designed to ensure that cable rates are
       reasonable. The FCC regulates common carriers, such as telephone
       and telegraph companies, as well as wireless telecommunications
       service providers.

     * The Federal Election Commission (FEC) oversees campaign financing
       for all federal elections. The Commission oversees election rules
       as well as reporting of campaign contributions by the candidates.

     * The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is the United
       States federal agency with jurisdiction over interstate electricity
       sales, wholesale electric rates, hydroelectric licensing, natural
       gas pricing, and oil pipeline rates. FERC also reviews and
       authorizes liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, interstate
       natural gas pipelines and non-federal hydropower projects.

     * The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) regulates the international
       ocean transportation of the United States. It is charged with
       ensuring a competitive, efficient, and economic ocean
       transportation system.^[12]

     * The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the
       governing body of the Federal Reserve System (frequently referred
       to as "the Fed"^[13]), the central bank of the United States. It
       conducts the nation's monetary policy by influencing the volume of
       credit and money in circulation. The Federal Reserve regulates
       private banking institutions, works to contain systemic risk in
       financial markets, and provides certain financial services to the
       U.S. government, the public, and financial institutions.

     * The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is one of
       the smaller Executive Branch agencies, with just over 100
       employees. It was established to administer the Thrift Savings Plan
       (TSP), which provides Federal employees the opportunity to save for
       additional retirement security. The Thrift Savings Plan is a
       tax-deferred defined contribution plan similar to a private sector
       401(k) plan.

     * The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces federal antitrust and
       consumer protection laws by investigating complaints against
       individual companies initiated by consumers, businesses,
       congressional inquiries, or reports in the media. The commission
       seeks to ensure that the nation's markets function competitively by
       eliminating unfair or deceptive practices.

     * The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for the
       purchase, supply, operation, and maintenance of federal property,
       buildings, and equipment, and for the sale of surplus items. GSA
       also manages the federal motor vehicle fleet and oversees
       telecommuting centers and civilian child care centers.

     * The International Trade Commission (ITC) provides trade expertise
       to both the legislative and executive branches of government,
       determines the impact of imports on U.S. industries, and directs
       actions against certain unfair trade practices, such as patent,
       trademark, and copyright infringement.

     * The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was
       established in 1958 to run the American space program. It placed
       the first American satellites and astronauts in orbit, and it
       launched the Apollo spacecraft that landed men on the moon in 1969.
       Today, NASA conducts research aboard earth-orbiting satellites and
       interplanetary probes, explores new concepts in advanced aerospace
       technology, and operates the U.S. fleet of manned space shuttle
       orbiters.

     * The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves
       the nation's history by overseeing the management of all federal
       records. The holdings of the National Archives include original
       textual materials, motion picture films, sound and video
       recordings, maps, still pictures, and computer data. The
       Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of
       Rights are preserved and displayed at the National Archives
       building in Washington, D.C.

     * The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administers the principal
       United States labor law, the National Labor Relations Act. The
       board is vested with the power to prevent or remedy unfair labor
       practices and to safeguard employees' rights to organize and
       determine through elections whether to have a union as their
       bargaining representative.

     * The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates all
       aviation accidents in the United States, and certain major railroad
       and other accidents.^[14]

     * The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was established by the
       Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 from the United States Atomic
       Energy Commission, and was first opened January 19, 1975. The NRC
       oversees reactor safety and security, reactor licensing and
       renewal, radioactive material safety, and spent fuel management
       (storage, security, recycling, and disposal).

     * The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a United States government
       agency that supports fundamental research and education in all the
       non-medical fields of science and engineering.

     * The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was established to
       protect investors who buy stocks and bonds. Federal laws require
       companies that plan to raise money by selling their own securities
       to file reports about their operations with the SEC, so that
       investors have access to all material information. The commission
       has powers to prevent or punish fraud in the sale of securities and
       is authorized to regulate stock exchanges.

     * The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) was created in 1971 as the
       Postal Rate Commission and strengthened under the Postal
       Accountability and Enhancement Act enacted in December 2006.
       Provides regulatory oversight over the activities of the United
       States Postal Service.

     * The Selective Service System (SSS) is an independent federal agency
       operating with permanent authorization under the Military Selective
       Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq.). It is not part of the
       Department of Defense; however, it exists to serve the emergency
       manpower needs of the Military by conscripting untrained men, or
       personnel with professional health care skills, if directed by
       Congress and the President in a national crisis. Its statutory
       missions also include being ready to administer an alternative
       service program, in lieu of military service for men classified as
       conscientious objectors.

     * The Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 to
       advise, assist, and protect the interests of small business
       concerns. The SBA guarantees loans to small businesses, aids
       victims of floods and other natural disasters, promotes the growth
       of minority-owned firms, and helps secure contracts for small
       businesses to supply goods and services to the federal government.

     * The Social Security Administration (SSA) is the United States
       federal agency that administers Social Security, a social insurance
       program consisting of retirement, disability, and survivors'
       benefits. To qualify for these benefits, most American workers pay
       Social Security taxes on their earnings; future benefits are based
       on the employees' contributions.

     * The Surface Transportation Board (STB) was created in the ICC
       Termination Act of 1995 and is the successor agency to the
       Interstate Commerce Commission. The STB is an economic regulatory
       agency that Congress charged with resolving railroad rate and
       service disputes and reviewing proposed railroad mergers. The STB
       is decisionally independent, although it is administratively
       affiliated with the Department of Transportation.

     * The United States Postal Service is defined by statute as an
       "independent establishment" of the federal government, which
       replaced the Cabinet-level Post Office Department in 1971. The
       Postal Service is responsible for the collection, transportation,
       and delivery of the mails, and for the operation of thousands of
       local post offices across the country. It also provides
       international mail service through the Universal Postal Union and
       other agreements with foreign countries.

     * Other independent agencies: the National Credit Union
       Administration (NCUA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission
       (CPSC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
       (formally part of the Federal Reserve Board).

Former agencies[edit]

     * The Committee on Public Information was an agency created to
       influence the U.S. public opinion regarding American participation
       in World War I. Lasting from April 14, 1917, to June 30, 1919 it
       was directed by George Creel. The agency used propaganda available
       to achieve its goals.

     * The Interstate Commerce Commission regulated common carriers and
       was thus able to render far reaching orders, such as the
       desegregation of public transportation. After trucking and
       railroads were largely deregulated, the ICC was replaced with the
       Surface Transportation Board, within the Department of
       Transportation.

     * The United States Maritime Commission was intended to formulate a
       merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred
       modern merchant cargo ships for the U.S. Merchant Marine. It also
       formed the United States Maritime Service. In 1950, its functions
       were transferred to the United States Maritime Administration,
       which later became part of the Department of Transportation.

     * The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was designed to help finance
       projects during the Great Depression. It later helped finance the
       nation's military buildup as World War II approached. Scandals led
       to its eventual dissolution in 1956.

     * The Office of the United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator was
       responsible for the placement and long term storage of radioactive
       waste. It was dissolved in 1995.^[15]

     * The United States Information Agency, which was partially merged
       into the Department of State in 1999.
