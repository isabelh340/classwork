Eligibility[edit]

Eligibility requirements[edit]

   To be eligible to serve as President, a person must be a natural-born
   U.S. citizen, at least thirty-five years old, and a resident within the
   United States for at least 14 years. These eligibility requirements are
   specified both in the U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 1, Clause
   5, and in the Presidential Succession Act (3 U.S.C. § 19(e)).

Acting officers[edit]

   Acting officers may be eligible. In 2009, the Continuity of Government
   Commission, a private non-partisan think tank, reported,

     The language in the current Presidential Succession Act is less
     clear than that of the 1886 Act with respect to Senate confirmation.
     The 1886 Act refers to "such officers as shall have been appointed
     by the advice and consent of the Senate to the office therein
     named..." The current act merely refers to "officers appointed, by
     and with the advice and consent of the Senate." Read literally, this
     means that the current act allows for acting secretaries to be in
     the line of succession as long as they are confirmed by the Senate
     for a post (even for example, the second or third in command within
     a department). It is not uncommon for a second in command to become
     acting secretary when the secretary leaves office. Though there is
     some dispute over this provision, the language clearly permits
     acting secretaries to be placed in the line of succession. (We have
     spoken to acting secretaries who told us they had been placed in the
     line of succession.)^[3]

Motivation for changes to the succession in 1945[edit]

   Two months after succeeding Franklin D. Roosevelt, President Harry S.
   Truman proposed that the Speaker of the House and the President pro
   tempore of the Senate be granted priority in the line of succession
   over the Cabinet so as to ensure the President would not be able to
   appoint his successor to the Presidency.^[4]

   The Secretary of State and the other Cabinet officials are appointed by
   the President, while the Speaker of the House and the President pro
   tempore of the Senate are elected officials. The Speaker is chosen by
   the U.S. House of Representatives, and every Speaker has been a member
   of that body for the duration of their term as Speaker; the President
   pro tempore is chosen by the U.S. Senate and by custom the Senator of
   the majority party with the longest record of continuous service fills
   this position. The Congress approved this change and inserted the
   Speaker and the President pro tempore in line, ahead of the members of
   the Cabinet in the order in which their positions were established.

   In his speech supporting the changes, Truman noted that the House is
   more likely to be in political agreement with the President and Vice
   President than the Senate. The succession of a Republican to a
   Democratic Presidency would further complicate an already unstable
   political situation. However, when the changes to the succession were
   signed into law, they placed Republican House Speaker Joseph W. Martin
   first in the line of succession after the Vice President.^[5]

   Some of Truman's critics said that his ordering of the Speaker before
   the President pro tempore was motivated by his dislike of the
   then-current holder of the latter rank, Senator Kenneth McKellar.^[6]
   Further motivation may have been provided by Truman's preference for
   House Speaker Sam Rayburn to be next in the line of succession, rather
   than Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius, Jr.^[5]

Constitutional foundation[edit]

   The line of succession is mentioned in three places in the
   Constitution: in Article II, Section 1, in Section 3 of the 20th
   Amendment, and in the 25th Amendment.
     * Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 makes the Vice President first in
       the line of succession and allows the Congress to provide by law
       for cases in which neither the President nor Vice President can
       serve. The current such law governing succession is the
       Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (3 U.S.C. § 19).
     * Section 3 of the 20th Amendment provides that if the
       President-elect dies before his term begins, the Vice
       President-elect becomes President on Inauguration Day and serves
       for the full term to which the President-elect was elected. The
       section also provides that if, on Inauguration Day, a president has
       not been chosen or the President-elect does not qualify for the
       presidency, the Vice President-elect acts as president until a
       president is chosen or the President-elect qualifies. Finally,
       Section 3 allows the Congress to provide by law for cases in which
       neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect is eligible or
       available to serve.
     * The 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967, clarified Article II, Section
       1: that the Vice President is the direct successor of the
       President. He or she becomes President if the President dies,
       resigns or is removed from office. The amendment also provides for
       the situation where the President is temporarily disabled, such as
       if the President has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally
       unstable. It also required vice presidential vacancies to be filled
       by the President and confirmed by Congress. Previously, when a vice
       president had succeeded to the presidency or otherwise left the
       office empty (through death, resignation, or removal from office),
       the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential
       election.

Acting President and President[edit]

   Main article: Acting President of the United States
   New President Lyndon Johnson was sworn in aboard Air Force One,
   following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.

   Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution provides that:

          In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his
          death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and
          duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice
          President ... until the disability be removed, or a President
          elected.

   This originally left open the question whether "the same" refers to
   "the said office" or only "the powers and duties of the said office".
   Some historians, including Edward Corwin^[7] and John D. Feerick,^[7]
   have argued that the framers' intention was that the Vice President
   would remain Vice President while executing the powers and duties of
   the presidency; however, there is also much evidence to the contrary,
   the most compelling of which is Article I, section 3, of the
   Constitution itself, the relevant text of which reads:

          The Vice President of the United States shall be President of
          the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally
          divided.
          The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a
          President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or
          when he shall exercise the office of President of the United
          States.

   This text appears to answer the hypothetical question of whether the
   office or merely the powers of the presidency devolved upon the Vice
   President on his succession. Thus, the 25th Amendment merely restates
   and reaffirms the validity of existing precedent, apart from adding
   valuable new protocols for presidential disability. Not everyone agreed
   with this interpretation when it was first put to the test, and it was
   left to John Tyler, the first presidential successor in U.S. history,
   to establish the precedent that was respected in the absence of the
   25th Amendment.
   In 1841, John Tyler became the first person to succeed to the
   presidency.

   Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, after a
   brief hesitation, Vice President John Tyler took the position that he
   was President, and not merely acting President, upon taking the
   presidential oath of office. However, some contemporaries—including
   John Quincy Adams,^[7]^[8] Henry Clay^[9] and other members of
   Congress,^[8]^[9] Whig party leaders,^[9] and even Tyler's own
   cabinet^[8]^[9]—believed that he was only acting as president, and did
   not have the office itself.

   Nonetheless, Tyler adhered to his position, even returning unopened
   mail addressed to the "Acting President of the United States" sent by
   his detractors.^[10] Tyler's view ultimately prevailed when the Senate
   voted to accept the title "President,"^[9] and this precedent was
   followed thereafter. The question was finally resolved by Section 1 of
   the 25th Amendment which specifies that: "In case of the removal of the
   President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice
   President shall become President." The Amendment does not specify
   whether officers other than the Vice President can become President
   rather than Acting President in the same set of circumstances. However,
   the Presidential Succession Act makes clear that anyone who takes
   office under its provisions shall only "act as President"—even if they
   "act" in that role for years. Thus only someone serving as Vice
   President can ever succeed to the title of "President of the United
   States."

History of succession law set by Congress[edit]

Presidential Succession Act 1792[edit]

   Main article: Presidential Succession Act
   Wikisource has original text related to this article:
   Presidential Succession Act 1792

   The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 was the first succession law
   passed by Congress. The act was contentious because the Federalists did
   not want the then Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, who had become
   the leader of the Democratic-Republicans, to follow the Vice President
   in the succession. There were also separation of powers concerns over
   including the Chief Justice of the United States in the line. The
   compromise they worked out established the President pro tempore of the
   Senate as next in line after the Vice President, followed by the
   Speaker of the House of Representatives.

   In either case, these officers were to "act as President of the United
   States until the disability be removed or a president be elected." The
   Act called for a special election to be held in November of the year in
   which dual vacancies occurred (unless the vacancies occurred after the
   first Wednesday in October, in which case the election would occur the
   following year; or unless the vacancies occurred within the last year
   of the presidential term, in which case the next election would take
   place as regularly scheduled). The people elected President and Vice
   President in such a special election would have served a full four-year
   term beginning on March 4 of the next year, but no such election ever
   took place.

Presidential Succession Act 1886[edit]

   Wikisource has original text related to this article:
   Presidential Succession Act 1886

   In 1881, after the death of President Garfield, and in 1885, after the
   death of Vice President Hendricks, there had been no President pro
   tempore in office, and as the new House of Representatives had yet to
   convene, no Speaker either,^[11] leaving no one at all in the line of
   succession after the vice president. When Congress convened in December
   1885, President Cleveland asked for a revision of the 1792 act, which
   was passed in 1886. Congress replaced the President pro tempore and
   Speaker with officers of the President's Cabinet with the Secretary of
   State first in line. In the first 100 years of the United States, six
   former Secretaries of State had gone on to be elected President, while
   only two congressional leaders had advanced to that office. As a
   result, changing the order of the line of succession seemed
   reasonable.^[citation needed]

Presidential Succession Act 1947[edit]

   Wikisource has original text related to this article:
   Presidential Succession Act 1947

   The Presidential Succession Act of 1947, signed into law by President
   Harry S. Truman, added the Speaker of the House and President pro
   tempore back in the line, but switched the two from the 1792 order. It
   remains the sequence used today^[update]. Since the reorganization of
   the military in 1947 had merged the War Department (which governed the
   Army) with the Department of the Navy into the Department of Defense,
   the Secretary of Defense took the place in the order of succession
   previously held by the Secretary of War. The office of Secretary of the
   Navy, which had existed as a Cabinet-level position since 1798, had
   become subordinate to the Secretary of Defense in the military
   reorganization, and so was dropped from the line of succession in the
   1947 Succession Act.

Postmaster General removed 1971[edit]

   Until 1971, the Postmaster General, the head of the Post Office
   Department, was a member of the Cabinet, initially the last in the
   presidential line of succession before new officers were added. Once
   the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States
   Postal Service, a special agency independent of the executive branch,
   the Postmaster General ceased to be a member of the Cabinet and was
   thus removed from the line of succession.

Secretary of Homeland Security added 2006[edit]

   The United States Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002.
   On March 9, 2006 the Secretary of Homeland Security was added to the
   line of succession. The order of Cabinet members in the line has always
   been the same as the order in which their respective departments were
   established. Despite custom, many in Congress had wanted the Secretary
   to be placed at number eight on the list – below the Attorney General,
   above the Secretary of the Interior, and in the position held by the
   Secretary of the Navy prior to the creation of the Secretary of Defense
   – because the Secretary, already in charge of disaster relief and
   security, would presumably be more prepared to take over the presidency
   than some of the other Cabinet secretaries. Despite this the new
   cabinet secretary was placed at the end of the list.

Successions beyond Vice President[edit]

   David Rice Atchison's tombstone, Plattsburg, Missouri, including the
   claim "President of the United States for One Day"

   While nine vice presidents have succeeded to the office upon the death
   or resignation of the President, and two vice presidents have
   temporarily served as acting President, no other officer has ever been
   called upon to act as President.

   On March 4, 1849, President Zachary Taylor's term began, but he
   declined to be sworn in on a Sunday, citing religious beliefs, and the
   vice president was not sworn either. As the last president pro tempore
   of the Senate, David Rice Atchison was thought by some to be next in
   line after the vice president, and his tombstone claims that he was US
   President for the day. However Atchison took no oath of office to the
   presidency either, and his term as Senate president pro tempore had by
   then expired.^[12]^[13]

   In 1865, when Andrew Johnson assumed the presidency on the death of
   Abraham Lincoln, the office of Vice President became vacant. At that
   time, the Senate President pro tempore was next in line to the
   presidency. In 1868 Johnson was impeached, and if he had been removed
   from office, President pro tempore Benjamin Wade would have become
   acting President. This posed a conflict of interest, as Wade's own vote
   on removal could have helped to determine whether he would succeed to
   the presidency.

   In his 1979 book The Shadow Presidents Michael Medved describes a
   situation that arose prior to the 1916 election, when the First World
   War was raging in Europe. In view of the current international turmoil,
   President Woodrow Wilson thought that if he lost the election it would
   be better for his opponent to begin his administration straight away,
   instead of waiting through the lame duck period that at that time was
   almost four months' duration. President Wilson and his aides formed a
   plan to exploit the rule of succession so that his rival Charles Evans
   Hughes could take over the Presidency as soon as the result of the
   election was clear. The plan was that Wilson would appoint Hughes to
   the post of Secretary of State. Wilson and his Vice President Thomas R.
   Marshall would then resign, and as the Secretary of State was at that
   time designated next in line of succession, Hughes would become
   President immediately. In the event, President Wilson won re-election
   so the plan was never put into action.^[14]
   New President Gerald Ford is sworn in following the resignation of
   Richard Nixon

   During the 1973 vice-presidential vacancy, House Speaker Carl
   Albert was first in line. As the Watergate scandal made President
   Nixon's removal or resignation possible, Albert would have become
   Acting President and—under Title 3, Section 19(c) of the U.S.
   Code—would have been able to "act as President until the expiration of
   the then current Presidential term." Albert openly questioned whether
   it was appropriate for him, a Democrat, to assume the powers and duties
   of the presidency when there was a public mandate for the presidency to
   be held by a Republican. Albert announced that should he need to assume
   the presidential powers and duties, he would do so only as a caretaker.
   However, with the nomination and confirmation of Gerald Ford to the
   vice presidency, these series of events were never tested. Albert again
   became first-in-line during the first four months of Ford's presidency,
   before the confirmation of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.

   In 1981, when President Ronald Reagan was shot, Vice President George
   H. W. Bush was traveling in Texas. Secretary of State Alexander Haig
   responded to a reporter's question regarding who was running the
   government by stating;

     Constitutionally, gentlemen, you have the President, the Vice
     President and the Secretary of State in that order, and should the
     President decide he wants to transfer the helm to the Vice
     President, he will do so. He has not done that. As of now, I am in
     control here, in the White House, pending return of the Vice
     President and in close touch with him. If something came up, I would
     check with him, of course.^[15]

   A bitter dispute ensued over the meaning of Haig's remarks. Most people
   believed that Haig was referring to the line of succession and
   erroneously claimed to have temporary presidential authority, due to
   his implied reference to the Constitution. Haig and his supporters,
   noting his familiarity with the line of succession from his time as
   White House Chief of Staff during Richard Nixon's resignation, said he
   only meant that he was the highest-ranking officer of the Executive
   branch on-site, managing things temporarily until the Vice President
   returned to Washington.

Constitutional concerns[edit]

   Several constitutional law experts have raised questions as to the
   constitutionality of the provisions that the Speaker of the House and
   the President pro tempore of the Senate succeed to the presidency.^[16]
   James Madison, one of the authors of the Constitution, raised similar
   constitutional questions about the Presidential Succession Act of 1792
   in a 1792 letter to Edmund Pendleton.^[17] Two of these issues can be
   summarized:
     * The term "Officer" in the relevant clause of the Constitution is
       most plausibly interpreted to mean an "Officer of the United
       States", who must be a member of the Executive or Judicial Branch.
       The Speaker and the President pro tempore are not officers in this
       sense.

     * Under the principle of separation of powers, the Constitution
       specifically disallows legislative officials from also serving in
       the executive branch. For the Speaker or the Senate President pro
       tempore to become Acting President, they must resign their
       position, at which point they are no longer in the line of
       succession. This is seen by some to form a constitutional paradox.
       However, the current Act specifies that taking the oath of office
       of the President of the United States constitutes automatic
       resignation from Congress,^[18] allowing for a seamless transition.

   In 2003 the Continuity of Government Commission suggested that the
   current law has "at least seven significant issues ... that warrant
   attention", including:^[19]
    1. The reality that all figures in the current line of succession work
       and reside in the vicinity of Washington, D.C. In the event of a
       nuclear, chemical, or biological attack, it is possible that
       everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated.
    2. Doubt (such as those expressed above by James Madison) that
       congressional leaders are eligible to act as President.
    3. A concern about the wisdom of including the President pro tempore
       in the line of succession as the "largely honorific post
       traditionally held by the longest-serving Senator of the majority
       party". For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the
       President pro tempore was then-98-year-old Strom Thurmond of South
       Carolina.
    4. A concern that the current line of succession can force the
       presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the President,
       Speaker, and the President pro tempore are not necessarily of the
       same party as each other.
    5. A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of
       creation of the various executive departments, without regard to
       the skills or capacities of the persons serving as their Secretary.
    6. The fact that, should a Cabinet member begin to act as President,
       the law allows the House to elect a new Speaker (or the Senate, a
       new President pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet
       member and assume the office themselves at any time.
    7. The absence of a provision where a President is disabled and the
       vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt
       simultaneously wounded the President and killed the Vice
       President).
