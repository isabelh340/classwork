   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Not to be confused with the Library of Efficient Data types and
   Algorithms (LEDA)

   Leda is a multiparadigm programming language whose goal is to
   successfully mix imperative, object-oriented, functional, and
   logic-based programming features into one language.

   It is described in the book Multiparadigm Programming in Leda^[1]
   written by the principal designer Dr. Timothy Budd at Oregon State
   University.
