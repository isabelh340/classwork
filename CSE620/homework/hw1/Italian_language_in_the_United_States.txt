   The Italian language has been a widely spoken language in the United
   States of America for more than one hundred years, due to large-scale
   immigration beginning in the late 19th century. Today it is the eighth
   most spoken language in the country.

History[edit]

   In Little Italy, Chicago, some Italian language signage is visible
   (e.g. Banca Italiana)

   The first Italian Americans began to immigrate en masse began around
   1880. The first Italian immigrants, mainly from Sicily and other parts
   of Southern Italy, were largely men, and many planned to return to the
   Italy after making money in the US, so the speaker population of
   Italian was not always constant or continuous. Between 1890 and 1900,
   655,888 Italians went to the United States, and more than 2 million
   between 1900 and 1910, though around 40% of these eventually returned
   to Italy. All told, between 1820 and 1978, some 5.3 million Italians
   went to the United States. Like many ethnic groups, such as the Germans
   in Little Germany, French Canadians in Little Canadas, and Chinese in
   Chinatowns, who emigrated to the Americas, the Italians often lived in
   ethnic enclaves, often known as Little Italies, especially in New York
   City, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia, and continued to speak their
   original languages.

During World War II[edit]

   This propaganda discourages the use of Italian, German, and Japanese.

   During World War Two, use of Italian languages in the U.S. was
   discouraged. In addition, many Italian-Americans were interned [1],
   property was confiscated [2], and Italian-language periodicals were
   closed^[citation needed].

   Today, though 15,638,348 American citizens report themselves as Italian
   Americans, only 1,008,370 of these report speaking an Italian language
   at home (0.384% of the national population). But Italian is the 3rd
   foreign language spoken at home in US and it represents the 2nd largest
   ethnic market in the US behind only the Hispanic market.^[6] Cities
   with Italian and Sicilian speaking communities include Buffalo,
   Chicago, Miami, New York City and Philadelphia. Assimilation has played
   a large role in the decreasing amount of Italian speakers today. Of
   those who speak Italian at home in the United States, 361,245 are over
   the age of 65, and only 68,030 are below the age of 17.

   Despite it being the fifth most studied language in higher education
   (college & graduate) settings throughout America,^[7] the Italian
   language has struggled to maintain being an AP course of study in high
   schools nationwide. It was only in 2006 where AP Italian classes were
   first introduced, and they were soon dropped from the national
   curricula after the spring of 2009.^[8] The organization which manages
   such curricula, the College Board, ended the AP Italian program because
   it was "losing money" and had failed to add 5,000 new students each
   year. Since the programs termination in the spring of 2009, various
   Italian organizations and activists have attempted to revive the course
   of study. For example, Margaret Cuomo, sister of New York Governor
   Andrew Cuomo, was the impetus for the program's birth in 2006 and is
   currently attempting to secure funding and teachers to reinstate the
   program. Also, Italian organizations have begun fundraisers to revive
   AP Italian. Organizations such as the National Italian American
   Foundation (NIAF) and Order Sons of Italy in America have made strides
   in collecting money, and are prepared to aid in the monetary
   responsibility any new AP Italian program would bring with it.

   Moreover, web based Italian organizations, such as ItalianAware, have
   begun book donation campaigns to improve the status and representation
   of Italian language and Italian/ Italian American literature in New
   York Public Libraries. According to ItalianAware, the Brooklyn Public
   Library is the worst offender in New York City.^[9] It has 11 books
   pertaining to the Italian language and immigrant experience available
   for checkout spread across 60 branches. That amounts to 1 book for
   every 6 branches in Brooklyn, which (according to ItalianAware) cannot
   supply the large Italian/Italian American community in Brooklyn, New
   York. ItalianAware aims to donate 100 various books on the Italian/
   Italian American experience, written in Italian or English, to the
   Brooklyn Public Library by the end of 2010.

Forms of Italian[edit]

   Traditionally, most Italian Americans did not speak Standard Italian
   which originated from the Tuscan language. Instead they spoke other
   Italo-Romance varieties, particularly from Southern Italy, such as
   Calabrese, Neapolitan, and other Southern Italian dialects, as well as
   the Sicilian language. Today, the Standard Italian language, which is
   most similar to the Tuscan (although not the same), is used in schools
   instead of the other dialects and languages.

Media[edit]

   Although the Italian language is much less used today than it has been
   previously, there are still several Italian-only media outlets, among
   which are the New Jersey daily paper America Oggi and ICN Radio.

   Il Progresso Italo Americano was edited by Carlo Barsotti
   (1850â€“1927).^[10]

   Arba Sicula (Sicilian Dawn) is a semiannual publication of the society
   of the same name, dedicated to preserving the Sicilian language. The
   magazine and a periodic newsletter offer prose, poetry and comment in
   Sicilian, with adjacent English translations.
