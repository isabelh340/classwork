   The Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States
   Constitution prohibits any United States citizen from being denied the
   right to vote on the basis of sex. It was ratified on August 18, 1920.
   The Constitution allows the states to determine the qualifications for
   voting, and until the 1910s most states disenfranchised women. The
   amendment was the culmination of the women's suffrage movement in the
   United States, which fought at both state and national levels to
   achieve the vote. It effectively overruled Minor v. Happersett, in
   which a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did
   not give women the right to vote.

   Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton drafted the amendment and
   first introduced it in 1878; it was forty-one years later, in 1919,
   when the Congress submitted the amendment to the states for
   ratification. A year later, it was ratified by the requisite number of
   states, with Tennessee's ratification being the final vote needed to
   add the amendment to the Constitution. In Leser v. Garnett (1922), the
   Supreme Court rejected claims that the amendment was unconstitutionally
   adopted.

Text

     The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be
     denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account
     of sex.

     Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
     legislation.

Background

   The United States Constitution, adopted in 1789, left the boundaries of
   suffrage undefined. The only directly elected body created by the
   original Constitution was the House of Representatives, for which voter
   qualifications were explicitly delegated to the individual states.^[1]
   At that time, all states denied voting rights to women (with the
   exception of New Jersey, which initially carried women's suffrage but
   revoked it in 1807).

   While scattered movements and organizations dedicated to women's rights
   existed previously, the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention in New York is
   traditionally held as the start of the American women's rights
   movement. Suffrage was not a focus of the convention, however, and its
   advancement was minimal in the decades preceding the Civil War. While
   suffrage bills were introduced into most state legislatures during this
   period, they were generally disregarded and few came to a vote.^[2]

   The women's suffrage movement took hold after the Civil War, during the
   Reconstruction era (1865–1877). During this period, women's rights
   leaders advocated for inclusion of universal suffrage as a civil right
   in the Reconstruction amendments (the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and
   Fifteenth Amendments). Despite their efforts, these amendments did
   nothing to promote women's suffrage.^[3]^[4] Section 2 of the
   Fourteenth Amendment explicitly discriminated between men and women by
   penalizing states who deprived adult male citizens of the vote, but not
   for denying the vote to adult female citizens.^[5]
   Women's suffrage laws before adoption of the Nineteenth
   Amendment^[6]^[7]
     Full suffrage
     Presidential suffrage
     Primary suffrage
     Municipal suffrage
     School, bond, or tax suffrage
     Municipal suffrage in some cities
     Primary suffrage in some cities
     No suffrage

   Continued settlement of the western frontier, along with the
   establishment of territorial constitutions, allowed the issue to be
   raised continually at the state level. Through the activism of suffrage
   organizations and independent political parties, women's suffrage was
   established in the newly formed constitutions of Wyoming Territory
   (1869), Utah (1870), and Washington Territory (1883).^[4] Existing
   state legislatures began to consider suffrage bills, and several even
   held voter referenda, but they were unsuccessful.^[8] Efforts at the
   national level persisted through a strategy of congressional testimony,
   petitioning, and lobbying.^[9]

   Two rival organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA)
   and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), were formed in
   1869.^[3] The NWSA, led by suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
   Susan B. Anthony, attempted several unsuccessful court challenges in
   the mid-1870s.^[8] Their legal case, known as the New Departure
   strategy, was that the Fourteenth Amendment (granting universal
   citizenship) and Fifteenth Amendment (granting the vote irrespective of
   race) together served to guarantee voting rights to women. Three
   Supreme Court decisions from 1873 to 1875 rejected this argument, so
   these groups shifted to advocating for a new constitutional
   amendment.^[10]

Proposal and ratification

   Elizabeth Cady Stanton (seated) and Susan B. Anthony c. 1900

   The Nineteenth Amendment's text was drafted by Susan B. Anthony with
   the assistance of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.^[11] The proposed amendment
   was first introduced in the Senate, colloquially as the "Anthony
   Amendment", by Republican Senator Aaron A. Sargent of California.
   Sargent, who had met and befriended Anthony on a train ride in 1872,
   was a dedicated women's suffrage advocate. He had frequently attempted
   to insert women's suffrage provisions into unrelated bills, but did not
   formally introduce a constitutional amendment until January 1878.^[12]
   Stanton and other women testified before the Senate in support of the
   amendment.^[13] The proposal sat in a committee until it was considered
   by the full Senate and rejected in a 16 to 34 vote in 1887.^[11]

   A three-decade period known as "the doldrums" followed, during which
   the amendment was not considered by Congress and the women's suffrage
   movement achieved few victories.^[14]^[15] During this period, the
   suffragists pressed for the right to vote in the laws of individual
   states and territories while retaining the goal of federal
   recognition.^[11] A flurry of activity began in 1910 and 1911 with
   surprise successes in Washington and California.^[14] Over the next few
   years, most western states passed legislation or voter referenda
   enacting full or partial suffrage for women.^[16] These successes were
   linked to the 1912 election, which saw the rise of the Progressive and
   Socialist parties, as well as the election of Democratic President
   Woodrow Wilson.^[14]^[15] Not until 1914 was the constitutional
   amendment again considered by the Senate, where it was again
   rejected.^[11]

   Carrie Chapman Catt was instrumental in the final push to gain
   ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. In 1900, she succeeded Susan
   B. Anthony as the president of the National American Woman Suffrage
   Association (NAWSA). Starting in 1915, Catt revitalized NAWSA and led a
   successful campaign in New York to achieve state-level suffrage in
   1917. When the U.S. entered World War I, Catt made the controversial
   decision to support the war effort, despite the widespread pacifist
   sentiment of many of her colleagues and supporters.^[17] NAWSA women’s
   work to aid the war effort turned them into highly visible symbols of
   nationalism.

   The republican work of NAWSA stood in contrast to the more radical and
   aggressive tactics of the National Woman's Party (NWP) led by Alice
   Paul and Lucy Burns. In 1917, the NWP staged controversial
   demonstrations in Washington, D.C. to draw attention away from the war
   and back to women’s suffrage. Catt was successful in turning NAWSA into
   a patriotic organization, entirely separate from the NWP, and was
   rewarded when President Wilson spoke out in favor of women’s suffrage
   in his 1918 State of the Union address before Congress.^[18]
   Speaker Frederick H. Gillett signing the constitutional amendment bill

   Another proposal was brought before the House on January 10, 1918.
   During the previous evening, President Wilson made a strong and widely
   published appeal to the House to pass the amendment. It was passed by
   the required two-thirds of the House, with only one vote to spare. The
   vote was then carried into the Senate. Wilson again made an appeal, but
   on September 30, 1918, the proposal fell two votes short of passage. On
   February 10, 1919, it was again voted upon and failed by only one vote.

   There was considerable desire among politicians of both parties to have
   the proposal made part of the Constitution before the 1920 general
   elections, so the President called a special session of the Congress so
   the proposal would be brought before the House again. On May 21, 1919,
   it passed the House, 42 votes more than necessary being obtained. On
   June 4, 1919, it was brought before the Senate and, after a long
   discussion, it was passed with 56 ayes and 25 nays. Within a few days,
   Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan ratified the amendment, their
   legislatures being in session. Other states followed suit at a regular
   pace, until the amendment had been ratified by 35 of the necessary 36
   state legislatures. Much of the opposition to the amendment came from
   Southern Democrats, a trend which remained consistent with Tennessee as
   the last state to pass the amendment, during a special session right
   before the ratification period was to expire.^[19] On August 18, 1920,
   Tennessee narrowly approved the Nineteenth Amendment, with 50 of 99
   members of the Tennessee House of Representatives voting yes.^[20] This
   provided the final ratification necessary to add the amendment to the
   Constitution.^[21]

Leser v. Garnett

   Louis Brandeis
   Justice Louis Brandeis, author of the Supreme Court's opinion in Leser
   v. Garnett^[25]

   The amendment's validity was unanimously upheld in Leser v. Garnett,
   258 U.S. 130 (1922).^[26]

   Oscar Leser sued to stop two women registered to vote in Baltimore,
   Maryland, because he believed that the Maryland Constitution limited
   the suffrage to men and the Maryland legislature had refused to vote to
   ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. Two months before, the federal
   government had proclaimed the amendment incorporated into the
   Constitution on August 26, 1920.^[26]

   First, Leser said the amendment "destroyed State autonomy" because it
   increased Maryland's electorate without the state's consent. The Court
   answered that the Nineteenth Amendment was worded like the Fifteenth
   Amendment, which had expanded state electorates without regard to race
   for over 50 years by that time despite being rejected by six states,
   including Maryland.^[25]^[26]

   Second, Leser claimed that the state constitutions in some ratifying
   states did not allow their legislatures to ratify. The Court replied
   that state ratification was a federal function which came from Article
   V of the Constitution and so is not subject to limitations by a state
   constitution.^[26]

   Third, those bringing suit asserted the Nineteenth Amendment was not
   adopted, because Tennessee and West Virginia violated their own rules
   of procedure. The Court ruled that the point was moot, because since
   then Connecticut and Vermont had ratified the amendment and so there
   was a sufficient number of ratifications for the Nineteenth Amendment
   to be considered adopted even without Tennessee and West Virginia.
   Also, the Court ruled that Tennessee and West Virginia's certifying of
   their ratifications was binding and had been duly authenticated by the
   Secretary of State.^[26]

   Thus, the two women were permitted to be registered to vote in
   Baltimore.^[26]

Effects

   Following the Nineteenth Amendment's adoption, many legislators feared
   that a powerful women's bloc would emerge in American politics. This
   led to the passage of such laws as the Sheppard–Towner Act of 1921,
   which expanded maternity care during the 1920s.^[27] However, a women's
   bloc did not emerge in American politics until the 1950s.^[28]
