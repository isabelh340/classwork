   The Spanish language is the second most used language in the United
   States, where it is also known as American Spanish (Spanish: Español
   americano). There are more Spanish speakers in the United States than
   there are speakers of Chinese, French, German, Italian, Hawaiian, and
   the Native American languages combined. According to the 2012 American
   Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, Spanish is the
   primary language spoken at home by 38.3 million people aged five or
   older, a figure more than double that of 1990.^[1]^[2]

   There are 45 million Hispanophones who speak Spanish as a first or
   second language,^[3] as well as six million Spanish language
   students,^[4] comprising the largest national Spanish-speaking
   community outside of Mexico and making Spanish the Romance language and
   the Indo-European language with the largest number of native speakers
   in the world.^[5] Roughly half of all U.S. Spanish speakers also speak
   English "very well," based on the self-assessment Census question
   respondents.^[6]

   The Spanish language has been present since the 16th and 17th centuries
   with the arrival of Spanish colonists in areas that would later become
   the states of Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada,
   Utah, and California and of the Spanish explorers - who explored areas
   of 42 future states. The western regions of the Louisiana Territory
   were under Spanish rule between 1763–1800 (year of the French recovery
   of territory), after the French and Indian War.

   After the incorporation of these states to the U.S. in first half of
   19th century, the Spanish language was later reinforced by the
   acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898 and later waves of emigration from
   Mexico, Cuba, El Salvador and elsewhere in Hispanic America, to the
   United States beginning in the second half of 19th century to the
   present-day.

History[edit]

   See also: Hispanic Heritage Sites (U.S. National Park Service)

   Spanish was the language spoken by the first permanent European
   settlers in North America. Spanish arrived in the territory of the
   contemporary United States with Ponce de León in 1513. In 1565, the
   Spaniards, by way of Juan Ponce de León, founded St. Augustine,
   Florida, and as of the early 1800s, it became the oldest continuously
   occupied European settlement in the continental United States. The
   oldest city in all of the U.S. territory, as of 1898, is San Juan,
   capital of Puerto Rico, where Juan Ponce De León was its first governor

   Historically, the Spanish-speaking population increased because of
   territorial annexation of lands claimed earlier by the Spanish empire
   and by wars with Mexico and by land purchases, while modern factors
   continue increasing the size of this population.

Adams–Onís Treaty[edit]

   In 1819 Florida was sold by Spain to the United States by Adams–Onís
   Treaty; many Spanish settlers, whose ancestors came from Cuba,
   Andalusia, and the Canary Islands, became U.S. citizens and continued
   to speak Spanish.

Louisiana Purchase (1803–1804)[edit]

   Further information: Louisiana Purchase

   In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, land claimed by Spain
   encompassed a large part of the contemporary U.S. territory, including
   the French colony of Louisiana that was under Spanish occupation from
   1769 to 1800, and then part of the United States since 1803. When
   Louisiana was sold to the United States, its Spanish and French
   inhabitants became U.S. citizens, and continued to speak French and
   Spanish.

Annexation of Texas and the Mexican-American War[edit]

   Buildings influenced by Spanish colonial architecture in Los Angeles'
   Plaza Historic District. The Spanish language in the Southwestern
   United States spans many centuries.
   Spanish language heritage in Florida dates back to 1565, with the
   founding of Saint Augustine, Florida. Spanish was the first European
   language spoken in Florida.

   In 1821,^[7] after Mexico's War of Independence from Spain, Texas was
   part of the United Mexican States as the state of Coahuila y Tejas. A
   large influx of Americans soon followed, originally with the approval
   of Mexico's president. In 1836, the now largely "American" Texans,
   fought a war of independence from the central government of Mexico and
   established the Republic of Texas. In 1846, the Republic dissolved when
   Texas entered the U.S. as a state. Per the 1850 U.S. census, fewer than
   16,000 Texans were of Mexican descent, and nearly all were
   Spanish-speaking people (both Mexicans and non-Spanish European
   settlers who include German Texan) who were outnumbered (six-to-one) by
   English-speaking settlers (both Americans and other immigrant
   Europeans).^[citation needed]

   After Mexican War of Independence from Spain also, California, Nevada,
   Arizona, Utah, western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming became part of
   the Mexican state of Alta California and most of New Mexico, western
   Texas, southern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and Oklahoma panhandle
   were part of the state of Santa Fe de Nuevo México.

   Mexico lost almost half of the northern territory gained from Spain in
   1821 to the United States in the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). This
   included parts of contemporary Texas, and Colorado, Arizona, New
   Mexico, and Wyoming, California, Nevada, and Utah. Although the lost
   territory was sparsely populated, the thousands of Spanish-speaking
   Mexicans subsequently became U.S. citizens. The war-ending Treaty of
   Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) does not explicitly address language.

   Through the force of sheer numbers, the English-speaking American
   settlers entering the Southwest established their language, culture,
   and law as dominant, to the extent it fully displaced Spanish in the
   public sphere; this is why the U.S. never developed bilingualism as
   Canada did. For example, the California constitutional convention of
   1849 had eight Californio participants; the resulting state
   constitution was produced in English and Spanish, and it contained a
   clause requiring all published laws and regulations to be published in
   both languages. The constitutional convention of 1872 had no
   Spanish-speaking participants; the convention's English-speaking
   participants felt that the state's remaining minority of Spanish
   speakers should simply learn English; and the convention ultimately
   voted 46-39 to revise the earlier clause so that all official
   proceedings would henceforth be published only in English.^[8]

Spanish-American War (1898)[edit]

   Further information: Spanish-American War

   In 1898, consequent to the Spanish-American War, the United States took
   control of Cuba and Puerto Rico, Philippines and Guam as American
   territories. In 1902, Cuba became independent from the United States,
   while Puerto Rico remained a U.S. Territory. Spanish is Puerto Rico's
   first language, and its citizens hold statutory U.S. citizenship.

   For decades, the U.S. federal government strenuously tried to force
   Puerto Ricans to adopt English, to the extent of making them use
   English as the primary language of instruction in their high schools,
   but was completely unsuccessful and retreated from that policy in 1948.
   Puerto Rico was able to maintain its Spanish language, culture, and
   identity because the relatively small, densely populated island was
   already home to nearly a million people at the time of the U.S.
   takeover, and it was never hit with a massive invasion of millions of
   English speakers like the vast territory previously acquired from
   Mexico 50 years earlier.

   This policy was more successful in the Philippines, where only about
   20% of the population had Spanish as their first language, but those
   were disseminated along the islands. Eventually the migrations caused
   by WWII broke the surviving Spanish speaking communities. The usage of
   Spanish among elders is still quite large, however.

Modern mass migration[edit]

   The relatively recent but large influx of Spanish speakers to the
   United States has increased the overall total of Spanish-speakers in
   the country. They form majorities and large minorities in many
   political districts, especially in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and
   Texas, the U.S. states bordering Mexico, and also in South Florida.

   Mexicans moved to United States as refugees in the turmoil of Mexican
   Revolution from 1910 - 1917. The large majority of Mexicans are in the
   former Mexican-controlled areas in Southwest.

   Immigration to the United States of Spanish-speaking Cubans began
   because of Cuba's political instability upon achieving independence.
   The deposition of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship and the ascension of
   Fidel Castro's government in 1959 increased Cuban immigration to the
   United States, hence there are some one million Cubans in the United
   States, most settled in southern and central Florida, while other
   Cubans live in the Northeastern United States; most are fluent in
   Spanish. In the city of Miami today Spanish is the first language
   mostly due to Cuban immigration.

   Likewise the migration of Spanish-speaking Nicaraguans also began as a
   result of political instability during the end of the 1970s and the
   1980s. The uprising of the Sandinista revolution which toppled the
   Somoza dictatorship in 1979 caused many Nicaraguans to migrate
   particularly from those opposing the Sandinistas. Throughout the 1980s
   with the U.S. supported Contra War (or Contra-revolutionary war) which
   continued up until 1988, and the economic collapse of the country many
   more Nicaraguans migrated to the United States amongst other countries.
   The states of the United States where most Nicaraguans migrated to
   include Florida, California and Texas.

   Texas. Bilingual education is popular in school districts with large
   numbers of Spanish speakers.

   The exodus of Salvadorans was a result of both economic and political
   problems. The largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the
   Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, in which 20-30% of El Salvador's
   population emigrated. About 50%, or up to 500,000 of those who escaped
   headed to the U.S., which was already home to over 10,000 Salvadorans,
   making Salvadorans Americans the third-largest Hispanic and Latino
   American group, after the Mexican-American majority and the Cubans
   (when not including stateside Puerto Ricans).

   As civil wars engulfed several Central American countries in the 1980s,
   hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled their country and came to the
   United States. Between 1980 and 1990, the Salvadoran immigrant
   population in the United States increased nearly fivefold from 94,000
   to 465,000. The number of Salvadoran immigrants in the United States
   continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family
   reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters
   that hit El Salvador, including earthquakes and hurricanes. By 2008,
   there were about 1.1 million Salvadoran immigrants in the United
   States. The majority of Salvadorans settled California, Texas,
   Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

   Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of
   Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States. Between the 18th and
   early 19th centuries, there were many European immigrants who went to
   Venezuela, only to later migrate to the United States along with their
   children and grandchildren who born and/or grew up in Venezuela
   speaking Spanish. From 1910 to 1930, it is estimated that over 4,000
   South Americans each year emigrated to the United States; however,
   there are few specific figures indicating these statistics. Many
   Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a
   better education, only to remain in there following graduation. They
   are frequently joined by relatives. However, since the early 1980s, the
   reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of
   earning a higher salary and due to the economic fluctuations in
   Venezuela which also promoted an important migration of Venezuelan
   professionals to the US.^[9]

   In the 2000s, more Venezuelans opposing the economic and political
   policies of president Hugo Chávez migrated to the U.S. (mostly to
   Florida, but New York City and Houston are other destinations). The
   largest concentration of Venezuelans in the United States is in South
   Florida, especially the suburbs of Doral and Weston. Other main states
   with Venezuelan American populations are, according the 1990 census,
   New York, California, Texas (adding their existing Hispanic
   populations), New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland. Some of the urban
   areas with a high Venezuelan community include Miami, New York City,
   Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.^[9]

   As all Puerto Ricans are natural-born U.S. citizens, many Puerto Ricans
   have migrated to New York City, increasing its Spanish-speaking
   population. Millions of Puerto Rican Americans living in the U.S.
   mainland are fluent in Spanish. In Hawaii, where Puerto Rican farm
   laborers and Mexican ranchers have settled since the late 19th century,
   7.0 per cent of the islands' people are either Hispanic or Hispanophone
   or both.^[citation needed]

   Migration of refugees from Spain began also because of civil war
   between 1936 & 1939 and political instability under the regime of
   Francisco Franco that lasted to 1975. The majority of Spaniards settled
   Florida, Texas, California, New Jersey, New York City, Chicago, and
   Puerto Rico.

Geographic distribution[edit]

   Spanish-speaking population

   In total, there were 36,995,602 people aged five or older in the United
   States who spoke Spanish at home (12.8% of the total U.S.
   population).^[10] Over half of the country's Spanish speakers reside in
   California, Texas, and Florida.

Current status[edit]

   Spanish is the most widely taught second language in the United States
   Public elementary school sign in Spanish in Memphis, Tennessee.

   Services

   Although the United States has no official language, English is the
   dominant language of business, education, government, religion, media,
   culture, civil society, and the public sphere. Virtually all state and
   federal government agencies and large corporations use English as their
   internal working language, especially at the management level. Some
   states, such as New Mexico, provide bilingual legislated notices and
   official documents, in Spanish and English, and other commonly used
   languages.

   As noted above, the only major exception is the U.S. Commonwealth of
   Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the official and most commonly used
   language.

   Throughout the history of the Southwest United States, the
   controversial issues of language as part of cultural rights and
   bilingual state government representation has caused socio-cultural
   friction between Anglophones and Hispanophones. Currently, Spanish is
   the most widely taught second language in the United States.^[15]

California California[edit]

   California's first constitution recognized Spanish language rights:

     All laws, decrees, regulations, and provisions emanating from any of
     the three supreme powers of this State, which from their nature
     require publication, shall be published in English and Spanish.

   —California Constitution, 1849, Art. XI Sec. 21.

   By 1870, English-speaking Americans were a majority in California; in
   1879, the state promulgated a new constitution under which all official
   proceedings were to be conducted exclusively in English, a clause that
   remained in effect until 1966. In 1986, California voters added a new
   constitutional clause, by referendum, stating that:

     English is the official language of the State of California.

   —California Constitution, Art. 3, Sec. 6

   Spanish remains widely spoken throughout the state, and many government
   forms, documents, and services are bilingual, in English and Spanish.
   And although all official proceedings are to be conducted in English:

     A person unable to understand English who is charged with a crime
     has a right to an interpreter throughout the proceedings.

   —California Constitution, Art. 1. Sec. 14

Arizona Arizona[edit]

   The state (like its southwestern neighbors) has had close linguistic
   and cultural ties with Mexico. The state outside the Gadsden Purchase
   of 1853 was part of the New Mexico Territory until 1863, when the
   western half was made into the Arizona Territory. The area of the
   former Gadsden Purchase contained a majority of Spanish-speakers until
   the 1940s, although the Tucson area had a higher ratio of anglophones
   (including Mexican Americans who were fluent in English); the
   continuous arrival of Mexican settlers increases the number of Spanish
   speakers.

New Mexico New Mexico[edit]

   Main article: New Mexican Spanish

   New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language
   alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of
   Spanish in the state; however, the state has no official language. New
   Mexico's laws are promulgated bilingually in Spanish and English.
   Although English is the state government's paper working language,
   government business is often conducted in Spanish, particularly at the
   local level. Spanish has been spoken in the New Mexico-Colorado border
   and the contemporary U.S.–Mexico border since the 16th
   century.^[citation needed]

   Because of its relative isolation from other Spanish speaking areas
   over most of its 400 year existence, New Mexico Spanish, and in
   particular the Spanish of northern New Mexico and Colorado has retained
   many elements of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish and has developed its
   own vocabulary.^[16] In addition, it contains many words from Nahuatl,
   the language spoken by the ancient Aztecs of Mexico. New Mexican
   Spanish also contains loan words from the Pueblo languages of the upper
   Rio Grande Valley, Mexican-Spanish words (mexicanismos), and borrowings
   from English.^[16] Grammatical changes include the loss of the second
   person verb form, changes in verb endings, particularly in the
   preterite, and partial merging of the second and third
   conjugations.^[17]

   In Texas, English is the state's de facto official language (though it
   lacks de jure status) and is used in government. However, the continual
   influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants increased the import of Spanish
   in Texas. Texas's counties bordering Mexico are mostly Hispanic, and
   consequently, Spanish is commonly spoken in the region. The Government
   of Texas, through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates
   that state agencies provide information on their websites in Spanish to
   assist residents who have limited English proficiency.^[18]

Puerto Rico Puerto Rico[edit]

   official languages; Spanish is the dominant first language.

Learning trends in the United States[edit]

   Spanish is currently the most widely taught non-English language in
   U.S. secondary schools and of higher education.^[19] More than 1.4
   million university students were enrolled in language courses in autumn
   of 2002 and Spanish is the most widely taught language in American
   colleges and universities with 53 percent of the total number of people
   enrolled, followed by French (14.4%), German (7.1%) Italian (4.5%),
   American Sign language (4.3%), Japanese (3.7%), and Chinese (2.4%)
   although the totals remain relatively small in relation to the total
   U.S population.^[20]^[21]

Variation[edit]

   La Época is an upscale Miami department store, whose Spanish name comes
   from Cuba. La Época is an example of the many businesses started and
   owned by Spanish speakers in the US.

   The influence of English on American Spanish is very important. In many
   Latino^[22] (also called Hispanic) youth subcultures, it is fashionable
   to variously mix Spanish and English, thereby producing Spanglish.
   Spanglish is the name for the admixture of English words and phrases to
   Spanish for effective communication.

   The new generation of American Hispanics want to preserve knowing and
   using Spanish as equal to learning and using English. The Academia
   Norteamericana de la Lengua Española (North American Academy of the
   Spanish Language) tracks the developments of the Spanish spoken in the
   United States, and the influences of English upon it.^[citation needed]

Spanish sub-types[edit]

   Language experts distinguish the following varieties of the Spanish

       continental United States
     * New Mexican (1598–present)

   Most post-first generations of Spanish speakers tend to speak the
   language with American English accents of the region they grew up in.

Phonetic features[edit]

   First settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, today, 19% of
   Floridians speak Spanish, and is the most widely taught second
   language. In Miami, 67% of residents spoke Spanish as their first
   language in 2000.

     * As most of ancestors of Hispanic Americans came from Latin America,
       〈z〉 and 〈c〉 (before /e/ and /i/) are pronounced as [s], the same as
       〈s〉. However, seseo is also typical on the speech of Hispanic
       Americans of Andalusian and Canarian descent. Andalusia's and the
       Canary Island's predominant position in the conquest and subsequent
       immigration to Latin America from Spain is thought to be the reason
       for the absence of this distinction in most Latin American
       dialects. Most Americans of Spanish descent pronounce the 2 letters
       as [θ].

     * Most of Spain, particularly the regions that have a distinctive [θ]
       phoneme, realize /s/ with the tip of tongue against the alveolar
       ridge. Phonetically this is an "apico-alveolar" "grave" sibilant
       [s̺], with a weak "hushing" sound reminiscent of retroflex
       fricatives. To a Hispanic and Latino American speaker, European
       Spanish /s/ is close to [ʃ] like English sh as in she. Albeit, this
       apico-alveolar realization of /s/ is not uncommon in some Latin
       American Spanish dialects which lack [θ]; some inland Colombian
       Spanish (particularly Antioquia) and Andean regions of Peru and
       Bolivia also have an apico-alveolar /s/.

     * Spanish in United States usually features yeísmo—that is, there is
       no distinction between /ll/ and /y/, and both are [ʝ]. However,
       Yeísmo is an expanding and now dominant feature of European
       Spanish, particularly in urban speech (Madrid, Toledo) and
       especially in Andalusia and Canary Islands, though in rural use [ʎ]
       is preserved, not only in central and northern Spain, but also in
       scatter areas of Andalusia and the Canary Islands. Speakers of
       Rioplatense Spanish pronounce both /ll/ and /y/ as [ʒ] or [ʃ]. The
       traditional pronunciation of the digraph /ll/ [ʎ] is preserved in
       some dialects along the Andes range, especially in inland Peru and
       Colombia highlands (Santander), northern Argentina, all Bolivia and
       Paraguay.

     * Most speakers with ancestors born in coastal dialects may
       debuccalize or aspirate syllable-final /s/ to [h], or drop it
       entirely, so that está [esˈta] ("s/he is") sounds like [ehˈta] or
       [eˈta], as in southern Spain (Andalusia, Murcia, Castile–La Mancha
       (except North-East), Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla).

     * The 〈g〉 (before /e/ or /i/) and 〈j〉 is usually aspirated to [h] as
       in most southern Spanish speeches; while it may be [x] in other
       dialects of Latino Americans and often firmly strong (rough) in
       Peruvian Spanish dialect, this is a common feature of Castilian
       Spanish. Very often, especially in Argentina and Chile, [x] becomes
       fronter [ç] when preceding high vowels /e, i/ (these speakers
       approach [x] to the realization of German ch in ich).

     * In many Caribbean speeches the phonemes /l/ and /r/ at the end of a
       syllable sound alike or can be exchanged: caldo > ca[r]do, cardo >
       ca[l]do, in the situation of /r/ in word-final position, it becomes
       silent, giving Caribbean dialects of Spanish a partial
       non-rhoticity. This happens at a reduced level in Ecuador and
       Chile^[citation needed] as well and is a feature brought from
       Extremadura and westernmost Andalusia.

     * In many Andean regions the alveolar trill of rata and carro is
       realized as an alveolar approximant [ɹ] or even as a voiced
       apico-alveolar /z/. The alveolar approximant realization is
       particularly associated with a native American substrate and it is
       quite common in Andean regions, especially in inland Ecuador, Peru,
       most of Bolivia and in parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay.

     * The voiced consonants /b/, /d/, and /ɡ/ are pronounced as plosives
       after and sometimes before any consonant in most of Colombian
       Spanish dialects (rather than the fricative or approximant that is
       characteristic of most other dialects). Thus pardo [ˈpaɾdo], barba
       [ˈbaɾba], algo [ˈalɡo], peligro [peˈliɡɾo], desde
       [ˈdezde/ˈdehde]—rather than the [ˈpaɾðo], [ˈbaɾβa], [ˈalɣo],
       [peˈliɣɾo], [ˈdezðe/ˈdehðe] of Spain and the rest of Spanish
       America. A notable exception is the Department of Nariño and most
       Costeño speech (Atlantic coastal dialects) which feature the soft,
       fricative realizations common to all other Hispanic American and
       European dialects.

     * Word-final /n/ is velar [ŋ] in much Spanish American speech; this
       means a word like pan (bread) is often articulated ['paŋ]. To an
       English ear, those speakers that have a velar nasal for -n make pan
       sound like pang. Velarization of word-final /n/ is so spread in the
       Americas that it is easier to mention those regions that maintain
       an alveolar, Castilian-style, /n/: most of Mexico, Colombia (except
       for coastal dialects) and Argentina (except for some northern
       regions). Elsewhere, velarization is common, though alveolar /n/
       can appear among some educated speakers, especially in the media or
       in singing. Velar /-n/ is also frequent in Spain, especially in
       southern Spanish dialects (Andalusia and the Canary Islands) and
       also in the Northwest: Galicia, Asturias and León.

Lexical features[edit]

     * Anglicisms are far more common among Hispanic and Latino Americans
       (as is with Latin America) than in Spain, due to the stronger and
       more direct US influence in Latin America.

     * Equally, indigenous languages have left their mark on U.S. Spanish,
       a fact which is particularly evident in vocabulary to do with
       flora, fauna and cultural habits.

     * Disappearance of de which means "of" in certain expressions, as is
       the case with the dialect of Spanish in Canary Islands. Example:
       esposo Rosa instead of esposo de Rosa, gofio millo instead of gofio
       de millo, etc.

     * Doublets of Arabic-Latinate synonyms with the Arabic form are more
       common in U.S. Spanish being U.S. Spanish which derives from Latin
       American Spanish is influenced by Andalusian Spanish like
       Andalusian and Latin American alcoba for standard habitación or
       dormitorio ('bedroom') or alhaja for standard joya ('jewel').

Future of Spanish in the United States[edit]

   Spanish speaking US citizens are the fastest growing linguistic group
   in the United States. Continual immigration and prevalent
   Spanish-language mass media (such as Univisión, Telemundo, and Azteca
   América) support the Spanish-speaking populations. Moreover, because of
   the North American Free Trade Agreement, it is common for many American
   manufacturers to use multilingual product labeling using English,
   French and Spanish.

   Besides the businesses that always have catered to Hispanophone
   immigrants, a small, but increasing, number of mainstream American
   retailers now advertise bilingually in Spanish-speaking areas and offer
   bilingual, English-Spanish customer services. One common indicator of
   such businesses is Se Habla Español which means "Spanish is Spoken".
   Federal agencies such as the United States Postal Service translate
   information into Spanish.

   The State of the Union Addresses and other presidential speeches are
   translated to Spanish, following the precedent set by the Bill Clinton
   administration. Official Spanish translations are available at
   Whitehouse.gov. Moreover, non-Latin American origin politicians fluent
   in Spanish speak in Spanish to Hispanic majority constituencies. There
   are 500 Spanish newspapers, 152 magazines, and 205 publishers in the
   United States; magazine and local television advertising expenditures
   for the Hispanic market have increased much from 1999 to 2003, with
   growth of 58 percent and 43 percent, respectively.

   Historically, immigrants' languages tend to disappear or become reduced
   through generational assimilation. Spanish disappeared in several
   countries and U.S. territories during the 20th century, notably in the
   Pacific Island countries of Guam, Micronesia, Palau, the Northern
   Marianas islands, and the Marshall Islands.

   The English-only movement seeks to establish English as the sole
   official language of the United States. Generally, they exert political
   public pressure upon Hispanophone immigrants to learn English and speak
   it publicly; as universities, business, and the professions use
   English, there is much social pressure to learn English for upward
   socio-economic mobility.

   Generally, Latin American origin US residents (13.4% of the 2002
   population) are bilingual to a degree. A Simmons Market Research survey
   recorded that 19 percent of the U.S. Latin American origin population
   speak only Spanish, 9.0 percent speak only English, 55 percent have
   limited English proficiency, and 17 percent are fully English-Spanish
   bilingual.^[citation needed]

   Intergenerational transmission of Spanish is a more accurate indicator
   of Spanish's future in the United States than raw statistical numbers
   of Hispanophone immigrants. Although Latin American origin immigrants
   hold varying English proficiency levels, almost all second-generation
   Latin American origin US residents speak English, yet about 50 percent
   speak Spanish at home. Two-thirds of third-generation Mexican Americans
   speak only English at home.

   Calvin Veltman undertook, for the National Center for Education
   Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project, the most
   complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants.
   Mr Veltman's language shift studies document high bilingualism rates
   and subsequent adoption of English as the preferred language of
   Hispanics, particularly by the young and the native-born. The complete
   set of these studies' demographic projections postulates the
   near-complete assimilation of a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort
   within two generations. Although his study based itself upon a large
   1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census (which has not been
   repeated), data from the 1990 Census tend to confirm the great
   Anglicization of the U.S. Latin American origin population.

American literature in Spanish[edit]

   Southwest Colonial literature

   In 1610, Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá published his Historia de Nuevo
   México (History of New Mexico).

   19th century

   In 1880, José Martí moved to New York City.

   Eusebio Chacón published El hijo de la tempestad in 1892.

   20th century

   Federico García Lorca wrote his collection of poems, Poeta en Nueva
   York, and the two plays Así que pasen cinco años and El público while
   living in New York. Giannina Braschi wrote the Latino postmodern poetry
   classic El imperio de los sueños in Spanish in New York. José
   Vasconcelos and Juan Ramón Jiménez were both exiled to the United
   States.

   In her autobiography When I was Puerto Rican (1993), Esmeralda Santiago
   recounts her childhood on the island during the 1950s and her family's
   subsequent move to New York City, when she was 13 years old. Originally
   written in English, the book is an example of New York Rican
   literature.
