   Republicanism is a political values system that has been a major part
   of American civic thought since the American Revolution.^[1] It
   stresses liberty and "unalienable" rights as central values, makes the
   people as a whole sovereign, rejects aristocracy and inherited
   political power, expects citizens to be independent in their
   performance of civic duties, and vilifies corruption.^[2] American
   republicanism was founded and first practiced by the Founding Fathers
   in the 18th century. For them, according to one team of historians,
   "republicanism represented more than a particular form of government.
   It was a way of life, a core ideology, an uncompromising commitment to
   liberty, and a total rejection of aristocracy."^[3]

   Republicanism was based on Ancient Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and
   English models and ideas.^[4] It formed the basis for the American
   Revolution and the consequential Declaration of Independence (1776) and
   the Constitution (1787), as well as the Gettysburg Address (1863).^[5]

   Republicanism may be distinguished from other forms of democracy as it
   asserts that people have unalienable rights that cannot be voted away
   by a majority of voters.^[6] Alexis de Tocqueville warned about the
   "tyranny of the majority" in a democracy, and advocates of the rights
   of minorities have warned that the courts needed to protect those
   rights by reversing efforts by voters to terminate the rights of an
   unpopular minority.^[7]

   The term "republicanism" is derived from the term "republic", but the
   two words have different meanings. A "republic" is a form of government
   (one without a hereditary ruling class) while "republicanism" is a
   political ideology that can appear in republics or monarchies.^[8]

   Two major parties were explicitly named after the idea—the Republican
   party of Thomas Jefferson (founded in 1793, and often called the
   "Democratic-Republican Party" by political scientists), and the current
   Republican party, founded in 1854.^[9]
   The Capitol exalted classical republican virtues^[10]

The American Revolution[edit]

Republican virtues[edit]

   The colonial intellectual and political leaders in the 1760s and 1770s
   closely read history to compare governments and their effectiveness of
   rule.^[11] The Revolutionists were especially concerned with the
   history of liberty in England and were primarily influenced by the
   "country party" (which opposed the Court Party that held power).
   Country party relied heavily on the classical republicanism of Roman
   heritage; it celebrated the ideals of duty and virtuous citizenship in
   a republic. It drew heavily on ancient Greek city-state and Roman
   republican examples.^[12] The Country party shared some of the
   political philosophy of Whiggism as well as Tory critics in England
   which roundly denounced the corruption surrounding the "court" party in
   London centering on the royal court. This approach produced a political
   ideology Americans called "republicanism", which was widespread in
   America by 1775.^[13] "Republicanism was the distinctive political
   consciousness of the entire Revolutionary generation."^[14] J.G.A.
   Pocock explained the intellectual sources in America:^[15]
   “ The Whig canon and the neo-Harringtonians, John Milton, James
     Harrington and Sidney, Trenchard, Gordon and Bolingbroke, together with
     the Greek, Roman, and Renaissance masters of the tradition as far as
     Montesquieu, formed the authoritative literature of this culture; and
     its values and concepts were those with which we have grown familiar: a
     civic and patriot ideal in which the personality was founded in
     property, perfected in citizenship but perpetually threatened by
     corruption; government figuring paradoxically as the principal source
     of corruption and operating through such means as patronage, faction,
     standing armies (opposed to the ideal of the militia); established
     churches (opposed to the Puritan and deist modes of American religion);
     and the promotion of a monied interest—though the formulation of this
     last concept was somewhat hindered by the keen desire for readily
     available paper credit common in colonies of settlement.               ”

   Revolutionary Republicanism was centered on limiting corruption and
   greed. Virtue was of the utmost importance for citizens and
   representatives. Revolutionaries took a lesson from ancient Rome, they
   knew it was necessary to avoid the luxury that had destroyed the
   Empire.^[16] A virtuous citizen was one that ignored monetary
   compensation and made a commitment to resist and eradicate corruption.
   The Republic was sacred; therefore, it is necessary to serve the state
   in a truly representative way, ignoring self-interest and individual
   will. Republicanism required the service of those who were willing to
   give up their own interests for a common good. According to Bernard
   Bailyn "The preservation of liberty rested on the ability of the people
   to maintain effective checks on wielders of power and hence in the last
   analysis rested on the vigilance and moral stamina of the people...."
   Virtuous citizens needed to be strong defenders of liberty and
   challenge the corruption and greed in government. The duty of the
   virtuous citizen became a foundation for the American Revolution.^[17]

Cause of Revolution[edit]

   The commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their
   property rights helped bring about the American Revolution. Britain was
   increasingly being seen as corrupt and hostile and that of a threat to
   the very idea of democracy; a threat to the established liberties that
   Americans enjoyed and to American property rights.^[18] The greatest
   threat to liberty was thought by many to be corruption—not just in
   London but at home as well. The colonists associated it with luxury
   and, especially, inherited aristocracy, which they condemned. (A few
   Americans did gain English titles, but they moved to London.)

   Historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues that during the Revolution
   Christians linked their religion to republicanism. He states, "With the
   onset of the revolutionary crisis, a major conceptual shift convinced
   Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up
   America for some special purpose."^[19] Kidd further argues that " new
   blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious
   traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican
   virtue."^[20] As virtuous republicans, citizens had a growing moral
   obligation to eradicate the corruption they saw in the monarchy.^[21]

   Historian Gordon Wood has tied the founding ideas to American
   Exceptionalism."Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism,
   and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary
   era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a
   special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy."^[22]
   Americans were the protectors of liberty, they had a greater obligation
   and destiny to assert republican virtue. In Discourse of 1759 Jonathan
   Mayhew states "An absolute submission to our prince, or whether
   disobedience and resistance may not be justified able in some cases…to
   all those who bear the title of rulers in common but only to those who
   actually perform the duty of rulers by exercising a reasonable and just
   authority for the good of human society." The notion that British
   rulers were not virtuous, nor exercising their authority for the "good
   of human society" prompted the colonial desire to protect and
   reestablish republican values in government. This need to protect
   virtue was a philosophical underpinning of the American Revolution^[23]

Founding Fathers[edit]

   The "Founding Fathers" were strong advocates of republican values,
   especially Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas
   Paine, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison
   and Alexander Hamilton.^[24]

   Thomas Jefferson defined a republic as:
   “ ...a government by its citizens in mass, acting directly and
     personally, according to rules established by the majority; and that
     every other government is more or less republican, in proportion as it
     has in its composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct
     action of the citizens. Such a government is evidently restrained to
     very narrow limits of space and population. I doubt if it would be
     practicable beyond the extent of a New England township. The first
     shade from this pure element, which, like that of pure vital air,
     cannot sustain life of itself, would be where the powers of the
     government, being divided, should be exercised each by representatives
     chosen...for such short terms as should render secure the duty of
     expressing the will of their constituents. This I should consider as
     the nearest approach to a pure republic, which is practicable on a
     large scale of country or population ... we may say with truth and
     meaning, that governments are more or less republican as they have more
     or less of the element of popular election and control in their
     composition; and believing, as I do, that the mass of the citizens is
     the safest depository of their own rights, and especially, that the
     evils flowing from the duperies of the people, are less injurious than
     those from the egoism of their agents, I am a friend to that
     composition of government which has in it the most of this
     ingredient.^[25]                                                       ”

   The Founding Fathers discoursed endlessly on the meaning of
   "republicanism." John Adams in 1787 defined it as "a government, in
   which all men, rich and poor, magistrates and subjects, officers and
   people, masters and servants, the first citizen and the last, are
   equally subject to the laws."^[26]

Virtue vs. Commerce[edit]

   The open question, as Pocock suggested,^[27] of the conflict between
   personal economic interest (grounded in Lockean liberalism) and
   classical republicanism, troubled Americans. Jefferson and Madison
   roundly denounced the Federalists for creating a national bank as
   tending to corruption and monarchism; Alexander Hamilton staunchly
   defended his program, arguing that national economic strength was
   necessary for the protection of liberty. Jefferson never relented but
   by 1815 Madison switched and announced in favor of a national bank,
   which he set up in 1816.

   John Adams often pondered the issue of civic virtue. Writing Mercy Otis
   Warren in 1776, he agreed with the Greeks and the Romans, that, "Public
   Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only
   Foundation of Republics." Adams insisted, "There must be a positive
   Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honor, Power, and
   Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no
   Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion
   must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must
   pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures,
   Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest
   connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of
   society."^[28]

   Adams worried that a businessman might have financial interests that
   conflicted with republican duty; indeed, he was especially suspicious
   of banks. He decided that history taught that "the Spirit of Commerce
   ... is incompatible with that purity of Heart, and Greatness of soul
   which is necessary for a happy Republic." But so much of that spirit of
   commerce had infected America. In New England, Adams noted, "even the
   Farmers and Tradesmen are addicted to Commerce." As a result, there was
   "a great Danger that a Republican Government would be very factious and
   turbulent there."^[29]

Other influences[edit]

   A second stream of thought growing in significance was the classical
   liberalism of John Locke, including his theory of the "social
   contract". This had a great influence on the revolution as it implied
   the inborn right of the people to overthrow their leaders should those
   leaders betray the agreements implicit in the sovereign-follower
   relationship. Historians find little trace of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
   influence in America.^[30] In terms of writing state and national
   constitutions, the Americans used Montesquieu's analysis of the ideally
   "balanced" British Constitution. But first and last came a commitment
   to republicanism, as shown by many historians such as Bernard Bailyn
   and Gordon S. Wood.

Historiography[edit]

   For a century, historians have debated how important republicanism was
   to the Founding Fathers. The interpretation before 1960, following
   Progressive School historians such as Charles A. Beard, Vernon L.
   Parrington and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., downplayed rhetoric as
   superficial and looked for economic motivations. Louis Hartz refined
   the position in the 1950s, arguing John Locke was the most important
   source because his property-oriented liberalism supported the
   materialistic goals of Americans.^[31]

   In the 1960s and 1970s, two new schools emerged that emphasized the
   primacy of ideas as motivating forces in history (rather than material
   self-interest). Bernard Bailyn, Gordon Wood from Harvard formed the
   "Cambridge School"; at Washington University the "St. Louis School" was
   led by J.G.A. Pocock. They emphasized slightly different approaches to
   republicanism.^[32] However, some scholars, especially Isaac Kramnick,
   continue to emphasize Locke, arguing that Americans are fundamentally
   individualistic and not devoted to civic virtue. The relative
   importance of republicanism and liberalism remains a topic of strong
   debate among historians, as well as the politically active of present
   day.

New Nation: The Constitution[edit]

   The Founding Fathers wanted republicanism because its principles
   guaranteed liberty, with opposing, limited powers offsetting one
   another. They thought change should occur slowly, as many were afraid
   that a "democracy"- by which they meant a direct democracy- would allow
   a majority of voters at any time to trample rights and liberties. They
   believed the most formidable of these potential majorities was that of
   the poor against the rich.^[33] They thought democracy could take the
   form of mob rule that could be shaped on the spot by a demagogue.^[34]
   Therefore, they devised a written Constitution that could be amended
   only by a super majority, preserved competing sovereignties in the
   constituent states,^[35] gave the control of the upper house (Senate)
   to the states, and created an Electoral College, comprising a small
   number of elites, to select the president. They set up a House of
   Representatives to represent the people. In practice the electoral
   college soon gave way to control by political parties. In 1776, most
   states required property ownership to vote, but most citizens owned
   farms in the 90% rural nation, so it was not a severe restriction. As
   the country urbanized and people took on different work, the property
   ownership requirement was gradually dropped by many states. Property
   requirements were gradually dismantled in state after state, so that
   all had been eliminated by 1850, so that few if any economic barriers
   remained to prevent white adult males from voting.^[36]

"Republican" as party name[edit]

   In 1792–93 Jefferson and Madison created a new "republican party" in
   order to promote their version of the doctrine. They wanted to suggest
   that Hamilton's version was illegitimate.^[37] According to Federalist
   Noah Webster, a political activist bitter at the defeat of the
   Federalist party in the White House and Congress, the choice of the
   name "Republican" was "a powerful instrument in the process of making
   proselytes to the party.... The influence of names on the mass of
   mankind, was never more distinctly exhibited, than in the increase of
   the democratic party in the United States. The popularity of the
   denomination of the Republican Party, was more than a match for the
   popularity of Washington's character and services, and contributed to
   overthrow his administration."^[38] The party, which historians later
   called the Democratic-Republican Party, split into separate factions in
   the 1820s, one of which became the Democratic Party. After 1832, the
   Democrats were opposed by another faction that named themselves "Whigs"
   after the Patriots of the 1770s who started the American Revolution.
   Both of these parties proclaimed their devotion to republicanism in the
   era of the Second Party System.

Republican motherhood[edit]

   Under the new government after the Revolution, "republican motherhood"
   became an ideal, as exemplified by Abigail Adams and Mercy Otis Warren.
   The first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values
   in her children, and to avoid luxury and ostentation.^[39]

   Two generations later, the daughters and granddaughters of these
   "Republican mothers" appropriated republican values into their lives as
   they sought independence and equality in the workforce. During the
   1830s, thousands of women mill workers went on strike to battle for
   their right to fair wages and independence, as there had been major pay
   cuts. Many of these women were daughters of independent land owners and
   descendants of men who had fought in the Revolutionary War; they
   identified as "daughters of freemen". In their fight for independence
   at the mills, women would incorporate rhetoric from the Revolution to
   convey the importance and strength of their purpose to their corporate
   employers, as well as to other women. If the Revolutionary War was
   fought to secure independence from Great Britain, then these "daughters
   of freemen" could fight for the same republican values that (through
   striking) would give them fair pay and independence, just as the men
   had.^[40]

National debt[edit]

   Jefferson and Albert Gallatin focused on the danger that the public
   debt, unless it was paid off, would be a threat to republican values.
   They were appalled that Hamilton was increasing the national debt and
   using it to solidify his Federalist base. Gallatin was the Republican
   Party's chief expert on fiscal issues and as Treasury Secretary under
   Jefferson and Madison worked hard to lower taxes and lower the debt,
   while at the same time paying cash for the Louisiana Purchase and
   funding the War of 1812. Burrows says of Gallatin:

          His own fears of personal dependency and his small-shopkeeper's
          sense of integrity, both reinforced by a strain of radical
          republican thought that originated in England a century earlier,
          convinced him that public debts were a nursery of multiple
          public evils--corruption, legislative impotence, executive
          tyranny, social inequality, financial speculation, and personal
          indolence. Not only was it necessary to extinguish the existing
          debt as rapidly as possible, he argued, but Congress would have
          to ensure against the accumulation of future debts by more
          diligently supervising government expenditures.^[41]

   Andrew Jackson believed the national debt was a "national curse" and he
   took special pride in paying off the entire national debt in 1835.^[42]
   Politicians ever since have used the issue of a high national debt to
   denounce the other party for profligacy and a threat to fiscal
   soundness and the nation's future.^[43]

Democracy[edit]

   Ellis and Nelson argue that much constitutional thought, from Madison
   to Lincoln and beyond, has focused on "the problem of majority
   tyranny." They conclude, "The principles of republican government
   embedded in the Constitution represent an effort by the framers to
   ensure that the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of
   happiness would not be trampled by majorities."^[44] Madison, in
   particular, worried that a small localized majority might threaten
   inalienable rights, and in "Federalist #10" he argued that the larger
   the population of the republic, the more diverse it would be and the
   less liable to this threat.^[45] Jefferson warned that "an elective
   despotism is not the government we fought for."^[46]

   As late as 1800, the word "democrat" was mostly used to attack an
   opponent of the Federalist party. Thus, George Washington in 1798
   complained, "that you could as soon scrub the blackamoor white, as to
   change the principles of a profest Democrat; and that he will leave
   nothing unattempted to overturn the Government of this Country."^[47]
   The Federalist Papers are pervaded by the idea that pure democracy is
   actually quite dangerous, because it allows a majority to infringe upon
   the rights of a minority.^[48] Thus, in encouraging the states to
   participate in a strong centralized government under a new constitution
   and replace the relatively weak Articles of Confederation, Madison
   argued in Federalist No. 10 that a special interest may take control of
   a small area, e.g. a state, but it could not easily take over a large
   nation. Therefore, the larger the nation, the safer is
   republicanism.^[49]

   By 1805, the "Old Republicans" or "Quids", a minority faction among
   Southern Republicans, led by Johan Randolph, John Taylor of Caroline
   and Nathaniel Macon, opposed Jefferson and Madison on the grounds that
   they had abandoned the true republican commitment to a weak central
   government.^[50]

Property rights[edit]

   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story (1779–1845), made the protection of
   property rights by the courts a major component of American
   republicanism. A precocious legal scholar, Story was appointed to the
   Court by James Madison in 1811. He and Chief Justice John Marshall made
   the Court a bastion of nationalism (along the lines of Marshall's
   Federalist Party) and a protector of the rights of property against
   runaway democracy. Story opposed Jacksonian democracy because it was
   inclined to repudiate lawful debts and was too often guilty of what he
   called "oppression" of property rights by republican governments.^[51]
   Story held that, "the right of the citizens to the free enjoyment of
   their property legally acquired" was "a great and fundamental principle
   of a republican government."^[52] Newmyer (1985) presents Story as a
   "Statesman of the Old Republic" who tried to rise above democratic
   politics and to shape the law in accordance with the republicanism of
   Story's heroes, Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall, as well as the
   New England Whigs of the 1820s and 1830s, such as Daniel Webster.^[53]
   Historians agree that Justice Story—as much or more than Marshall or
   anyone else—did indeed reshape American law in a conservative direction
   that protected property rights.^[54]

Military service[edit]

   Civic virtue required men to put civic goals ahead of their personal
   desires, and to volunteer to fight for their country. As John Randolph
   of Roanoke put it, "When citizen and soldier shall be synonymous terms,
   then you will be safe."^[55] Scott (1984) notes that in both the
   American and French revolutions, distrust of foreign mercenaries led to
   the concept of a national, citizen army, and the definition of military
   service was changed from a choice of careers to a civic duty.^[56]
   Herrera (2001) explains that an appreciation of self-governance is
   essential to any understanding of the American military character
   before the Civil War. Military service was considered an important
   demonstration of patriotism and an essential component of citizenship.
   To soldiers, military service was a voluntary, negotiated, and
   temporary abeyance of self-governance by which they signaled their
   responsibility as citizens. In practice self-governance in military
   affairs came to include personal independence, enlistment negotiations,
   petitions to superior officials, militia constitutions, and
   negotiations regarding discipline. Together these affected all aspects
   of military order, discipline, and life.^[57]

Civil War and Reconstruction[edit]

   Historian Frank Lawrence Owsley depicted antebellum Southern society as
   a broad class of yeoman farmers who stood and worked between the slaves
   and poor whites at one end and the large planters at the opposite end
   of the economic spectrum, Owsley asserted that the real South was
   liberal, American, and Jeffersonian, not radical or reactionary. It
   reflected the best of republican principles (though Owsley did not use
   the word "republicanism" but his followers did)^[58] Agrarianism in the
   20th century was a response to the industrialism and modernism that had
   infiltrated the South. According to Owsley, the position of the South
   vis-à-vis the North was created not by slavery, cotton, or states'
   rights, but by the two regions' misunderstanding of each other.^[59] J.
   Mills Thornton argues that in the antebellum South the drive to
   preserve republican values was the most powerful force, and led
   Southerners to interpret Northern policies as a threat to their
   republican values.^[60]

   In reaction to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, antislavery forces in
   the North formed a new party. The party officially designated itself
   "Republican" because the name resonated with the struggle of 1776. "In
   view of the necessity of battling for the first principles of
   republican government," resolved the Michigan state convention, "and
   against the schemes of aristocracy the most revolting and oppressive
   with which the earth was ever cursed, or man debased, we will
   co-operate and be known as Republicans."^[61]^[62]

   After the war, the Republicans believed that an important aspect of
   securing citizenship for freedmen was to give them the franchise; that
   the true political education was to be gained in exercising the right
   to vote and organizing for political purposes. At the time, only men
   were allowed to vote. Constitutional amendments were passed granting
   citizenship to freedmen and the franchise to men.

Progressive Era[edit]

   A central theme of the Progressive era was fear of corruption, one of
   the core ideas of republicanism since the 1770s. The Progressives
   restructured the political system to combat entrenched interests (for
   example, through the direct election of Senators), to ban influences
   such as alcohol that were viewed as corrupting, and to extend the vote
   to women, who were seen as being morally pure and less
   corruptible.^[63]

   Questions of performing civic duty were brought up in presidential
   campaigns and World War I. In the presidential election of 1888,
   Republicans emphasized that the Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland
   had purchased a substitute to fight for him in the Civil War, while his
   opponent General Benjamin Harrison had fought in numerous battles.^[64]
   In 1917, a great debate took place over Woodrow Wilson's proposal to
   draft men into the U.S. Army after war broke out in Europe. Many said
   it violated the republican notion of freely given civic duty to force
   people to serve.^[65] In the end, Wilson was successful and the
   Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed.

New Deal Era to present[edit]

   The New Deal era broadened the scope of republicanism. Feldman says
   that President Franklin D. Roosevelt, "would not ignore poor or
   unemployed laborers. The ... concept of civic virtue no longer
   justified protecting old-stock Protestant values and interests while
   disregarding those of workers, indigents, and immigrants."^[66]

   Republicanism, especially in the sense of civic duty and equality of
   sacrifice, was a major theme in World War II. Lee reports that, "Long
   after the war, the generations who had lived through it would wax
   nostalgic about their equality of sacrifice and of suffering, and about
   the resurgence of a sense of civic duty and community
   participation."^[67]

   "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your
   country!" demanded President John F. Kennedy in 1961 in a dramatic call
   for the American people to honor the core republican value of civic
   duty.^[68]

   Military service in Vietnam became a test of civic duty for political
   candidates.^[69] In the presidential election of 2004, one of the chief
   topics of discussion was whether the candidates John Kerry and George
   W. Bush had fulfilled their civic duty of fighting for their country,
   part of the republican duties.^[70] Opponents charged that Bush had
   shirked his National Guard duties. Kerry won public approval when he
   heavily emphasized his Vietnam service,^[71] while his opponents, most
   famously the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, alleged that Kerry did not
   truly earn the medals he was awarded in Vietnam.^[72]

Legal terminology[edit]

   The term republic does not appear in the Declaration of Independence,
   but does appear in Article IV of the Constitution which "guarantee[s]
   to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government." What
   exactly the writers of the constitution felt this should mean is
   uncertain. The Supreme Court, in Luther v. Borden (1849), declared that
   the definition of republic was a "political question" in which it would
   not intervene. During Reconstruction the Constitutional clause was the
   legal foundation for the extensive Congressional control over the
   eleven former Confederate states; there was no such oversight over the
   border slave states that had remained in the Union.^[73]

   In two later cases, it did establish a basic definition. In United
   States v. Cruikshank (1875), the court ruled that the "equal rights of
   citizens" were inherent to the idea of republic. The opinion of the
   court from In re Duncan (1891)^[74] held that the "right of the people
   to choose their government" is also part of the definition. It is also
   generally assumed that the clause prevents any state from being a
   monarchy — or a dictatorship. Due to the 1875 and 1891 court decisions
   establishing basic definition, in the first version (1892) of the
   Pledge of Allegiance, which included the word republic, and like
   Article IV which refers to a Republican form of government, the basic
   definition of republic is implied and continues to do so in all
   subsequent versions, including the present edition, by virtue of its
   consistent inclusion.^[citation needed]

Democracy[edit]

   In March 1861 in his famous First Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln
   denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to
   be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system:

          "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and
          limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes
          of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign
          of a free people."^[75]

   Over time, the pejorative connotations of "democracy" faded. By the
   1830s, democracy was seen as an unmitigated positive and the term
   "Democratic" was assumed by the Democratic Party and the term
   "Democrat" was adopted by its members.^[76] A common term for the party
   in the 19th century was "The Democracy."^[77] In debates on
   Reconstruction, Radical Republicans, such as Senator Charles Sumner,
   argued that the republican "guarantee clause" in Article IV supported
   the introduction by force of law of democratic suffrage in the defeated
   South.^[78]

   After 1800 the limitations on democracy were systematically removed;
   property qualifications for state voters were largely eliminated in the
   1820s.^[79] The initiative, referendum, recall, and other devices of
   direct democracy became widely accepted at the state and local level in
   the 1910s; and senators were made directly electable by the people in
   1913. The last restrictions on black voting were made illegal in 1965.
