   Process-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that separates
   the concerns of data structures and the concurrent processes that act
   upon them. The data structures in this case are typically persistent,
   complex, and large scale - the subject of general purpose applications,
   as opposed to specialized processing of specialized data sets seen in
   high productivity applications (HPC). The model allows the creation of
   large scale applications that partially share common data sets.
   Programs are functionally decomposed into parallel processes that
   create and act upon logically shared data.

   The paradigm was originally invented for parallel computers in the
   1980s, especially computers built with transputer microprocessors by
   INMOS, or similar architectures. It evolved to meet deficiencies in the
   message passing paradigm of Occam^[citation needed] and enable uniform
   efficiency when porting applications between distributed memory and
   shared memory parallel computers.

   The first example of the paradigm appears in the programming language
   Ease designed at Yale University^[1]^[2] in 1990. Similar models have
   appeared since in the loose combination of SQL databases and objected
   oriented languages such as Java, often referred to as object-relational
   models and widely used in large scale distributed systems today. The
   paradigm is likely to appear on desktop computers as microprocessors
   increase the number of processors (multicore) per chip.
