   Homeless American

   Homelessness in the United States is an area of concern for social
   service providers, government officials, policy professionals, and
   society at large.^[1] The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
   Development in January 2012 annual point-in-time count found that
   633,782 people across America were homeless. With 2007 as a benchmark,
   the data from the report showed a 6.8 percent decline in homelessness
   among individuals, a 3.7 percent decline of homeless families, a 13.1
   percent decline of the unsheltered homeless population, and a 19.3
   percent decline in persons experiencing chronic homelessness. During
   the overall count, 62,619 veterans were found homeless nationwide.^[2]
   One out of 50 children or 1.5 million children in America will be
   homeless each year.^[3] There were an estimated 57,849 homeless
   veterans estimated in the United States during January 2013; or 12
   percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S.
   veterans are female. Texas, California and Florida have the highest
   numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth under the age of 18; comprising
   58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population ^[4] Because of
   turnover in the homeless population, the total number of people who
   experience homelessness for at least a few nights during the course of
   a year is thought to be considerably higher than point-in-time counts.
   A 2000 study estimated the number of such people to be between 2.3
   million and 3.5 million.^[5]^[6] According to Amnesty International
   USA, vacant houses outnumber homeless people by five times.^[7]

Overview[edit]

   According to the United States Conference of Mayors, in 2008 the three
   most commonly cited causes of homelessness for persons and families
   were a lack of affordable housing, cited by 72 percent, poverty (52%),
   and unemployment (44%).^[8]^:19 The suggestions to alleviate
   homelessness included providing more housing for persons with
   disabilities (72%), creating more employment opportunities (68%), and
   building more assisted housing units (64%).^[8]^:20

   Over the past decades, the availability and quality of data on
   homelessness has improved considerably, due, in part, to initiatives by
   the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the US
   Department of Health and Human Services, the US Department of Veterans
   Affairs, and several nongovernmental organizations working with
   homeless populations. Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and
   Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report,
   which revealed the number of individuals and families that were
   homeless, both sheltered and unsheltered. It standardized the data
   collection processes and created more opportunities for government
   officials and service providers to remedy the problem of homelessness
   in the United States.^[9]

Who are the Homeless[edit]

   According to the Stewart B. McKinney Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11301, et seq.
   (1994),^[10] a person is considered homeless if he or she "lacks a
   fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and ... has a primary
   nighttime residency that is: (A) a supervised publicly or privately
   operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations...
   (B) an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals
   intended to be institutionalized, or (C) a public or private place not
   designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation
   for human beings." Human Rights Watch (2010) identified emancipated
   teenagers in California as a new homeless population.

   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 5th Annual
   Homeless Assessment Report to Congress ^[11] estimated that 1.56
   million people, or one in every 200 Americans, experienced homelessness
   and found shelter between Oct. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2009 (p. iii). On
   a single night in January 2009, 643,000 people were homeless. Nearly
   two-thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or transitional housing
   program and the other third were living on the street, in an abandoned
   building, or another place not meant for human habitation (p. 19). A
   typical sheltered homeless person is a single, middle-aged man and a
   member of a minority group. Of all those who sought emergency shelter
   or transitional housing during 2009, the following characteristics were
   observed:

   • 78 percent of all sheltered homeless persons are adults.

   • 61 percent are male.

   • 62 percent are members of a minority group.

   • 38 percent are 31-to-50 years old.

   • 64 percent are in one-person households.

   • 38 percent have a disability.

   The United States government acknowledges four categories of people who
   qualify as legally homeless: (1) those who are currently homeless, (2)
   those who will become homeless in the imminent future, (3) certain
   youths and families with children who suffer from home instability
   caused by a hardship, and (4) those who suffer from home instability
   caused by domestic violence.^[12]
    1. CURRENT HOMELESSNESS: An individual or family who lacks a fixed,
       regular, and adequate nighttime residence, meaning any of the
       following three (3) situations:
          + Homeless Without Shelter: The individual or family uses a
            primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place
            not designed for—or ordinarily used as—a regular sleeping
            accommodation for human beings (e.g., car, park, abandoned
            building, bus or train station, airport, camping ground).
          + Homeless With Shelter: The individual or family lives in a
            supervised, publicly or privately operated shelter designated
            to provide temporary living arrangements (e.g., congregate
            shelters, transitional housing, hotels and motels paid for by
            charitable organizations or by federal, state, or local
            government programs for low-income individuals).
          + Homeless Due to Institutional Release: The individual is
            exiting an institution where he or she resided for no more
            than 90 days, and the individual resided in an emergency
            shelter or place not meant for human habitation immediately
            before entering that institution.
    2. IMMINENT HOMELESSNESS: An individual or family who will imminently
       lose their primary nighttime residence, meaning that each of the
       following three (3) conditions are met:
          + Imminence of Loss: The primary nighttime residence will be
            lost within 14 days.
          + Lack of Alternate Housing: The individual or family has not
            arranged for a new primary nighttime residence after the
            current residence is lost.
          + Lack of Support: The individual or family lacks the resources
            or support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing
            (e.g., family, friends, faith-based or other social networks).
    3. YOUTH/FAMILY HOME INSTABILITY CAUSED BY HARDSHIP: An unaccompanied
       youth under 25 years of age, or family with children, who is not
       currently or imminently lacking a primary nighttime residence, but
       who nevertheless suffers from unreliable housing. To qualify as
       homeless under this category, the youth or family must meet each of
       the following four (4) conditions:
          + Qualification as Homeless Youth or Family: must meet one of
            the definitions of homeless under any of the following seven
            (7) federal statutes:
              1. Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, §5732a(3)^[13]
              2. Head Start Act, §9832(11)^[14]
              3. Violence Against Women Act, §14043e-2(6)^[15]
              4. Public Health Service Act, §254b(h)(5)(A)^[16]
              5. Food and Nutrition Act, §2012(m)^[17]
              6. Child Nutrition Act, §1786(b)(15)^[18]
              7. McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, §11434a(2)^[19]
          + Lack of Permanent Housing: must have not had a lease,
            ownership interest, or occupancy agreement in permanent
            housing at any time during the last 60 days.
          + Persistence of Housing Instability: must have moved primary
            nighttime residences at least twice during the last 60 days.
          + Presence of an Ongoing Hardship: the lack of permanent housing
            and persistence of housing instability are expected to
            continue for an extended period of time due to any of the
            following six (6) reasons:
              1. Chronic disabilities
              2. Chronic physical or mental health conditions
              3. Substance addiction
              4. Histories of domestic violence or child abuse (including
                 neglect)
              5. The presence of a child or youth with a disability
              6. The presence of at least two (2) barriers to employment,
                 which include any of the following five (5) barriers:
                    # Lack of a high school diploma or GED
                    # Illiteracy
                    # Low English proficiency
                    # History of incarceration or detention for criminal
                      activity
                    # History of unstable employment.
    4. HOME INSTABILITY CAUSED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: Any individual or
       family who meets each of the following four (4) conditions:
          + Flight from Violence: The individual or family is fleeing or
            attempting to flee from violence, which includes any of the
            following:

              2. Dating violence
              3. Sexual assault
              4. Stalking
              5. Any other dangerous or life-threatening condition that
                 relates to violence against the individual or a family
                 member (including a child).
          + Connection with Housing: The violence or dangerous condition
            has either:
               o taken place within the individual’s or family’s primary
                 nighttime residence, or
               o made the individual or family afraid to return to their
                 primary nighttime residence.
          + Lack of Alternate Housing: The individual or family has no
            other residence to flee to.
          + Lack of Support: The individual or family lacks the resources
            or support networks to obtain other permanent housing (e.g.,
            family, friends, faith-based or other social networks).^[20]

Causes[edit]

   Juxtaposition of homeless and well off is common on Broadway, New York
   City.

   "In 2004 the United States Conference of Mayors... surveyed the mayors
   of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness and most
   of the mayors named the lack of affordable housing as a cause of
   homelessness.... The next three causes identified by mayors, in rank
   order, were mental illness or the lack of needed services, substance
   abuse and lack of needed services, and low-paying jobs. The lowest
   ranking cause, cited by five mayors, was prisoner reentry. Other causes
   cited were unemployment, domestic violence, and poverty."

   The major causes of homelessness include:^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * The failure of urban housing projects to provide safe, secure, and
       affordable housing to the poor.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24] Additionally,
       many workers cannot afford to live where they work, and even in
       moderately priced communities housing costs require a large portion
       of household income.^[25]
     * The deinstitutionalization movement from the 1950s onwards in state
       mental health systems, to shift towards 'community-based' treatment
       of the mentally ill, as opposed to long-term commitment in
       institutions.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24] There is disproportionally higher
       prevalence of mental disorders relative to other disease groups
       within homeless patient populations at both inpatient hospitals and
       hospital-based emergency departments.^[26]
     * Redevelopment and gentrification activities instituted by cities
       across the country through which low-income neighborhoods are
       declared blighted and demolished to make way for projects that
       generate higher property taxes and other revenue, creating a
       shortage of housing affordable to low-income working families, the
       elderly poor, and the disabled.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * The failure of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide
       effective mental health care and meaningful job training for many
       homeless veterans, particularly those of the Vietnam War.^[27]
     * Deprived of normal childhoods, nearly half of foster children in
       the United States become homeless when they are released from
       foster care at age 18.^[28]^[29]
     * Natural disasters that destroy homes: hurricanes, floods,
       earthquakes, etc. Places of employment are often destroyed too,
       causing unemployment and transience.^[30]
     * People who have served time in prison, have abused drugs and
       alcohol, or have a history of mental illness find it difficult to
       impossible to find employment for years at a time because of the
       use of computer background checks by potential employers.^[31]
     * According to the Institution of Housing in 2005, the U.S.
       Government has focused 42% more on foreign countries rather than
       homeless Americans, including homeless
       veterans.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * People who are hiding in order to evade law
       enforcement.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * Adults and children who flee domestic violence.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * Teenagers who flee or are thrown out by parents who disapprove of
       their child's sexual orientation or gender identity. A 2010 study
       by the Center for American Progress shows that a disproportionately
       high number of homeless youth (between 20–40%) identify as
       LGBTQ.^[32]
     * Overly complex building code that makes it difficult for most
       people to build. Traditional huts, cars, and tents are illegal,
       classified as substandard and may be removed by government, even
       though the occupant may own the land. Land owner cannot live on the
       land cheaply, and so sells the land and becomes
       homeless.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * Foreclosures of homes, including foreclosure of apartment complexes
       which displaces tenants renting there.^[33]
     * Evictions from rented property.^[33]
     * Lack of support from friends or family.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]
     * Individuals who prefer homelessness and wish to remain off the grid
       for political and ideological purposes. Often self-identified as
       Gutter Punks or Urban Survivalists. The Department of Housing and
       Urban Development rarely reports on this counter-cultural movement
       since Gutter Punks and similar individuals often refuse to
       participate in governmental studies and do not seek governmental
       assistance for ideological or political purposes.^[34]
     * Lack of resources in place in the communities to help aid in
       prevention of homelessness before it becomes a
       crisis.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]

   According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the demand for emergency
   shelter in 270 U.S. cities increased 13% in 2001 and 25% in
   2005.^[21]^[22] 22 percent of those requesting emergency shelter were
   turned away. Traditionally single men have constituted the majority of
   the homeless. In the 1980s there was a sharp rise in the number of
   homeless families in certain parts of the United States; notably New
   York City.^[citation needed] Most homeless families consist of a single
   mother and children. A significant number of homeless people are
   teenagers and young adults, mostly runaways or street children. A 1960
   survey by Temple University of Philadelphia's poor neighborhoods found
   that 75% of the homeless were over 45 years old, and 87% were
   white.^[35] In 1986, 86% were under age 45, and 87% were minorities.

   According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2008
   Annual Homeless Assessment Report, the most common demographic features
   of all sheltered homeless people are: male, members of minority groups,
   older than age 31, and alone. More than two-fifths of sheltered
   homeless people have a disability. At the same time, sizable segments
   of the sheltered homeless population are white, non-Hispanic (38
   percent), children (20 percent), or part of multi-person households (33
   percent). Approximately 68 percent of the 1.6 million sheltered
   homeless people were homeless as individuals and 32 percent were
   persons in families.^[36]

   In 2008 more than two-thirds of all sheltered homeless people were
   located in principal cities, with 32 percent located in suburban or
   rural jurisdictions. About two-fifths of people entering an emergency
   shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another
   homeless situation (sheltered or unsheltered), two-fifths came from a
   housed situation (in their own or someone else's home), and the
   remaining one-fifth were split between institutional settings or other
   situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short
   lengths of stay in emergency shelters: three-fifths stayed less than a
   month, and a third stayed a week or less.^[36]

Efforts to Alleviate Homelessness[edit]

More affordable housing[edit]

   Homeless individuals report a lack of affordable housing as the number
   one reason for becoming homeless.^[37] This inadequacy must be remedied
   in order to get people off the streets and out of shelters. Many
   non-profit organizations are in operation to serve this need—for
   example, the National Low Income Housing Coalition—but most lack the
   funding necessary to create enough housing. Several proposed policy
   measures are designed to secure such funding, such as the National
   Housing Trust Fund, but these have not been signed into law.

Comprehensive health care[edit]

   Homeless individuals report mental illness as being the number three
   reason for becoming or staying homeless.^[37] Such illnesses are often
   closely linked with the fourth reason—substance abuse—and therefore it
   is generally accepted that both of these issues should be treated
   simultaneously. Although many medical, psychiatric, and counseling
   services exist to address these needs, it is commonly believed that
   without the support of reliable and stable housing such treatments
   remain ineffective. Furthermore, in the absence of a universal
   health-care plan, many of those in need cannot afford such services.
   Legislation such as the Bringing America Home Act, if enacted, would
   provide comprehensive and available treatment for all.

Homeless assistance programs[edit]

   The homeless community of the United States is aided in many ways from
   governmental and non-governmental organizations. Non-governmental
   organizations help the homeless by advocating or by physical and
   financial aid. Organizations like the National Alliance to End
   Homelessness go to government officials and offices to speak on behalf
   of the homeless community calling for policy changes or for the
   creation of policy to help end homelessness. Government agencies
   respond. The following programs and policies acknowledge the phenomenon
   of homelessness, provide help to the homeless, and prevent further
   growth of the homeless population.

   Programs

   Many programs that are designed to assist the homeless population have
   incorporated some type of housing program for their clients. Whether it
   is a transitional, permanent or even emergency housing program, the
   assistance is often provided for a very low cost and maybe even free.
   In the United States each year, there are around 3.5 million people who
   live their lives without shelter or a stable occupation. For 2006
   alone, $28.5 billion was allotted to homeless programs ran through HUD
   (Housing and Urban Development), $1 billion was given for Section 8
   housing, and $1.4 billion was used for Homeless Assistance Grants. As
   one example, Volunteers of America is an agency that believes
   preventing family homelessness is a critical part of their
   organization. Through them, transitional housing and emergency shelters
   are available to those who are in desperate need.

   Housing

   The two main types of housing programs provided for homeless people
   are:
     * Transitional

          Transitional housing programs are operated with one goal in mind
          – to help individuals and families obtain permanent housing as
          quickly as possible. Transitional housing programs assist
          homeless for a fixed amount of time or until they are able to
          obtain housing on their own and function successfully in the
          community, or whichever comes first.^[38]^[39]^[40]

     * Permanent

          For a significant number of homeless Americans with mental or
          physical impairments, often coupled with drug and/or alcohol use
          issues, long-term homelessness can only be ended by providing
          permanent housing coupled with intensive supportive services.
          Permanent housing provides a "base" for people to move out of
          poverty.

   Some shelters and associated charitable foundations have bought
   buildings and real estate to develop into permanent housing for the
   homeless in lieu of transitional Housing.^[41]

   The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and
   Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher
   program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or
   HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized
   housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed
   forces veterans.^[42] The HUD-VASH program has been successful in
   housing many homeless veterans.^[43]

   Substance abuse prevention

   Without supportive services, housing is not often enough to end
   homelessness. Various agencies, in fact all homeless prevention
   agencies and programs include substance abuse recovery and prevention
   programs. Objectives are to provide substance abuse counseling and
   access to treatment centers.

   Self-sufficiency

   For a significant number of homeless Americans with mental or physical
   impairments, often coupled with drug and/or alcohol use issues,
   long-term homelessness can only be ended by providing permanent housing
   coupled with intensive supportive services.

Policies[edit]

   There are several policies dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the
   government decided to start sending funding to the homeless, but it was
   not until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them.
   As it was shown though seventy percent required the homeless to attend
   a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there. In the
   1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge
   social problem. Later on, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (P.L.
   107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive
   McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from
   non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and
   safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary
   services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The Bush Administration
   established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten
   years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness
   began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general
   adopted by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) in 2000.
   The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment
   to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. In 2002,
   as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made "ending chronic
   homelessness in the next decade a top objective." The bi-partisan,
   congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report
   to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years
   among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council
   on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the
   President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken
   some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic
   homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration
   announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the
   needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The "Ending
   Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing"^[44] initiative
   was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD^[45] and the
   Department of Labor (DOL).^[46] The initiative offered $10 million from
   HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five
   communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8
   is the core housing program that helps extremely low-income families
   accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the
   median income for each community. The government assists homeless
   families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the
   families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found
   in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who
   receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the amount of
   vouchers granted to the homeless population.

   On May 20, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Homeless Emergency
   Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009. The
   HEARTH Act amends and reauthorizes the McKinney-Vento Homeless
   Assistance Act with substantial changes. The HEARTH Act of 2009
   consolidated HUD's competitive grant programs, created a Rural Housing
   Stability Program, changed HUD's definition of homelessness and chronic
   homelessness, supplied a simplified match requirement, increased
   prevention resources and increased in the emphasis on performance. The
   primary purpose of the legislation was to provide principal definitions
   regarding homelessness. The following terms: "homeless," "homeless
   individual," "homeless person," and "homeless individual with a
   disability."

Housing First[edit]

   Housing First has met with success since its initial implementations in
   2009 by providing relatively no strings-attached housing to homeless
   people with substance abuse problems or mental health issues. Housing
   First allows homeless men and women to be taken directly off the street
   into private community-based apartments, without requiring treatment
   first. This allows the homeless to return to some sense of normalcy,
   from which it is believed that they are better-poised to tackle their
   addictions or sicknesses. The relapse rate through these types of
   programs is lower than that of conventional homeless
   programs.^[47]^[48]

   Housing First was initiated by the federal government's Interagency
   Council on Homelessness. It asks cities to come up with a plan to end
   chronic homelessness under the assumption that if homeless people are
   given independent housing immediately with some social and financial
   support, then there will be reduced needs for emergency homeless
   shelters.^[49]^[50]

Paradigm shift[edit]

   A significant shift has occurred in homeless services over the past
   five years which has changed the emphasis from "managing the problem of
   homelessness" with emergency shelters, soup kitchens and health clinic
   to ending homelessness by housing individuals who are experiencing
   homelessness. In 2000, the National Alliance to End Homelessness^[51]
   released "A Plan, Not a Dream: How to End Homelessness in Ten Years"
   which encouraged communities to develop and implement 10-year plans to
   end homelessness in their communities.

   Key effective programs include:
     * Shelter Plus Care – a federal program that provides housing
       subsidies and are matched by local funds to provide long-term
       supportive services (typically case management). Experience
       demonstrated that many individuals who have been homeless for a
       significant time often lose their housing shortly after placement.
       The Shelter Plus Care program provides long-term supports including
       working with the landlord to keep the individual housed.

     * Housing First – a service paradigm that assumes that individuals
       who are homeless are "ready" to be housed immediately and with
       appropriate supports can retain their housing. The Pathways to
       Housing project in New York demonstrated a five-year housing
       retention rate of 88 percent among formerly homeless individuals
       with serious mental illness. Homeless people seeking help are often
       required to participate in substance abuse, mental health, and life
       skills programs of a year or more regardless of whether those are
       factors in their case. Many people only need decent housing to get
       back on their feet. Central City Concern's (Portland, Oregon)
       Shoreline Project allows homeless unemployed men to move into SRO
       type single person studios and find a job within 70 days; it's been
       a great success with expected expansion of the program in 2007.

     * Assertive Outreach – a form of engagement and outreach that
       emphasizes building a bond of trust between the case worker and the
       individual. Engagement is highly individualized with the pace
       dictated by the individual in need. Case workers do not force
       rules, regulations or program services until they are requested.
       Typically used to engage homeless, mentally ill individuals.

   In Boston, Massachusetts, in September 2007, an outreach to the
   homeless was initiated in the Boston Common, after some arrests and
   shootings, and in anticipation of the cold winter ahead. This outreach
   targets homeless people who would normally spend their sleeping time on
   the Boston Common, and tries to get them into housing, trying to skip
   the step of an emergency shelter. Applications for Boston Housing
   Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted. This is
   an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative, federally
   mandated. Boston's Mayor, Thomas Menino, was quoted as saying "The
   solution to homelessness is permanent housing". Still, this is a very
   controversial strategy, especially if the people are not able to
   sustain a house with proper community, health, substance counseling,
   and mental health supportive programs.^[52]

Homeless bills of rights legislation[edit]

   In June 2012, Governor Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island signed a bill
   into law which gives homeless people in that state some clearer rights
   than before.^[53]

Statistics and demographics[edit]

   Completely accurate and comprehensive statistics are difficult to
   acquire for any social study, but especially so when measuring the
   ambiguous hidden, and erratic reality of homelessness. All figures
   given are estimates. In addition, these estimates represent overall
   national averages; the proportions of specific homeless communities can
   vary substantially depending on local geography.^[54]

2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress[edit]

   Perhaps the most accurate, comprehensive, and current data on
   homelessness in the United States is reported annually by the
   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the Annual
   Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (AHAR), released in June of
   every year since 2007. The AHAR report relies on data from two sources:
   single-night, point-in-time counts of both sheltered and unsheltered
   homeless populations reported on the Continuum of Care applications to
   HUD; and counts of the sheltered homeless population over a full year
   provided by a sample of communities based on data in their Management
   Information Systems (HMIS).^[36]

Other statistics[edit]

   Homeless children in the United States.^[55] The number of homeless
   children reached record highs in 2011,^[56] 2012,^[57] and 2013^[58] at
   about three times their number in 1983.^[57]

   Some estimates from various sources on the characteristics and number
   of homeless people:

   Total Number

     * As many as 3.5 million people experience homelessness in a given
       year (1% of the entire U.S. population or 10% of its poor), and
       about 842,000 people in any given week.^[59]^[60] Most were
       homeless temporarily. The chronically homeless population (those
       with repeated episodes or who have been homeless for long periods)
       fell from 175,914 in 2005 to 123,833 in 2007.^[61]

   Familial composition^[62]

     * 23% are families with children—the fastest growing segment.
     * 51.3% are single males.
     * 24.7% are single females.
     * 5% are minors unaccompanied by adults.

   1.37 million (or 39%) of the total homeless population are children
   under the age of 18.^[62]

   Marital status^[62]

     * 24% are married.
     * 76% are single.
     * 67.5% are single males within the single percentage.
     * 32.5% are single females within the single percentage.

   Ethnicity^[62]

     * 42% are African American (over-represented 3.23x compared to 13% of
       general population).
     * 38% are Caucasian (under-represented 0.53x compared to 72% of
       general population).
     * 20% are Hispanic (over-represented 1.25x compared to 16% of general
       population).
     * 4% are Native American (over-represented 4x compared to 1% of
       general population).
     * 2% are Asian-American (under-represented 0.4x compared to 5% of
       general population).

   Health-concerns.^[59]

     * 39% report some form of mental health problems
     * 22% are considered to have serious mental illnesses, or are
       disabled.
     * 38% have alcohol abuse problems.
     * 26% have other substance abuse problems.
     * 3% report having HIV/AIDS.
     * 26% report acute health problems other than HIV/AIDS such as
       tuberculosis, pneumonia, or sexually transmitted infections.
     * 46% report chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure,
       diabetes, or cancer.
     * 55% report having no health insurance (compared to 27% of general
       population).
     * 58% report having trouble getting enough food to eat.

   Education^[63]

     * 38% have less than a High School diploma.
     * 34% have a High School diploma or equivalent (G.E.D.).
     * 28% have more than a High School education.

   Employment^[64]

     * 44% report having worked in the past week.
     * 13% have regular jobs.
     * 50% receive less than $300 per month as income.
     * 70% work on street corners, pan-handling or prostituting
       themselves.

   Additionally, a 2010 longitudinal study of homeless men conducted in
   Birmingham, Alabama found that most of them earned ninety dollars a
   week on average while working thirty hours a week on average.^[65]

   Location.^[59]

     * 71% reside in central cities.
     * 21% are in suburbs.
     * 9% are in rural areas.

   Duration^[66]

     * 80% of those who experience homelessness do so for less than 3
       weeks. They typically have more personal, social, or economic
       resources to draw upon.
     * 10% are homeless for up to two months. They cite lack of available
       or affordable housing as responsible for the delay.
     * 10% are so called "chronic" and remain without housing for extended
       periods of time on a frequent basis.

*This survey has omitted the percentage who are not chronically homeless but wer
e homeless for an average time such as a year or two.

Effects of Homelessness[edit]

   Education

   Homelessness has a tremendous effect on a child's education. Education
   of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the cycle of
   poverty.^[citation needed] The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act
   mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless
   students. This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless
   students have to receiving an education. These barriers include
   residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation
   issues. Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject
   to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because
   of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness,
   while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many
   report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students
   because it's the only thing that remains normal.^[67] Many homeless
   students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders,
   and lack of attendance in school.^[68]

   Since the housing market fall out there has been a rise in the number
   of homeless students. NAEHCY or the National Association for the
   Education of Homeless for Children and Youth, has reported a 99%
   increase in homeless students within a three-month period (San
   Diego).^[69]

   Of 1,636 schools, 330 reported no increase, 847 reported an increase of
   half, and 459 reported an increase of 25% or more. Due to the
   provisions of the McKinney-Vento Act many school districts are
   struggling to provide the necessary services, such as rising
   transportation needs and the greater severity of services.

     One of the biggest challenges our district faces is providing
     transportation to students who are experiencing homelessness. There
     are few approaches that our district can utilize to provide
     transportation for these students. Our city has only one taxi cab
     service and no public bus system. Our cab company is small and
     simply cannot fulfill all of our transportation requests. When it's
     possible, we add students to existing bus routes or set up a
     contractual agreement with the student's parent/guardian. However,
     there have been many situations where none of these options have
     worked. Another challenge our district faces is providing proper
     outer-wear for students who are homeless. Being that we live in
     central Wisconsin and have long, cold winters, all students need
     proper outerwear to go outside. Proper outerwear includes snow
     boots, hat, mittens, snow pants, and a winter jacket that has a
     working zipper or buttons on it. This expense adds up quickly and is
     hard to provide to the increasing number of homeless students.^[69]

   This is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1) 1.5 times
   more likely to perform below grade level in reading; 2)1.5 times more
   likely to perform below grade level in spelling; and 3) 2.5 times more
   likely to perform below grade level in math.^[69] There are a few
   worries that there will be false reports of homeless students, but
   mostly it's not an issue.^[67]

   Health

   There has been concern about the transmission of diseases in the
   homeless population housed in shelters, and the people who work there,
   especially with tuberculosis.^[70]

   A 2011 study led by Dr. Rebecca T. Brown in Boston, Massachusetts
   conducted by the Institute for Aging Research (an affiliate of Harvard
   Medical School), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the Boston
   Health Care for the Homeless Program found the elderly homeless
   population had "higher rates of geriatric syndromes, including
   functional decline, falls, frailty and depression, than seniors in the
   general population and that many of these conditions may be easily
   treated if detected". The report was published in the Journal of
   Geriatric Internal Medicine.^[71]

Public attitudes[edit]

   Many advocates for the homeless contend that a key difficulty is the
   social stigma surrounding homelessness. Many associate a lack of a
   permanent home with a lack of a proper bathroom and limited access to
   regular grooming. Thus, the homeless become “aesthetically unappealing”
   to the general public. Research shows that “physically attractive
   persons are judged more positively than physically unattractive
   individuals on various traits…reflecting social competence." ^[72] In
   addition to the physical component of stigmatization exists an
   association of the homeless with mental illness. Many people consider
   the mentally ill to be irresponsible and childlike and treat them with
   fear and exclusion, using their mental incapacitation as justification
   for why they should be left out of communities.^[73] There is anecdotal
   evidence that many Americans complain about the presence of homeless
   people, blame them for their situation, and feel that their requests
   for money or support (usually via begging) are unjustified. In the
   1990s, particularly, many observers and media articles spoke of
   "compassion fatigue" a belief that the public had grown weary of this
   seemingly intractable problem. A common misconception persists that
   many individuals who panhandle are not actually homeless, but actually
   use pity and compassion to fund their lifestyles, making up to $20 an
   hour and living luxurious lives.^[74] This exception to the rule seems
   more prevalent due to media attention, but in reality, only a few cases
   exist.^[75] Public opinion surveys show relatively little support for
   this view, however. A 1995 paper in the American Journal of Community
   Psychology concluded that "although the homeless are clearly
   stigmatized, there is little evidence to suggest that the public has
   lost compassion and is unwilling to support policies to help homeless
   people."^[76] A Penn State study in 2004 concluded that "familiarity
   breeds sympathy" and greater support for addressing the problem.^[77]

   A 2007 survey conducted by Public Agenda, a nonprofit organization that
   helps leaders and their citizens navigate through complex social
   issues, found that 67 percent of New Yorkers agreed that most homeless
   people were without shelter because of "circumstances beyond their
   control," including high housing costs and lack of good and steady
   employment. More than one-third (36 percent) said they worried about
   becoming homeless themselves, with 15 percent saying they were "very
   worried." More interestingly, 90 percent of New Yorkers believed that
   everyone has a right to shelter, and 68 percent believed that the
   government is responsible for guaranteeing that right to its citizens.
   The survey found support for investments in prevention, rental
   assistance and permanent housing for the homeless.^[78]

   Public Agenda has also concluded, however, that the public's sympathy
   has limits. In a 2002 national survey, the organization found 74
   percent say the police should leave a homeless person alone if he or
   she is not bothering anyone. Yet , contradictingly, 71 percent say the
   police should move the homeless if they are keeping customers away from
   a shopping area and 51 percent say the homeless should be moved if they
   are driving other people away from a public park.^[79]

Criminalization of homelessness[edit]

   Various laws have both directly and indirectly criminalized the
   homeless^[80] and people attempting to feed homeless people
   outdoors.^[81]

   In 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Committee criticized the
   United States for the criminalization of homelessness, noting that such
   "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment" is in violation of
   international human rights treaty obligations.^[82]^[83]^[84]^[85]

Vagrancy[edit]

   Measures passed "prohibit activities such as sleeping/camping, eating,
   sitting, and begging in public spaces, usually including criminal
   penalties for violation of these laws."^[86] Violators of such laws
   typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines and/or
   incarceration.

   In April 2006 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that
   "making it a crime to be homeless by charging them with a crime is in
   violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments."^[87]^[88] However, on
   October 15, 2007, the Court vacated its Opinion when, on appeal the
   parties settled the case out of court.^[89]

     The City could not expressly criminalize the status of homelessness
     by making it a crime to be homeless without violating the Eighth
     Amendment, nor can it criminalize acts that are an integral aspect
     of that status. Because there is substantial and undisputed evidence
     that the number of homeless persons in Los Angeles far exceeds the
     number of available shelter beds at all times, including on the
     nights of their arrest or citation, Los Angeles has encroached upon
     Appellants' Eighth Amendment protections by criminalizing the
     unavoidable act of sitting, lying or sleeping at night while being
     involuntarily homeless.

     … the Eighth Amendment prohibits the City from punishing involuntary
     sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks that is an
     unavoidable consequence of being human and homeless without shelter
     in the City of Los Angeles.

     … By our decision, we in no way dictate to the City that it must
     provide sufficient shelter for the homeless, or allow anyone who
     wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on the streets of Los Angeles at any
     time and at any place within the City. All we hold is that, so long
     as there is a greater number of homeless individuals in Los Angeles
     than the number of available beds, the City may not enforce section
     41.18(d) at all times and places throughout the City against
     homeless individuals for involuntarily sitting, lying, and sleeping
     in public.

   In August 2007, in Boston, Massachusetts, the city took action to keep
   loiterers, including the homeless, off the Boston Common overnight,
   after a series of violent crimes and drug arrests.^[90]

   In August 2012, a federal district judge in Philadelphia ruled that
   laws prohibiting serving food to the homeless outdoors were
   unconstitutional.^[91]

   On June 19, 2014 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down
   a 1983 ordinance in the city of Los Angeles which "bans people from
   living in cars or recreational vehicles on city streets or in parking
   lots" as being "unconstitutionally vague ... Unlike other cities, which
   ban overnight parking or sleeping in vehicles, Los Angeles' law
   prohibits using cars as 'living quarters; both overnight and
   'day-by-day, or otherwise.'"^[92]

Crimes against homeless people[edit]

   The past two decades have seen a growing number of violent acts
   committed upon people experiencing homelessness—the rate of such
   documented crimes in 2005 was 30% higher than of those in 1999.^[86]
   75% of all perpetrators are under the age of 25.

   In recent years, largely due to the efforts of the National Coalition
   for the Homeless (NCH) and academic researchers, the problem of
   violence against the homeless has gained national attention. In their
   report: Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA, the NCH reported
   386 violent acts committed against homeless persons over the period,
   among which 155 were lethal. The NCH called those acts hate crimes
   (they retain the definition of the American Congress). They insist that
   so called bumfight videos disseminate hate against the homeless and
   dehumanize them.

   The Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism (CSHE) at California State
   University, San Bernardino in conjunction with the NCH found that 155
   homeless people were killed by non-homeless people in "hate killings",
   while 76 people were killed in all the other traditional hate crime
   homicide categories such as race and religion, combined.^[93] The CSHE
   contends that negative and degrading portrayals of the homeless
   contribute to a climate where violence takes place.

   Various studies and surveys indicate that homeless people have a much
   higher criminal victimization rate than the non-homeless, but that most
   incidents never get reported to authorities. A 2007 study found that
   the number of violent crimes against the homeless is
   increasing.^[93]^[94] In 2013 there were 109 attacks on homeless
   people, a 24 per cent increase on the previous year, according to the
   NCH. Eighteen people died as a result of the attacks. In July 2014
   three boys 15, 16 and 18, were arrested and charged with beating to
   death two homeless men with bricks and a metal pole in
   Albuquerque.^[95]

Historical background[edit]

Pre-1960s[edit]

   Many towns and cities had an area which contained the poor, transients,
   and afflicted, such as a "skid row". In New York City, for example,
   there was an area known as "the Bowery", traditionally, where
   alcoholics were to be found sleeping on the streets, bottle in hand.
   Rescue missions offering "soup, soap, and salvation", a phrase
   introduced by The Salvation Army,^[96] sprang up along the Bowery
   thoroughfare, including the oldest one, The Bowery Mission. The mission
   was founded in 1879 by the Rev. and Mrs. A.G. Ruliffson.^[97]
   The Bowery Mission at 36 Bowery in New York City in the 1880s

   The mission's parent organization, Christian Herald, once published
   "Christian Herald And Signs of Our Times". In relating the formation
   and origin of the mission in its March 27, 1895 edition it said:
   "Fifteen years ago, Rev. A.G. Ruliffson and Mrs. Ruliffson, long
   engaged in mission work in New York, decided to open an eastside
   mission for men."

   At the time the Bowery Mission was established it was located at 36
   Bowery, a location that in an earlier time in New York City, played a
   role in the New York City Draft Riots, when the building was used as a
   saloon. An examination of the Annual Reports for the first decade of
   the mission, and period New York City newspapers starting in 1881,
   suggest that an 1880 date for the mission is more likely than 1879. To
   cite examples from period newspapers, The New York Tribune's article,
   "The Bowery Mission, A Sketch of its Career", dated March 14, 1898
   opens with "The Bowery Mission was started in 1880 at No.36 Bowery by a
   number of men who were interested in mission work." An even earlier
   article appearing in The New York Tribune on November 8, 1880, "A
   Bright Spot In The Darkness", declared "The Bowery Evangelical Mission,
   at No.36 Bowery, was opened yesterday afternoon with a prayer-meeting,
   at which some 150 persons were present." The present location of the
   Bowery Mission at 227–229 Bowery dates to 1909 when an abandoned coffin
   factory was converted to a mission.

   In smaller towns, there were hobos, who temporarily lived near train
   tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations. Especially
   following the American Civil War, a large number of homeless men formed
   part of a counterculture known as "hobohemia" all over
   America.^[98]^[99]

   Jacob Riis wrote about, documented, and photographed the poor and
   destitute, although not specifically the homeless, in New York City
   tenements in the late 19th century. His ground-breaking book, How the
   Other Half Lives, published in 1890, raised public awareness of living
   conditions in the slums, causing some changes in building codes and
   some social conditions.

   In the 1930s, the Great Depression caused the return of the homeless.
   There were two million homeless people migrating around the country.
   One visible effect of the depression was the advent of Hoovervilles.
   Residents lived in shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens.
   Authorities did not officially recognize these Hoovervilles and
   occasionally removed the occupants for technically trespassing on
   private lands, but they were frequently tolerated out of necessity.

1960s and 1970s[edit]

   In the United States, during the late 1970s, the deinstitutionalization
   of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor
   which seeded the homeless population, especially in urban areas such as
   New York City.^[100]

   The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a pre-disposing factor in
   setting the stage for homelessness in the United States.^[101] Long
   term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into
   Single Room Occupancies and sent to community health centers for
   treatment and follow-up. It never quite worked out properly and this
   population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with
   no sustainable support system.^[102]^[103]

   In 1965, The Diggers, a community-action group dedicated to the concept
   of everything being free of charge, established soup kitchens and free
   health-care facilities in the Haight-Ashbury district of San
   Francisco.^[104] This also began a movement of people that began to
   travel for political reasons as well as for personal choices. This is
   where the beginnings of the American nomadic caravans became popular,
   living homelessly, but happily.

   In 1969 the Pine Street Inn was founded by Paul Sullivan on Pine Street
   in Boston's Chinatown district and began caring for homeless destitute
   alcoholics. In 1980, it moved to larger facilities on Harrison Avenue
   in Boston due to growing needs of the homeless population.^[105]^[106]

   In 1974, Kip Tiernan founded Rosie's Place in Boston, the first drop-in
   and emergency shelter for women in the United States, in response to
   the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country.

   In 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action
   suit before the courts, Callahan v. Carey, against the City and State,
   arguing for a person's state constitutional "right to shelter". It was
   settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed
   to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need
   standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards.
   By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.

1980s[edit]

   The number of homeless people grew in the 1980s, as housing and social
   service cuts increased and the economy deteriorated. The United States
   government determined that somewhere between 200,000 and 500,000
   Americans were then homeless.^[107] There were some U.S. federal
   initiatives that aimed to help, end and prevent homelessness, however,
   there were no designated homeless-related programs in the Office of
   Management and Budget.^[108]

   The History of the United States (1980–1991) illustrates that this was
   a time when there was economic distress, high unemployment, and was the
   period when chronic homelessness became a societal problem. In 1980,
   federal funds accounted for 22% of big city budgets, but by 1989 the
   similar aid composed only 6% of urban revenue (part of a larger 60%
   decrease in federal spending to support local governments).^[109] It is
   largely (although not exclusively) in these urban areas that
   homelessness became widespread and reached unprecedented numbers.

   Most notable were cuts to federal low-income housing programs. An
   advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for public
   housing and Section 8 (the government's housing voucher subsidization
   program) and that between the years of 1980 and 1989 HUD's budget
   authority was reduced from $74 billion to $19 billion.^[109] Such
   alleged changes is claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of
   affordable housing to meet the growing demand of low-income
   populations. In 1970 there were 300,000 more low-cost rental units (6.5
   million) than low-income renter households (6.2 million). By 1985, the
   advocacy group claimed that the number of low-cost units had fallen to
   5.6 million, and the number of low-income renter households had grown
   to 8.9 million, a disparity of 3.3 million units^[110]

   The 1980s also saw a continuing trend of deinstitutionalizing
   mental-health treatment. It is believed^[who?] that a large percentage
   of these released patients ended up in the homeless system.

   Many existing shelters and soup kitchens had to expand their facilities
   to accommodate the larger number of homeless. For example, in 1980, the
   Pine Street Inn had to move to larger facilities on Harrison Avenue in
   Boston^[105]^[106] and in 1984, Saint Francis House had to move its
   operation from the St. Anthony Shrine on Arch Street to an entire
   ten-floor building on Boylston Street.^[111]

   The January 2, 1984 issue of Newsweek magazine had a front cover of the
   Reynolds family in Galveston, Texas, with the cover title, "Homeless in
   America", thereby bringing the homelessness issue to continued national
   attention.

   In response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s, concerned
   citizens across the country^[who?] demanded that the federal government
   provide assistance. After many years of advocacy and numerous
   revisions, President Reagan signed into law the McKinney-Vento Homeless
   Assistance Act in 1987—this remains the only piece of federal
   legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless
   people.

   By the mid-1980s, there was also a dramatic increase in family
   homelessness. Tied into this was an increasing number of impoverished
   and runaway children, teenagers, and young adults, which created a new
   sub-stratum of the homeless population.

1990s[edit]

   The McKinney-Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the
   coming years. During the 1990s homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and
   other supportive services sprouted up in cities and towns across the
   nation. However, despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth
   marked by this decade, homeless numbers remained stubbornly high. It
   became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to
   alleviate the symptoms of homelessness (i.e. shelter beds, hot meals,
   psychiatric counseling, etc.), although needed, were not successful at
   solving the root causes of homelessness.

2000s[edit]

   Throughout this decade, homeless service providers and the Federal
   government have been able to reduce chronic homelessness and
   homelessness among Veterans with targeted efforts and interagency
   cooperation on initiatives like the HUD-VASH program.^[112] The 2000s,
   however, saw a new population of those experiencing homelessness:
   families with children. While an emerging problem at the beginning of
   the decade,^[113] the problem continued to persist through 2010. At the
   close of the decade the trend continued unabated, with the number of
   individuals in homeless families increasing from 431,541 in 2007 to
   535,447 in 2009.^[112]

   Another emerging concern at the onset of this decade was the
   disproportionate representation of the LGBTQ community among the
   population of unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness. In 2002,
   activist and youth advocate Carl Siciliano founded the Ali Forney
   Center—a homeless shelter in New York City that is dedicated
   specifically to providing aid and shelter to homeless and at-risk LGBTQ
   youth. The center takes its name from a homosexual teenager who lived
   on the streets for much of the 1990s. While homeless, Ali Forney
   protected other LGBTQ homeless youth by performing HIV prevention and
   awareness work. He also urged the NYPD to investigate the murders of
   several homosexual homeless youth whom he had befriended during his
   time on the street. In 1997, Ali Forney was himself murdered by an
   attacker who has not yet been identified. However, Ali's outreach and
   advocacy work inspired Carl Siciliano to found an organization
   dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQ homeless youth in New York.
   The Ali Forney Center provides both emergency and transitional housing
   for homosexual homeless youth, whose numbers account for anywhere
   between 20–40% of the 2.1 million homeless youth in America. The
   percentage of LGBTQ homeless youth is much higher than that of the
   general population, which runs between 5–10%.^[32] The work of the Ali
   Forney Center is one example of the ways that the social service
   community has responded to the needs of growing sub-populations of
   those experiencing homelessness.

   In 2001, the NAEH along with the U.S. ICH encouraged communities to
   create and implement state and local strategic plans to prevent and end
   homelessness, focusing on Housing First initiatives to house the
   chronically homeless population who have many barriers to stability, a
   cost-benefit analysis of state- and local-level resources, best
   practice engagement and service innovations, and prevention.^[114] Many
   communities and states across the country have created these plans and
   have set up measurable goals and targets for the short- and
   long-term.^[115]

   There were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons
   nationwide in January 2009. About two-thirds of those stayed in
   emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs, with the
   remaining living on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas
   not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about
   0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a
   transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30,
   2009.^[116] Around 44% of homeless people were employed.^[117]

   In February 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was part of the President's effort to
   save or create 3.5 million jobs in the United States to mitigate the
   effects of the economic recession begun in 2008. Part of the Act
   addressed homelessness prevention, in which he allocated an additional
   $1.5 billion to HUD for the "Homelessness Prevention and Rapid
   Rehousing Program (HPRP)." The purpose of HPRP was to assist
   individuals and families who are otherwise healthy and not chronically
   homeless in escaping homelessness or preventing homelessness of the
   vulnerable population. HPRP grant monies were distributed to localities
   in the same formula used for Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) in amounts
   not to exceed $500,000 and must be used within three years. Primary
   grantee activities include short-term and medium-term rental assistance
   and housing relocation and stabilization services, including mediation,
   credit counseling, security or utility deposits, utility payments,
   moving cost assistance, and case management.^[118]^[119]

   On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency
   Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act into Public Law
   (Public Law 111-22 or "PL 111-22"), reauthorizing HUD's Homeless
   Assistance programs. It was part of the Helping Families Save Their
   Homes Act of 2009. The HEARTH act allows for the prevention of
   homelessness, rapid re-housing, consolidation of housing programs, and
   new homeless categories. In the eighteen months after the bill's
   signing, HUD had to begin implementing the new McKinney-compliant
   programs.^[120]^[121] In late 2009, some homeless advocacy
   organizations, such as the National Coalition for the Homeless,
   reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009
   as a HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization bill, especially with regard to
   privacy, definitional ineligibility, community roles, and restrictions
   on eligibile activities.^[122] However, at the close of 2010 HUD
   reported that many communities had successfully used HPRP funds to
   assist those in need in their communities, and reported that the
   program prevented homelessness for nearly 750,000 Americans.^[123]

   The Federal government contains one agency that focuses on the issue of
   homelessness in America, and it has had a much greater role in the
   policy community since its revitalization at the beginning of the
   decade and its continued appropriations in the HEARTH Act. The United
   States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH),a federal agency
   contained in the Executive Branch, was established in 1987 as a
   requirement of the McKinney-Vento Act of 1987. Since its revitalization
   in 2001 as an agency independent from the Executive Office of the
   President and reauthorization in 2009, USICH serves as the coordinating
   body of all 19 federal agencies and their programs and initiatives to
   serve the homeless population.^[124] Its mission is to, "coordinate the
   Federal response to homelessness and to create a national partnership
   at every lever of government and with the private sector to reduce and
   end homelessness in the nation while maximizing the effectiveness of
   the Federal Government in contributing to the end of
   homelessness."^[125] USICH has taken on a much greater role in
   Federal-level initiatives to end homelessness in the United States
   since exiting the Executive Office of the President and notably since
   the enactment of the HEARTH Act, in which it was mandated that USICH
   provide leadership in developing a national strategic plan to prevent
   and end homelessness.^[126] Since its authorization as an independent
   agency, USICH been able to work with stakeholders across all government
   sectors and at all levels to promote collaboration and best practices
   within the homeless service provider community.

2010s[edit]

   The first year of the new decade saw a renewed commitment from the
   Federal government in its efforts to prevent and end homelessness with
   the creation and release of Opening Doors: The Federal Strategic Plan
   to Prevent and End Homelessness.^[127]^[128] Opening Doors is a
   publication of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which
   worked with all Federal agencies and many state and local stakeholders
   on its creation and vision, setting a ten-year path for the nation on
   preventing and ending all types of homelessness. This Plan was
   presented to the President and Congress in a White House Ceremony on
   June 22, 2010.^[129]

   The Vision of the Plan is: "No one should experience homelessness – no
   one should be without a safe, stable place to call home."

   This document focuses on four main goals:
     * Finish the job of ending chronic homelessness in the next five
       years (2015)
     * Prevent and end homelessness among Veterans in five years (2015)
     * Prevent and end homelessness for families, children and youth in
       ten years (2020)
     * Set a path to ending all types of homelessness

   The 2011 point-in-time count by HUD took place during the last two
   weeks of January 2011,^[130] and data reported at that time and
   gathered from service providers in local communities was used to
   compile the 2010 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report which was
   released in the middle of 2011.

Situations in specific U.S. cities and states[edit]

Chicago, Illinois[edit]

   The city of Chicago, Illinois is also noted for its number of homeless
   people. Over the years, Chicago has gained a reputation as the city
   with the most homeless people, rivaling Los Angeles and New York,
   although no statistical data have backed this up. The reputation stems
   primarily from the subjective number of beggars found on the streets
   rather than any sort of objective statistical census data. Indeed, from
   statistical data, Chicago has far less homeless per capita than peers
   New York, and Los Angeles, or other major cities such as Philadelphia,
   San Francisco, and Boston, among others, with only 5,922 homeless
   recorded in a one night count taken in 2007.^[131]

Denver, Colorado[edit]

   While Mayor of Denver, Colorado, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper
   made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority
   on his Mayoral agenda, speaking heavily on the issue during his first
   "State of the City" address in 2003. While Denver's homeless population
   is much lower than other major cities, the homeless residents have
   often suffered when without shelter during Denver's infamously cold
   winters. Now officials have said that this number has risen over the
   past few years.^[132]

Florida[edit]

   Homeless advocate and urban designer Michael E. Arth proposed building
   a Pedestrian village for the adult homeless in Volusia County near
   Daytona Beach, Florida in 2007.^[133]^[134]^[135] As of 2009, Arth was
   still working toward trying to consolidate most of the scattered 19
   local agencies into an attractive community that would be designed to
   more effectively address the needs of the chronically adult homeless
   and the temporarily adult homeless, as well as others who may be having
   difficulty fitting into the pervasive, automobile-dominated culture. He
   writes that the current "piecemeal approach" inefficiently spreads out
   services and work opportunities, and aggravates the problem by
   polarizing citizens who might otherwise be inclined to help. In
   response to critics who say that such a village would be like a
   concentration camp, Arth points out that the U.S. already concentrates
   their citizens into prisons at 7–8 times the rate of Canada or Europe.
   "There should be alternative between living on the street and being
   locked up that addresses the needs of the chronically and temporarily
   adult homeless." His proposed "Tiger Bay Village" would have a
   community garden and orchard, a place to hire certified workers, and a
   work crew to help build and maintain the village. "Little shops in the
   village center could process and rehabilitate donated clothes and
   furnishings to be sold to the public." Housing would range from
   multi-bed barracks to small Katrina cottages depending on a person's
   contributions to the village, special needs, and income. Arth claims
   that this would cost less and be far more effective than any of the
   other solutions tried elsewhere.^[136]

Indianapolis, Indiana[edit]

   In^[137] Indianapolis, Indiana, as many as 2,200 people are homeless on
   any given night, and as many as 15,000 individuals over the course of a
   year. Indianapolis is notable among cities of similar size for having
   only faith-based shelters, such as the century-old^[138] Wheeler
   Mission. In 2001, Mayor Bart Peterson endorsed a 10-year plan, called
   the^[139] Blueprint to End Homelessness, and made it one of his
   administration's top priorities. The plan's main goals are for more
   affordable housing units, employment opportunities, and support
   services. The Blueprint notwithstanding, Indianapolis has criminalized
   aspects of homelessness, such as making panhandling a misdemeanor; and
   the^[140] City-County Council has twice (in April 2002, and August
   2005) denied the zoning necessary to open a new shelter for homeless
   women.

Los Angeles, California[edit]

   In its January 2013 census, Los Angeles County counted 39,463 people
   sleeping on the street or in homeless shelters.^[141] When including
   persons sleeping on private property with permission to stay no more
   than 90 days, the estimated number of homeless in Los Angeles County is
   57,737.^[141] The number of people in the latter category, called
   "precariously housed" or "at risk of homelessness", was estimated by
   means of a telephone survey. The number of homeless in Los Angeles
   County, including the precariously housed and at risk of homelessness,
   was 51,340 in 2011, of which 23,539 were in the City of Los Angeles,
   and 4,316 were in the 50 block area east of downtown Los Angeles
   informally known as Skid Row.^[142] It is estimated that 190,207 people
   are homeless in Los Angeles County at least one night during the
   year.^[143]

   The 2013 census notes that 31.4% of the homeless in Los Angeles County
   are substance abusers, 30.2% are mentally ill, and 18.2% have a
   physical disability. The census also notes that 68.2% of the homeless
   are male, 38% are African American, 37% are Caucasian, 28% are
   Hispanic, and 57.6% are between 25 and 54 years old.^[144]

   On a given night, about 12,934 homeless people stay in a shelter.^[141]
   The number includes families staying in motels on emergency vouchers.

Massachusetts[edit]

   In December 2007, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, announced that the
   one night homeless count had revealed that the actual number of
   homeless living in the streets was down.^[145]

   In October 2008, Connie Paige of The Boston Globe reported that the
   number of homeless in Massachusetts had reached an all-time high,
   mostly due to mortgage foreclosures and the national economic
   crisis.^[146]

   In October 2009, as part of the city's Leading the Way initiative,
   Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston dedicated and opened the Weintraub Day
   Center which is the first city-operated day center for chronically
   homeless persons. It is a multi-service center, providing shelter,
   counseling, health care, housing assistance, and other support
   services. It is a 3,400-square-foot (320 m^2) facility located in the
   Woods Mullen Shelter. It is also meant to reduce the strain on the
   city's hospital emergency rooms by providing services and identifying
   health problems before they escalate into emergencies. It was funded by
   $3 million in grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
   2009, Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development
   (DHCD), the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable
   Foundation,^[147] and the United States Department of Health and Human
   Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
   (SAMHSA).^[148]

   In 2010, there was a continued crackdown on panhandling, especially the
   aggressive type, in downtown Boston. Summonses were being handed out,
   with scheduled court appearances. The results were mixed and in one
   upscale neighborhood, Beacon Hill, the resolve of the Beacon Hill Civic
   Association, which has received only one complaint about panhandlers,
   was to try to solve the bigger problem not by criminal actions.^[149]

   Due to economic constraints in 2010, Governor Deval Patrick had to cut
   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2011 budget so dental care for the
   majority of adults, including most homeless people, covered by
   MassHealth (Medicaid) would no longer be provided except for cleaning
   and extractions, with no fillings, dentures, or restorative
   care.^[150]^[151] This does not affect dental care for children. The
   measure took effect in July 2010 and affects an estimated 700,000
   adults, including 130,000 seniors.^[152]

   In September 2010, it was reported that the Housing First Initiative
   had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population
   in Boston, Massachusetts, although homeless families were still
   increasing in number. Some shelters were reducing the number of beds
   due to lowered numbers of homeless, and some emergency shelter
   facilities were closing, especially the emergency Boston Night
   Center.^[153]

   There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter
   as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston
   wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing
   large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen
   for their private use and catering.^[154]^[155]

New York City, New York[edit]

   A homeless man down and out in New York City.

   On March 18, 2013, the New York City Department of Homeless Services
   reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of:^[156]
     * 27,844 adults
     * 20,627 children
     * 48,471 total individuals

   According to the Coalition for the Homeless, the homeless population of
   New York rose to an all-time high in 2011. A reported 113,552 people
   slept in the city's emergency shelters last year, including over 40,000
   children; marking an 8 percent increase from the previous year and a 37
   percent increase from 2002. There was also a rise in the number of
   families relying on shelters, approximately 29,000. That is an increase
   of 80% from 2002. About half of the people who slept in shelter in 2010
   returned for housing in 2011.^[157]^[158]

   According to the NYC Department of Homeless Services, 64 percent of
   those applying for emergency shelter in 2010 were denied. Several were
   denied because they were said to have family who could house them when
   in actuality this might not have been the case. Applicants may have
   faced overcrowding, unsafe conditions, or may have had relatives
   unwilling to house them. According to Mary Brosnaham, spokeswoman for
   Coalition for the Homeless, the administration of Mayor Michael
   Bloomberg employs a deliberate policy of "active deterrence".

   Part of the problem lies with long-term joblessness that characterizes
   the United States' economic crisis. According to the Center for an
   Urban Future about a third of the adult workers in New York City are
   low-wage earners, making under $11.54 an hour. Affordable rent rates
   considered to be no more than a third of the renter's wages. A family
   in New York City must earn at least $54,000 to find an affordable home.
   The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is
   barely $30,000 and $35,000 respectively. According to the Community
   Service Society, "Two-thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one-third of
   near poor households—up to twice the poverty level—spend at least half
   of their incomes on rent…and place millions of low-income New Yorkers
   at risk of housing hardships and displacement."

   The New York City Housing Authority is experiencing record demand for
   subsidized housing assistance. However, just 13,000 of the 29,000
   families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or
   received federal housing vouchers known as [Section 8] in 2010. Due to
   budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive
   Section 8.^[159]

   In March 2010, there were protests about the Governor's proposed cut of
   $65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services
   system.^[160] The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt
   to the Advantage program, threatening to cast 15,000 families back into
   the shelters or onto the streets. A court has delayed the cut until May
   2011 because there was doubt over the legality of cancelling the city's
   commitment. However, the Advantage program^[161] itself was consciously
   advanced by the Bloomberg administration as an alternative to providing
   long-term affordable housing opportunities for the poor and working
   class. The result, as the [Coalition for the Homeless] report points
   out, is that "Thousands of formerly-homeless children and families have
   been forced back into homelessness, In addition, Mayor Bloomberg
   proposed $37 million in cuts to the city's budget for homeless services
   this year.^[158]

San Francisco, California[edit]

   The city of San Francisco, California has a significant and visible
   homeless problem. Approximately 61% of the homeless population were
   already living and working in San Francisco when they became homeless,
   indicating that a vast majority of people experiencing homelessness did
   not come to the city for its resources but rather are being priced out
   of their home.^[162] The city's homeless population has been estimated
   at 7,000–10,000 people, of which approximately 3,000–5,000 refuse
   shelter due to the conditions within the shelters including violence,
   racism, and homophobia and transphobia. Additionally, there are only
   1,339 available shelter beds for the approximately 10,000 people
   sleeping outdoors.^[163] The city spends $200 million a year on
   homelessness related programs.^[164] On May 3, 2004,^[165] San
   Francisco officially began an attempt to scale back the scope of its
   homelessness problem by changing its strategy from cash payments to the
   "Care Not Cash" plan which has had no visible impact on reducing
   homelessness in the city. At the same time, grassroots organizations
   within the Bay Area such as the Suitcase Clinic work to provide
   referrals for housing and employment to the homeless population. Other
   organizations like the Coalition On Homelessness fight for increasing
   affordable and supportive housing in the quickly changing housing
   landscape of San Francisco. In 2010, a city ordinance was passed to
   disallow sitting and lying down on public sidewalks for most of the
   day, from 7 am until 11 pm furthering a "criminalization" strategy for
   responding to homelessness.^[166]^[167]

Washington, D.C.[edit]

   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated in 2013
   the number of homeless in Washington, D.C. as 6,865, which was a 29
   percent increase after 2007.^[168] D.C. ranks eighth regarding total
   homeless population among other major American cities. The city passed
   a law that requires to provide shelter to everybody in need when the
   temperature drops below freezing.^[169] Since D.C. does not have enough
   shelter units available, every winter it books hotel rooms in the
   suburbs with an average cost around $100 for a night. According to the
   D.C. Department of Human Services, during the winter of 2012 the city
   spent $2,544,454 on putting homeless families in hotels,^[170] and
   budgeted $3.2 million on hotel beds in 2013.^[171]

Public Libraries and Homelessness[edit]

   The American Library Association's (2010) Policy 61, Services to Poor
   and Homeless People addresses the complex of problems posed by poverty:

     recognizes the urgent need to respond to the increasing number of
     poor children, adults, and families in America. These people are
     affected by a combination of limitations,including illiteracy,
     illness, social isolation, homelessness, hunger, and discrimination,
     which hamper the effectiveness of traditional library services.
     Therefore it is crucial that libraries recognize their role in
     enabling poor people to participate fully in a democratic society,
     by utilizing a wide variety of available resources and strategies.
     Concrete programs of training and development are needed to
     sensitize and prepare library staff to identify poor people’s needs
     and deliver relevant services. And within the American Library
     Association the coordinating mechanisms of programs and activities
     dealing with poor people in various divisions, offices, and units
     should be strengthened, and support for low-income liaison
     activities should be enhanced. (para. 1)^[172]

   The Park Central Branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia has created
   a program called the H.O.M.E Page Cafe. The project is the result of a
   collaboration between the Free Library of Philadelphia and a local
   non-profit, Project H.O.M.E. The H.O.M.E Page Cafe is a coffee shop in
   the library that offers a number of beverages and snacks, much like the
   average cafe. However, the workers are formerly homeless living in
   supported housing that are hired based on potential and need. It is an
   active effort to help the homeless get back on their feet and provide
   them with training they can then use for future employment. More
   information about the H.O.M.E Page Cafe can be found on their website:
   http://www.projecthome.org/cafe/homepage.php.

   The video entitled, “Libraries Should Welcome the Homeless,”^[173] is
   about a downtown Los Angeles public library that illustrates how
   important the library’s role is when it comes to homeless individuals.
   The video follows a homeless patron named, Phillip Sapple, who lost his
   job and home. He went to the library everyday since his lost job. The
   video mentions that Phillip is an artist and has started a small
   business by having patrons and staff draw pictures from photos.

   The news article and video entitled, “SF library offers Social Services
   to Homeless,”^[174] speaks about the step of SF library having a full
   time social worker at there library to reduce and help homeless
   patrons. It mentions that Leah Esguerra, who is a psychiatric social
   worker. Her usual routine is done by making her rounds to different
   homeless patrons and greeting them to see if she could help them. She
   offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons
   with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also
   supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful
   employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight,
   2010).^[175] The changes have garnered positive results from all
   patrons. Since this service started, staff at the library stated that
   they have noticed a drop in inappropriate behavior.

   The San Jose University Library became one of the first academic
   libraries to pay attention to the needs of the homeless and implement
   changes to better serve this population. In 2007, the merged University
   Library and Public Library made the choice to be proactive in reaching
   out. Collaborations with nonprofit organizations in the area culminated
   in computer classes being taught, as well as nutrition classes, family
   literacy programs, and book discussion groups (Collins, 2009).^[176]
   After eighteen months, the library staff felt they still weren’t doing
   enough and “analyzed program participation trends supplemented by
   observation and anecdotes” in order to better understand the
   information needs of the homeless. When it was understood that these
   needs are complex, additional customer service training was provided to
   all staff who were interested (Collins, 2009, p. 112).^[176] Once the
   staff more fully understood the needs of the homeless, it was
   determined that many programs in place already would be helpful to the
   homeless with a few minor adjustments. Programs were tailored to meet
   these needs. Additional changes implemented included temporary computer
   passes and generous in-house reading space to counteract the policies
   in place that may prevent the homeless from obtaining a library card
   (Collins, 2009).New York Public Library offers services to those
   homeless residing in shelters.

   Unfortunately, libraries are not always proactive in their service to
   the local homeless. As an article about a man in Belleville shows, not
   all homeless people are provided with ample access to the resources a
   library has to offer (Girresch, 2011). The Belleville Public Library
   invalidated the library card of the local man when the staff discovered
   that he was homeless and no longer had a permanent address. Steve
   Johnson, who had lost his job and subsequently his apartment last year,
   relies on the public library for Internet access to apply for jobs.
   Because his library card has been invalidated, he is limited to only 30
   minutes of computer use a day—severely restricting his ability to hunt
   and apply for jobs online (Girresch, 2011).^[177] This situation, and
   others like it, call into question those library policies that begin to
   hinder the public that the library serves. How far should library
   policy reach? Are staff required to adhere to policy when it conflicts
   with a patron's right to information? What obligation does the library
   have to the homeless? The answers to these and other questions need to
   be defined. The Richard Kreimer case (noted below) helps to force
   public libraries to consider the issue, however more discussion needs
   to be initiated for public libraries to understand their role and their
   obligations towards homeless patrons.

Kreimer v. Morristown Library[edit]

   In May 1991, Richard Kreimer, a homeless man in Morristown, N.J. sued
   the local public library and the Town of Morristown for kicking him out
   of the library after other patrons complained about his disruptive
   behavior and pungent body odor. He later won the case and settled for
   $250,000.^[178]^[179]

Homeless perspective[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (August 2014)

   Kevin Barbieux, a homeless blogger in Tennessee, wrote that he has “had
   only a few negative experiences with libraries and they were due
   usually to an over zealous (sic) librarian or security guard enforcing
   some rule or another.”^[180]
