   field.

   Agriculture is a major industry in the United States, and the country
   is a net exporter of food.^[1] As of the last census of agriculture in
   2007, there were 2.2 million farms, covering an area of 922 million
   acres (3,730,000 km^2), an average of 418 acres (1.69 km^2) per
   farm.^[2] Although agricultural activity occurs in most states, it is
   particularly concentrated in the vast expanse of flat, arable land
   known as the Great Plains, which encompasses the central region of the
   nation and in the region around the Great Lakes known as the Corn
   Belt.^[3]

History[edit]

   Main article: Agricultural history of the United States
   Cotton farming on a Southern plantation in 1921

   Corn, turkeys, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts, and sunflower seeds
   constitute some of the major holdovers from the agricultural endowment
   of the Americas.

   European agricultural practices greatly affected the New England
   landscape, leaving behind many physical foot prints. Colonists brought
   livestock over from Europe which caused many changes to the land.
   Grazing animals required a lot of land and food to sustain them and due
   to grazing, native grasses were destroyed and European species began to
   replace them. New species of weeds were introduced and began to thrive
   as they were capable of withstanding the grazing of animals, whereas
   native species could not.^[4]

   The practices associated with keeping livestock also contributed to the
   deterioration of the forests and fields. Colonists would cut down the
   trees and then allow their cattle and livestock to graze freely in the
   forest and never plant more trees. The animals trampled and tore up the
   ground so much as to cause long-term destruction and damage.^[4]

   Soil exhaustion was a huge problem in New England agriculture. Farming
   with oxen did allow the colonist to farm more land but it increased
   erosion and decreased soil fertility. This was due to deeper plow cuts
   in the soil that allowed the soil more contact with oxygen causing
   nutrient depletion. In grazing fields, the large number of cattle in
   the New England, the soil was being compacted by the cattle and this
   didn't give the soil enough oxygen to sustain life.^[4]

   In the U.S., farms spread from the colonies westward along with the
   settlers. In cooler regions, wheat was often the crop of choice when
   lands were newly settled, leading to a "wheat frontier" that moved
   westward over the course of years. Also very common in the antebellum
   Midwest was farming corn while raising hogs, complementing each other
   especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the
   canals and railroads. After the "wheat frontier" had passed through an
   area, more diversified farms including dairy cattle generally took its
   place. Warmer regions saw plantings of cotton and herds of beef cattle.
   In the early colonial south, raising tobacco and cotton was common,
   especially through the use of slave labor until the Civil War. In the
   northeast, slaves were used in agriculture until the early 19th
   century.^[citation needed] In the Midwest, slavery was prohibited by
   the Freedom Ordinance of 1787.

   The introduction and broad adoption of scientific agriculture since the
   mid nineteenth century has made a large improvement in the USA's
   economic growth. This development was facilitated by the Morrill Act
   and the Hatch Act of 1887 which established in each state a land-grant
   university (with a mission to teach and study agriculture) and a
   federally funded system of agricultural experiment stations and
   cooperative extension networks which place extension agents in each
   state.

   Soybeans were not widely cultivated in the United States until the
   1950s, when soybeans began to replace oats and wheat.

   Significant areas of farmland were abandoned during the Great
   Depression and incorporated into nascent national forests. Later,
   "Sodbuster" and "Swampbuster" restrictions written into federal farm
   programs starting in the 1970s reversed a decades-long trend of habitat
   destruction that began in 1942 when farmers were encouraged to plant
   all possible land in support of the war effort. In the United States,
   federal programs administered through local Soil and Water Conservation
   Districts provide technical assistance and partial funding to farmers
   who wish to implement management practices to conserve soil and limit
   erosion and floods.

Major agricultural products[edit]

   Satellite image of circular crop fields characteristic of center pivot
   irrigation in Kansas (June 2001). Healthy, growing crops are green.
   Corn would be growing into leafy stalks by late June. Sorghum, which
   resembles corn, grows more slowly and would be much smaller and
   therefore, possibly paler. Wheat is a brilliant gold as harvest occurs
   in June. Fields of brown have been recently harvested and plowed under
   or lie fallow for the year.

   The top twenty agricultural products of the United States by value as
   reported by the FAO in 2003 (ranked in order of value with volume in
   metric tons):^[5]^[verification needed]
    1. Corn                     256,900,000
    2. Cattle meat               11,736,000

   The only other crops to ever appear in the top 20 in the last 40 years
   were commonly tobacco, barley, and oats, and rarely, peanuts, almonds,
   and sunflower seeds. Alfalfa and hay would both be in the top ten in
   2003 if they were tracked by FAO.

   Note alfalfa and hay are not tracked by the FAO and the production of
   tobacco in the U.S. has fallen 60% between 1997 and 2003.

Yield[edit]

   U.S. agriculture has a high yield relative to other countries. The
   yield was (in 2004):^[7]
     * Corn for grain, average of 160.4 bushels harvested per acre (10.07
       t/ha)
     * Soybean for beans, average of 42.5 bushels harvested per acre (2.86
       t/ha)
     * Wheat, average of 43.2 bushels harvested per acre (2.91 t/ha, was
       44.2 bu/ac or 2.97 t/ha in 2003)

Livestock[edit]

   The major livestock industries in the United States are:
     * Dairy cattle
     * Beef cattle
     * Swine (also called hogs or pigs)
     * Poultry
     * Sheep

   Goats, horses, turkeys and bees are also raised, though in lesser
   quantities. Inventory data is not as readily available as for the major
   industries. For the three major goat-producing states (AZ, NM, and TX)
   there were 1,200,000 goats at the end of 2002. There were 5,300,000
   horses in the United States at the end of 1998. There were 2,500,000
   colonies of bees at the end of 2002.

Farm type or majority enterprise type[edit]

   Farm type is based on which commodities are the majority crops grown on
   a farm. Nine common types include:
     * Cash grains includes corn, soybeans and other grains (wheat, oats,
       barley, sorghum), dry edible beans, peas, and rice.
     * Tobacco
     * Cotton
     * Other field crops includes peanuts, potatoes, sunflowers, sweet
       potatoes, sugarcane, broomcorn, popcorn, sugar beets, mint, hops,
       seed crops, hay, silage, forage, etc. Tobacco and cotton can be
       included here if not in their own separate category.
     * High value crops includes fruits, vegetables, melons, tree nuts,
       greenhouse, nursery crops, and horticultural specialties.
     * Cattle
     * Hogs
     * Dairy
     * Poultry and Eggs

Governance[edit]

   Main articles: Agricultural policy in the United States and
   Agricultural subsidy

   Agriculture in the United States is primarily governed by periodically
   renewed U.S. farm bills. Governance is both a federal and a local
   responsibility with the United States Department of Agriculture being
   the federal department responsible. Government aid includes research
   into crop types and regional suitability as well as many kinds of
   subsidies, some price supports and loan programs. U.S. farmers are not
   subject to production quotas and some laws are different for farms
   compared to other workplaces.

   Labor laws prohibiting children in other workplaces provide some
   exemptions for children working on farms with complete exemptions for
   children working on their family's farm. Children can also gain permits
   from vocational training schools or the 4-H club which allow them to do
   jobs they would otherwise not be permitted to do.

   A large part of the U.S. farm workforce is made up of migrant and
   seasonal workers, many of them recent immigrants from Latin America or
   aliens working under work permits. Additional laws apply to these
   workers and their housing which is often provided by the farmer.

Employment[edit]

   In 1870, 70-80 percent of the US population was employed in
   agriculture.^[14] As of 2008^[update], less than 2 percent of the
   population is directly employed in agriculture.^[15]^[16]

   In 2010, there were 1,202,500 farmers, ranchers and other agricultural
   managers and an estimated 757,900 agricultural workers were legally
   employed in the US. Animal breeders accounted for 11,500 of those
   workers with the rest categorized as miscellaneous agricultural
   workers. The median pay was $9.12 per hour or $18,970 per year.^[17] In
   2009, about 519,000 people under age 20 worked on farms owned by their
   family. In addition to the youth who lived on family farms, an
   additional 230,000 youth were employed in agriculture.^[18]

Agriculture safety and health[edit]

   Agriculture ranks among the most hazardous industries.^[19] Farmers are
   at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries, work-related lung
   diseases, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, chemical-related
   illnesses, and certain cancers associated with chemical use and
   prolonged sun exposure.^[20] In an average year, 516 workers die doing
   farm work in the U.S. (1992–2005). Every day, about 243 agricultural
   workers suffer lost-work-time injuries, and about 5% of these result in
   permanent impairment.^[21] Tractor overturns are the leading cause of
   agriculture-related fatal injuries, and account for over 90 deaths
   every year. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health
   recommends the use of roll over protection structures on tractors to
   reduce the risk of overturn-related fatal injuries.^[21]

   Farming is one of the few industries in which families (who often share
   the work and live on the premises) are also at risk for injuries,
   illness, and death. Agriculture is the most dangerous industry for
   young workers, accounting for 42% of all work-related fatalities of
   young workers in the U.S. between 1992 and 2000. In 2011, 108 youth,
   less than 20 years of age, died from farm-related injuries.^[18] Unlike
   other industries, half the young victims in agriculture were under age
   15.^[22] For young agricultural workers aged 15–17, the risk of fatal
   injury is four times the risk for young workers in other
   workplaces^[23] Agricultural work exposes young workers to safety
   hazards such as machinery, confined spaces, work at elevations, and
   work around livestock. The most common causes of fatal farm-related
   youth injuries involve machinery, motor vehicles, or drowning. Together
   these three causes comprise more than half of all fatal injuries to
   youth on U.S. farms.^[24]

Research centers[edit]

   Some US research centers are focused on the topic of health and safety
   in agricultural practices. These centers not only conduct research on
   the subject of occupational disease and injury prevention, but also
   promote agricultural health and safety through educational outreach
   programs. Most of these groups are funded by the National Institute for
   Occupational Safety and Health, the US Department of Agriculture, or
   other state agencies.^[25] Centers include:
     * Northeast Center for Agricultural and Occupational Health, New York
       Center for Agricultural Medicine and Health, Cooperstown, NY^[26]
     * Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health, University of Iowa,
       Iowa City, IA
