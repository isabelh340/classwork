   The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC),^[5]
   also referred to as the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public
   Health Service, is the federal uniformed service of the U.S. Public
   Health Service (PHS) and is one of the seven uniformed services of the
   United States.

   Along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   Commissioned Officer Corps, the Public Health Service Commissioned
   Corps is one of two uniformed services that only consist of
   commissioned officers and has no enlisted or warrant officer ranks,
   although warrant officers have been authorized for use within the
   service.^[6] Officers of the PHS are classified as noncombatants,
   unless directed to serve as part of the armed forces by the President
   or detailed to a service branch of the armed forces.^[7] Members of the
   PHSCC wear the same uniforms as the United States Navy and the United
   States Coast Guard (when assigned to the Coast Guard) with special
   corps insignia, and hold ranks equivalent to those of naval officers.
   Officers of the PHSCC receive their commissions through the PHSCC's
   direct commissioning program.

   As with its parent division, the PHS, the PHSCC is under the direction
   of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The PHSCC
   is led by the Surgeon General who holds grade of vice admiral.^[8] The
   Surgeon General reports directly to the Assistant Secretary for Health
   who may hold the rank of admiral if he or she is a serving member of
   the PHSCC.^[8]

History[edit]

   The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps had its beginnings with
   the creation of the Marine Hospital Fund in 1798, which later was
   reorganized in 1871 as the Marine Hospital Service. The Marine Hospital
   Service was charged with the care and maintenance of merchant sailors,
   but as the country grew, so did the ever-expanding mission of the
   service. The Marine Hospital Service soon began taking on new expanding
   health roles that included such health initiatives that protected the
   commerce and health of America. One such role was quarantine.

   Dr. John Maynard Woodworth, a famous surgeon of the Union Army who
   served under General William Tecumseh Sherman, was appointed in 1871 as
   the Supervising Surgeon. Dr. Woodworth's title was later changed to
   "Supervising Surgeon General," which later became the Surgeon General
   of the United States. Dr. Woodworth is credited with the formal
   creation of the Commissioned Corps. Dr. Woodworth organized the Marine
   Hospital Service medical personnel along Army military structure in
   1889, to facilitate a mobile force of health professionals that could
   be moved for the needs of the service and country. He also established
   appointment standards and designed the Marine Hospital Service herald
   of a fouled anchor and caduceus. Later that year of 1889, President
   Grover Cleveland signed an Act into law that formally established the
   modern Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (then the Marine
   Hospital Service under the Supervising Surgeon (later Surgeon
   General)). At first open only to physicians, over the course of the
   twentieth century, the Corps expanded to include dentists, engineers,
   pharmacists, nurses, environmental health specialists, scientists, and
   other health professionals.

   Today, the PHSCC is under the United States Public Health Service
   (PHS), a major agency now of the United States Department of Health and
   Human Services, (HHS)), established by Congress in 1979-1980. It was
   previously established in 1953 as the United States Department of
   Health, Education and Welfare, (HEW) and is still led by the Surgeon
   General. The PHSCC allocate officers to all seven uniformed services
   depending on the health and/or medical needs of the other uniformed
   services. The Corps also recently initiated a transformation to enlarge
   the size of the Corps.

Purpose[edit]

   The stated mission of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health
   Service is "Protecting, promoting, and advancing the health and safety
   of the Nation" in accordance with the Corps four Core Values:
   Leadership, Excellence, Integrity, and Service. Officers execute the
   mission of the Corps in the following ways:
     * Help provide healthcare and related services to medically
       underserved populations: to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and
       to other population groups with special needs;
     * Prevent and control disease, identify health hazards in the
       environment and help correct them, and promote healthy lifestyles
       for the nation's citizens;
     * Improve the nation's mental health;
     * Ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective, food
       is safe and wholesome, cosmetics are harmless, and that electronic
       products do not expose users to dangerous amounts of radiation;
     * Conduct and support biomedical, behavioral, and health services
       research and communicate research results to health professionals
       and the public; and
     * Work with other nations and international agencies on global health
       problems and their solutions.

   In addition, the Corps provides officers (Medical Officers, Dental
   Officers, Therapists, Environmental Health Officers, etc.) to other
   uniformed services, primarily the United States Coast Guard and the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer
   Corps. Corps officers may also be detailed to other federal agencies
   including the Department of Defense, TRICARE, Department of Justice
   (BOP), State Department, Department of Homeland Security, Department of
   the Interior (National Park Service), and even the Central Intelligence
   Agency. Corps officers may also develop individual memoranda of
   understanding (MOUs) with other organizations, including state and
   local health agencies, and even non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

   The Commissioned Corps is also often called upon by other federal,
   state, and local agencies to aid and augment in times when their
   resources are overwhelmed. These responses are
   considered^[weasel words] deployments, and may be for technical needs
   in standard settings, or in the event of disasters, in austere
   environments.

Deployments[edit]

   The corps is often deployed as part of ESF-8 in the national emergency
   response plan, but can also be deployed on an individual basis for
   various needs to other federal agencies, states, local governments, or
   even to aid foreign governments. Like all other federal-level
   responses, officers are deployed only upon request, and upon the
   recommendation of the Surgeon General and permission of the Assistant
   Secretary for Health. During deployments, officers may report to
   regular office spaces, such as coordinating responses at
   state-of-the-art emergency operations centers, or into the field in
   extremely austere environments, such as when responding to a natural
   disaster. In addition, deployments may either be on an individual
   basis, such as when specific skill sets are needed, or as part of a
   team, when large-scale responses are needed.

   The Corps recently introduced a tiered system of response, with Tier 1
   response teams ready and able to respond to an event within 12 hours,
   and Tier 2 teams ready and able to respond within 36 hours. Officers
   not on Tier 1 or 2 teams are Tier 3 responders, ready and able to
   respond to an event in 72 hours. Tier 1 teams are primarily made up of
   Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) teams that are made up of over 100
   officers with multiple specialties, and are focused on providing acute
   clinical care of disaster-exacerbated chronic conditions. Officers who
   do not work as a clinical care provider on one of these teams are often
   in support roles, such as logistics, administration/finance, or
   planning. Tier 2 teams are composed of a smaller, more specialized
   workforce. Current Tier 2 teams include the Applied Public Health Team
   (APHT), the Mental Health Team (MHT), and the Services Access Team
   (SAT). Officers not already assigned to one of the Tier 1 and Tier 2
   teams are Tier 3, and are used to augment these teams in the event of
   staffing shortages due to availability, or the need to scale up a
   response.

   Some notable recent deployments involving the Public Health Service
   Commissioned Corps:
     * 1989 - Hurricane Hugo, Loma Prieta, California
       earthquake.^[citation needed]
     * 1992 - More than 1000 PHS officers were deployed to South Dade
       County, Florida following Hurricane Andrew
     * early 1990s - flooding throughout the United States and Alaska
     * 1994 - Northridge, California earthquake
     * 1995 - bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
       Oklahoma.
     * 1995 - Hundreds of PHS officers were deployed to the U.S. Virgin
       Islands following Hurricane Marilyn
     * 2001 - More than 1,000 PHS officers were deployed to New York City
       after the attacks on September 11, 2001 to aid victims and provide
       medical and mental health services to responders and rescue
       workers.
     * 2004 - Hurricane Ivan
     * 2005 - more than 2,000 PHS officers deployed to set up field
       hospitals and render aid and assistance to evacuees and responders
       in the wakes of Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and Hurricane
       Wilma^[9]
     * 2008 - PHS-2 Rapid Deployment Force deployed pre-landfall to
       Louisiana in advance of Hurricane Gustav. It became the first
       standing PHS team to set up and run a Federal Medical Station. The
       team and 200 patients rode out the hurricane in Alexandria's
       Riverfront Center. RDF-1 and RDF-3 deployed pre-landfall in advance
       of Hurricane Ike to set up Federal Medical Stations in College
       Station, TX and Baton Rouge, LA respectively.
     * 2010 - Haiti earthquake; oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
     * 2012 - Hurricane Sandy^[10]
     * 2014 - Unaccompanied Minor Children immigration crisis; Ebola
       outbreak response^[11]

   In addition to disaster response, the Public Health Service
   Commissioned Corps has been partnering with the United States Navy on
   their health diplomacy missions. Corps officers have been part of the
   Navy's Pacific Partnership (in the Pacific basin) and Continuing
   Promise (in the Caribbean/west Atlantic) since 2007. Such missions are
   often carried out on either the USNS Mercy (T-AH-19) or
   USNS Comfort (T-AH-20), though other ships, such as the
   USS Bataan (LHD-5) have also been used. The command staff of the corps
   are deployed for the entire mission duration (often three months),
   while operational personnel serve one month aboard, meeting and
   departing the ships at the ports of call during the mission.

   The corps, as a uniformed service, may also be militarized and
   considered a branch of the armed forces by an act of Congress, or by
   executive order by the President of the United States, not only in time
   of war, but also in “an emergency involving the national defense
   proclaimed by the President." One such major militarization of the
   corps occurred during World War II, in which the corps was militarized
   for WWII and the Korean War.^[12]

   The members of the Commissioned Corps number over 6,600 officers in 11
   professional categories:
     * Dentist
     * Dietitian
     * Engineer
     * Environmental health officers
     * Health service officers
     * Nurse
     * Medical
     * Pharmacist
     * Scientist
     * Therapist (including physical, occupational, speech)
     * Veterinarian

   The Health Services Officer (HSO) category comprises over 50
   specialties, including audiology, social workers, physician assistants,
   optometrists, statisticians, computer scientists, dental hygienists,
   medical records administrators, medical technologists and others.

   The Corps uses the same commissioned officer ranks as the United States
   Navy and Coast Guard from ensign to admiral, uniformed services pay
   grades O-1 through O-10 respectively. USPHS Commissioned Corps officers
   are appointed via direct commission and receive the same pay as other
   members of the uniformed services. They cannot hold a dual commission
   with another service but inter-service transfers are permitted.

Warrant officers[edit]

   The Corps is authorized to use warrant officer ranks W-1 to W-4 under
   the U.S. Code of law,^[14] but does not currently use these ranks.

   PHSCC Insignia

   Corps officers wear uniforms similar to those of the United States Navy
   with special PHSCC insignia. In certain duty situations, a PHSCC
   officer can be allocated to another uniformed service. For example, the
   NOAA Corps do not commission medical officers on board ship so the
   PHSCC allocates officers to them. The PHSCC also allocates and details
   a number of officers to the United States Coast Guard. Because of this
   close relationship, if a PHSCC officer is on assignment with the Coast
   Guard, the officer is required to wear the same service uniforms as
   regular Coast Guard officers, but still bearing PHSCC insignia to
   identify them. The PHSCC officer is also subject to grooming standards
   of the service to which attached for uniform appearance.

March of the United States Public Health Service[edit]

   Like the other U.S. uniformed services, the U.S. Public Health Service
   has a march and accompanying lyrics. Composed by retired U.S. Coast
   Guard Senior Chief Musician George King III, the lyrics are as follows:

   The mission of our service is known the world around
   In research and in treatment no equal can be found
   In the silent war against disease no truce is ever seen
   We serve on the land and the sea for humanity
   The Public Health Service Team^[15]
