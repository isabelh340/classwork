   Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the
   writings of Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws where he urged for a
   constitutional government with three separate branches of government.
   Each of the three branches would have defined abilities to check the
   powers of the other branches. This idea was called separation of
   powers. This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United
   States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and
   Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in
   order to prevent abuse of power. This United States form of separation
   of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.

   During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as John Locke
   advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as
   Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost
   supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the
   judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the opinions of the
   framers of the United States Constitution.

   Strict separation of powers does not operate in The United Kingdom, the
   political structure of which served in most instances as a model for
   the government created by the U.S. Constitution. Under the UK
   Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible
   government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign
   (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the
   supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of
   the King ("His Majesty's Government"), as did the judiciary. The King's
   Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of
   Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a
   majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor,
   was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the
   presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that
   the three branches of British government often violated the strict
   principle of separation of powers, even though there were many
   occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with
   each other.

   Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the
   18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member
   of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house
   of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member
   of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of
   the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice
   Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive
   council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many
   southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland,
   Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of
   government "separate and distinct."

Legislative power[edit]

   Seal of the United States Congress.svg

   Congress has the sole power to legislate for the United States. Under
   the nondelegation doctrine, Congress may not delegate its lawmaking
   responsibilities to any other agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court
   held in the 1998 case Clinton v. City of New York that Congress could
   not delegate a "line-item veto" to the President, by powers vested in
   the government by the Constitution.

   Where Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its
   authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the
   earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was Wayman
   v. Southard 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 42 (1825). Congress had delegated to
   the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended
   that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with
   legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the
   determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he
   distinguished between "important" subjects and mere details. Marshall
   wrote that "a general provision may be made, and power given to those
   who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details."

   Marshall's words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude
   in delegating powers. It was not until the 1930s that the Supreme Court
   held a delegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving
   the creation of the National Recovery Administration called A.L.A.
   Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), Congress
   could not authorize the president to formulate codes of "fair
   competition." It was held that Congress must set some standards
   governing the actions of executive officers. The Court, however, has
   deemed that phrases such as "just and reasonable," "public interest"
   and "public convenience" suffice.

Executive power[edit]

   note: It seems that some editors have taken it upon themselves to make
   the President a subordinate to Congress, and to use this section not to
   describe powers of the Executive, but rather another section for
   describing Congressional powers over the Executive branch, even so far
   as to suggest that Congress can pass regulatory laws over the Executive
   branch without approval of the President.
   Seal of the President of the United States.svg

   Executive power is vested, with exceptions and qualifications,^[1] in
   the President. By law (Section 2.) the president becomes the Commander
   in Chief of the Army and Navy, Militia of several states when called
   into service, has power to make treaties and appointments to office
   "with the Advice and Consent of the Senate," receive Ambassadors and
   Public Ministers, and "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"
   (Section 3.) By using these words, the Constitution does not require
   the president to personally enforce the law; rather, officers
   subordinate to the president may perform such duties. The Constitution
   empowers the president to ensure the faithful execution of the laws
   made by Congress and approved by the President. Congress may itself
   terminate such appointments, by impeachment, and restrict the
   president. Bodies such as the War Claims Commission, the Interstate
   Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission—all
   quasi-judicial—often have direct Congressional oversight.

   Congress often writes legislation to restrain executive officials to
   the performance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress
   passes. In INS v. Chadha (1983), the Supreme Court decided (a) The
   prescription for legislative action in Art. I, § 1—requiring all
   legislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate
   and a House of Representatives—and § 7—requiring every bill passed by
   the House and Senate, before becoming law, to be presented to the
   president, and, if he disapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the
   Senate and House—represents the Framers' decision that the legislative
   power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single,
   finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure. This procedure is
   an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of
   powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses acting
   together cannot override Executive vetos without a ^2⁄[3] majority.
   Legislation may always prescribe regulations governing executive
   officers.

   The Executive Branch is also the dominant voice of the United States in
   foreign affairs.

Judicial power[edit]

   Seal of the United States Supreme Court.svg

   Template:See also I and Article III tribunals

   Judicial power—the power to decide cases and controversies—is vested in
   the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by Congress. The
   judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent
   of the Senate, hold office during good behavior and receive
   compensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in
   office. If a court's judges do not have such attributes, the court may
   not exercise the judicial power of the United States. Courts exercising
   the judicial power are called "constitutional courts."

   Congress may establish "legislative courts," which do not take the form
   of judicial agencies or commissions, whose members do not have the same
   security of tenure or compensation as the constitutional court judges.
   Legislative courts may not exercise the judicial power of the United
   States. In Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. (1856),
   the Supreme Court held that a legislative court may not decide "a suit
   at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty," as such a suit is
   inherently judicial. Legislative courts may only adjudicate "public
   rights" questions (cases between the government and an individual and
   political determinations).

Checks and balances[edit]

   Legislative

     * Writes and enacts laws
     * Enacts taxes, authorizes borrowing, and sets the budget
     * Has sole power to declare war
     * May start investigations, especially against the executive branch
     * The Senate considers presidential appointments of judges and
       executive department heads
     * The Senate ratifies treaties
     * The House of Representatives may impeach, and the Senate may
       remove, executive and judicial officers
     * Sets up federal courts except the Supreme Court, and sets the
       number of justices on the Supreme Court
     * May override presidential vetoes

   Executive

     * May veto laws
     * Wages war at the direction of Congress (Congress makes the rules
       for the military)
     * Makes decrees or declarations (for example, declaring a state of
       emergency) and promulgates lawful regulations and executive orders
     * Influences other branches of its agenda with the State of the Union
       address.
     * Appoints judges and executive department heads
     * Has power to grant pardons to convicted persons, except in cases of
       impeachment

   Judicial

     * Determines which laws Congress intended to apply to any given case
     * Determines whether a law is unconstitutional. However, this is not
       a power given in the constitution. It was 'created' in Marbury v
       Madison (1803)
     * Determines how Congress meant the law to apply to disputes
     * Determines how a law acts to determine the disposition of prisoners
     * Determines how a law acts to compel testimony and the production of
       evidence
     * Determines how laws should be interpreted to assure uniform
       policies in a top-down fashion via the appeals process, but gives
       discretion in individual cases to low-level judges. (The amount of
       discretion depends upon the standard of review, determined by the
       type of case in question.)
     * Polices its own members

Executive[edit]

   The president exercises a check over Congress through his power to veto
   bills, but Congress may override any veto (excluding the so-called
   "pocket veto") by a two-thirds majority in each house. When the two
   houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the
   president may settle the dispute. Either house or both houses may be
   called into emergency session by the president. The Vice President
   serves as president of the Senate, but he may only vote to break a tie.

   The president, as noted above, appoints judges with the Senate's advice
   and consent. He also has the power to issue pardons and reprieves. Such
   pardons are not subject to confirmation by either the House of
   Representatives or the Senate, or even to acceptance by the recipient.

   The president is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy
   of the United States. It is generally understood that he has the
   authority to command them to take appropriate military action in the
   event of a sudden crisis.^[2] However, only the Congress is explicitly
   granted the power to declare war per se, as well as to raise, fund and
   maintain the armed forces. Congress also has the duty and authority to
   prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces
   operate, such as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and requires
   that all Generals and Admirals appointed by the president be confirmed
   by a majority vote of the Senate before they can assume their office.

Judicial[edit]

   Courts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch
   through judicial review. This concept is not written into the
   Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers
   (for example, the Federalist Papers mention it). The Supreme Court
   established a precedent for judicial review in Marbury v. Madison.
   There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political
   expediency, but political realities in the particular case
   paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For
   this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may
   strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.

   A common misperception is that the Supreme Court is the only court that
   may determine constitutionality; the power is exercised even by the
   inferior courts. But only Supreme Court decisions are binding across
   the nation. Decisions of a Court of Appeals, for instance, are binding
   only in the circuit over which the court has jurisdiction.

   The power to review the constitutionality of laws may be limited by
   Congress, which has the power to set the jurisdiction of the courts.
   The only constitutional limit on Congress' power to set the
   jurisdiction of the judiciary relates to the Supreme Court; the Supreme
   Court may exercise only appellate jurisdiction except in cases
   involving states and cases affecting foreign ambassadors, ministers or
   consuls.

   The Chief Justice presides in the Senate during a president's
   impeachment trial. The rules of the Senate, however, generally do not
   grant much authority to the presiding officer. Thus, the Chief
   Justice's role in this regard is a limited one.

Equality of the branches[edit]

   The Constitution does not explicitly indicate the pre-eminence of any
   particular branch of government. However, James Madison wrote in
   Federalist 51, regarding the ability of each branch to defend itself
   from actions by the others, that "it is not possible to give to each
   department an equal power of self-defense. In republican government,
   the legislative authority necessarily predominates."

   One may claim that the judiciary has historically been the weakest of
   the three branches. In fact, its power to exercise judicial review—its
   sole meaningful check on the other two branches—is not explicitly
   granted by the U.S Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court exercised its
   power to strike down congressional acts as unconstitutional only twice
   prior to the Civil War: in Marbury v. Madison (1803) and Dred Scott v.
   Sandford (1857). While the Supreme Court has since then made more
   extensive use of judicial review, it cannot be said to have as much
   political power as either Congress or the President.

   Throughout America's history dominance of one of the three branches has
   essentially been a see-saw struggle between congress and the president.
   Both have had periods of great power and weakness such as immediately
   after the Civil War when republicans had a majority in congress and
   were able to pass major legislation and shoot down most of the
   president's vetoes. They also passed acts to essentially make the
   president subordinate to congress, such as the Tenure of Office Act.
   Johnson's later impeachment also cost the presidency much political
   power. However the president has also exercised greater power largely
   during the 20th century. Both Roosevelts greatly expanded the powers of
   the president and wielded great power during their terms. Johnson and
   Nixon during the 1960s and 1970s exploited the presidency particularly
   Nixon.

   The first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive
   use of the veto power: George Washington only vetoed two bills, James
   Monroe one, and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams
   none. James Madison, a firm believer in a strong executive, vetoed
   seven bills. None of the first six Presidents, however, used the veto
   to direct national policy. It was Andrew Jackson, the seventh
   President, who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon.
   During his two terms in office, he vetoed twelve bills—more than all of
   his predecessors combined. Furthermore, he defied the Supreme Court in
   enforcing the policy of ethnically cleansing Native American tribes
   ("Indian Removal"); he stated (perhaps apocryphally), "John Marshall
   has made his decision. Now let him enforce it!"

   Some of Jackson's successors made no use of the veto power, while
   others used it intermittently. It was only after the Civil War that
   presidents began to use the power to truly counterbalance Congress.
   Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, vetoed several Reconstruction bills passed
   by the "Radical Republicans." Congress, however, managed to override
   fifteen of Johnson's twenty-nine vetoes. Furthermore, it attempted to
   curb the power of the presidency by passing the Tenure of Office Act.
   The Act required Senate approval for the dismissal of senior Cabinet
   officials. When Johnson deliberately violated the Act, which he felt
   was unconstitutional (Supreme Court decisions later vindicated such a
   position), the House of Representatives impeached him; he was acquitted
   in the Senate by one vote.
   Grover Cleveland worked to restore power to the Presidency after Andrew
   Johnson's impeachment.

   Johnson's impeachment was perceived to have done great damage to the
   presidency, which came to be almost subordinate to Congress. Some
   believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the
   Speaker of the House of Representatives becoming a de facto Prime
   Minister. Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President following
   Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first
   term, he vetoed over four hundred bills—twice as many bills as his
   twenty-one predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats
   who were appointed as a result of the patronage system, replacing them
   with more "deserving" individuals. The Senate, however, refused to
   confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn
   over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland
   steadfastly refused, asserting, "These suspensions are my executive
   acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to
   submit my actions to them for judgment." Cleveland's popular support
   forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore,
   Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that
   had been passed during the Johnson Administration. Overall, this meant
   that Cleveland's Administration marked the end of presidential
   subordination.

   Several twentieth-century presidents have attempted to greatly expand
   the power of the presidency. Theodore Roosevelt, for instance, claimed
   that the president was permitted to do whatever was not explicitly
   prohibited by the law—in direct contrast to his immediate successor,
   William Howard Taft. Franklin Delano Roosevelt held considerable power
   during the Great Depression. Congress had granted Franklin Roosevelt
   sweeping authority; in Panama Refining v. Ryan, the Court for the first
   time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as violative of
   the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned Schechter
   Poultry Corp. v. United States, another separation of powers case, was
   also decided during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. In response to
   many unfavorable Supreme Court decisions, Roosevelt introduced a “Court
   Packing” plan, under which more seats would be added to the Supreme
   Court for the president to fill. Such a plan (which was defeated in
   Congress) would have seriously undermined the judiciary's independence
   and power.

   Richard Nixon—whose presidency is sometimes described as "Imperial"
   (see Imperial Presidency)—used national security as a basis for his
   expansion of power. He asserted, for example, that "the inherent power
   of the President to safeguard the security of the nation" authorized
   him to order a wiretap without a judge's warrant. Nixon also asserted
   that "executive privilege" shielded him from all legislative oversight;
   furthermore, he impounded federal funds (that is to say, he refused to
   spend money that Congress had appropriated for government programs). In
   the specific cases aforementioned, however, the Supreme Court ruled
   against Nixon. This was also because of an ongoing criminal
   investigation into the Watergate tapes, even though they acknowledged
   the general need for executive privilege. Since then, Nixon's
   successors have sometimes asserted that they may act in the interests
   of national security or that executive privilege shields them from
   Congressional oversight. Though such claims have in general been more
   limited than Nixon's, one may still conclude that the presidency's
   power has been greatly augmented since the eighteenth and nineteenth
   centuries.

Views on separation of powers[edit]

   Many political scientists believe that separation of powers is a
   decisive factor in what they see as a limited degree of American
   exceptionalism. In particular, John W. Kingdon made this argument,
   claiming that separation of powers contributed to the development of a
   unique political structure in the United States. He attributes the
   unusually large number of interest groups active in the United States,
   in part, to the separation of powers; it gives groups more places to
   try to influence, and creates more potential group activity. He also
   cites its complexity as one of the reasons for lower citizen
   participation.

Judicial independence[edit]

   Separation of powers has again become a current issue of some
   controversy concerning debates about judicial independence and
   political efforts to increase the accountability of judges for the
   quality of their work, avoiding conflicts of interest, and charges that
   some judges allegedly disregard procedural rules, statutes, and higher
   court precedents.

   It is said^[by whom?] on one side of this debate that separation of
   powers means that powers are shared among different branches; no one
   branch may act unilaterally on issues (other than perhaps minor
   questions), but must obtain some form of agreement across branches.
   That is, it is argued that "checks and balances" apply to the Judicial
   branch as well as to the other branches.

   It is said^[by whom?] on the other side of this debate that separation
   of powers means that the Judiciary is independent and untouchable
   within the Judiciaries' sphere. In this view, separation of powers
   means that the Judiciary alone holds all powers relative to the
   Judicial function, and that the Legislative and Executive branches may
   not interfere in any aspect of the Judicial branch.

   An example of the first view is the regulation of attorneys and judges,
   and the establishment of rules for the conduct of the courts, by the
   Congress and in the states the legislatures. Although in practice these
   matters are delegated to the Supreme Court, the Congress holds these
   powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in
   light of the Supreme Court's expertise, but can withdraw that
   delegation at any time.

   An example of the second view at the State level is found in the view
   of the Florida Supreme Court, that only the Florida Supreme Court may
   license and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of Florida,
   and only the Florida Supreme Court may set rules for procedures in the
   Florida courts. The State of New Hampshire also follows this system.
