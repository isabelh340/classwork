United States federal executive departments

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   The United States federal executive departments are among the oldest
   primary units of the executive branch of the federal government of the
   United States—the Departments of State, War, and the Treasury all
   having been established within a few weeks of each other in 1789.

   Federal executive departments are analogous to ministries common in
   parliamentary or semi-presidential systems but, with the United States
   being a presidential system, their heads otherwise equivalent to
   ministers, do not form a government (in a parliamentary sense) nor are
   they led by a head of government separate from the head of state. The
   heads of the federal executive departments, known as secretaries of
   their respective department, form the traditional Cabinet of the United
   States, an executive organ that serves at the disposal of the president
   and normally act as an advisory body to the presidency.

   Since 1792, by statutory specification, the cabinet constituted a line
   of succession to the presidency, after the Speaker of the House and the
   president pro tempore of the Senate, in the event of a vacancy in both
   the presidency and the vice presidency. The Constitution refers to
   these officials when it authorizes the President, in Article II,
   section 2, to "require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal
   Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating
   to the Duties of their respective Offices." In brief, they and their
   organizations are the administrative arms of the President.
