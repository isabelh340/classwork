State constitution (United States)

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   In the United States, each state has its own constitution.

   Usually, they are longer than the 8,500-word federal Constitution and
   are more detailed regarding the day-to-day relationships between
   government and the people. The shortest is the Constitution of Vermont,
   adopted in 1793 and currently 8,295 words long. The longest is
   Alabama's sixth and current constitution, ratified in 1901, at 357,157
   words long. Both the federal and state constitutions are organic texts:
   they are the fundamental blueprints for the legal and political
   organizations of the United States and the states, respectively.

   The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, part of the Bill
   of Rights, provides that "The powers not delegated to the United States
   by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
   to the States respectively, or to the people." The Guarantee Clause of
   Article 4 of the Constitution states that "The United States shall
   guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of
   Government." These two provisions indicate states did not surrender
   their wide latitude to adopt a constitution, the fundamental documents
   of state law, when the U.S. Constitution was adopted.

   Typically state constitutions address a wide array of issues deemed by
   the states to be of sufficient importance to be included in the
   constitution rather than in an ordinary statute. Often modeled after
   the federal Constitution, they outline the structure of the state
   government and typically establish a bill of rights, an executive
   branch headed by a governor (and often one or more other officials,
   such as a lieutenant governor and state attorney general), a state
   legislature, and state courts, including a state supreme court (a few
   states have two high courts, one for civil cases, the other for
   criminal cases). Additionally, many other provisions may be included.
   Many state constitutions, unlike the federal constitution, also begin
   with an invocation of God.

   Some states allow amendments to the Constitution by initiative.

   Many states have had several constitutions over the course of its
   history.

   The organized territories of the United States also have constitutions
   or organic acts of their own, if they have an organized government
   through an Organic Act passed by the federal Congress. These
   constitutions are subject to congressional approval and oversight,
   which is not the case with state constitutions. If territories wish to
   enter the Union (that is, to attain statehood), they seek an enabling
   act from Congress and must draft an acceptable state constitution as a
   prerequisite to statehood.

Federal district charter[edit]

   No. Official name Date of effect Notes
   1st District of Columbia, Charter of theCharter of the District of
   Columbia 01973-12-24-0000December 24, 1973

   The District of Columbia (Washington City in the District of Columbia)
   has a charter similar to charters of major cities, instead of having a
   constitution like the states and territories. The District of Columbia
   Home Rule Act establishes the Council of the District of Columbia which
   governs the entire district and has certain devolved powers similar to
   those of major cities. Congress has full authority over the district
   and may amend the charter and any legislation enacted by the Council.
   Attempts at statehood for the District of Columbia have included the
   drafting of two constitutions in 1982^[11] and 1987^[12] respectively
   referring to the district as the State of New Columbia.

Territorial constitutions[edit]

     * 1st Constitution of the Territory of American Samoa, July 1, 1967
       (at Politics of American Samoa) The revised constitution was
       approved on June 2, 1967 by Stewart L. Udall, then U.S. Secretary
       of the Interior, under authority granted on June 29, 1951. It
       became effective on July 1, 1967.
     * 1st Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
       Islands, November 3, 1986. The Constitution was approved by the
       Congress of the United States by joint resolution approved March
       24, 1976 (Public Law 94-241; 90 Stat. 263) and by a majority of the
       voters of American Samoa voting in the general election in
       1966.^[13]
     * 1st Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, July 25, 1952.
       It was ratified by Puerto Rico's electorate in a referendum on
       March 3, 1952, approved by the United States Congress and the
       President

Organic acts[edit]

     * The Territory of Guam does not have its own constitution, but
       operates under the Guam Organic Act of 1950 and other federal
       statutes.
     * The United States Virgin Islands, an unincorporated organized
       territory, does not have its own constitution, instead operating
       under various federal statutes. See politics of the United States
       Virgin Islands.
