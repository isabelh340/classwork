   A Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution,
   also called an Article V Convention, or Amendments Convention, is one
   of two procedures for proposing amendments to the United States
   Constitution described in Article Five of the Constitution. The other
   method is a vote by two-thirds of each house of Congress.

   In recent years some constitutional scholars have argued that state
   governments should call for such a convention.^[1]^[2] They include
   Lawrence Lessig, Sanford Levinson, Larry Sabato, Jonathan Turley, and
   Mark Levin.^[1]^[3]^[4] As of 2014, there is an active nationwide
   effort to call an Article V Convention. Citizens for Self-Governance,
   through a project called Convention of the States, is promoting Article
   V legislation in all 50 states. In March 2014, Georgia became the first
   state to pass the group's Convention of States application.^[5] Alaska
   and Florida followed suit in April 2014.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   Similarly, the group Wolf-PAC chose this method to promote its cause.
   Their resolution passed first in Vermont^[11] in May 2014 and a month
   later in California; as of late June 2014, Wolf-PAC's resolution is
   still pending in eight other states.

   According to Article V, Congress must call for an amendment-proposing
   convention, “on the application of the Legislatures of two thirds of
   the several States," meaning 34 state legislatures would have to submit
   applications. Once an Article V Convention has proposed an amendment or
   amendments, then the amendment or amendments would have to be ratified
   by three-fourths of the states (38 states) in order to become part of
   the Constitution.

   Congress has the power to choose between two methods of ratification:
   ratification by the state legislatures, or instead ratification by
   state conventions called for that purpose. In contrast to those
   separate state ratification conventions, a convention to propose
   amendments to the United States Constitution would be a single federal
   convention. While there have been calls for a second federal convention
   based on a single issue such as the Balanced Budget Amendment, it is
   not clear whether a convention summoned in this way would be legally
   bound to limit discussion to a single issue; law professor Michael
   Stokes Paulsen has suggested that such a convention would have the
   "power to propose anything it sees fit".^[12] All 27 amendments to the
   Constitution have happened in a procedural sense by going through
   Congress and not through proposal by state legislatures.^[12]

History[edit]

   A painting depicting the signing of the original United States
   Constitution.

   To guard against oppressive government of any kind, the authors of the
   United States Constitution sought to establish institutional checks and
   balances. In framing the Constitution as the fundamental embodiment of
   such safeguards, the Constitutional Convention assembled in
   Philadelphia in 1787,^[13] at the invitation of the Continental
   Congress.^[14] That is the last time a federal constitutional
   convention was convened in the United States.

Creation of the amendment process[edit]

   One of the main reasons for the 1787 Convention was that the Articles
   of Confederation required the unanimous consent of all 13 states for
   the national government to take action. This system had proved
   unworkable, and the newly written Constitution sought to address this
   problem.

   The first proposal for a method of amending the Constitution offered in
   the Constitutional Convention, contained in the Virginia Plan, sought
   to circumvent the national legislature, stating that "the assent of the
   National Legislature ought not to be required."^[15] In response,
   Alexander Hamilton privately circulated a proposal that gave the power
   to propose amendments to the national legislature, and the power to
   ratify the amendments to the states.^[16]

   James Madison did not oppose reintroducing language permitting the
   convention amendment process, although he did express concerns about
   the lack of detail in Article V regarding how the convention amendment
   process would work. Madison stated that "difficulties might arise as to
   the form" a convention would take.^[17]

   After some debate, Madison removed reference to the convention
   amendment process, giving the national legislature sole authority to
   propose amendments whenever it thought necessary or when two-thirds of
   the states applied to the national legislature.^[18] Several delegates
   voiced opposition to the idea of the national legislature retaining
   sole power to propose constitutional amendments.^[19] George Mason
   argued from the floor of the Convention that it "would be improper to
   require the consent of the Natl. Legislature, because they may abuse
   their power, and refuse their consent on that very account." Mason
   added that, "no amendments of the proper kind would ever be obtained by
   the people, if the Government should become oppressive."^[20] In
   response to these concerns, the Convention unanimously voted to add the
   language allowing states to apply to Congress for a convention to
   propose amendments to the Constitution.^[19]

Permissible scope of applications to Congress[edit]

   A frequent question is whether applications from the states can omit to
   mention subject matter, and instead request an unlimited convention.
   Past practice suggests that separate unlimited applications submitted
   to Congress at different times are not allowed.^[21] Article V itself
   calls for "the application of the legislatures" instead of calling for
   plural "applications".

   States have requested that Congress convene an Article V convention to
   propose amendments on a variety of subjects. According to the National
   Archives, Congress has, however, never officially tabulated the
   applications, nor separated them by subject matter.^[22] On at least
   one occasion though, the Congressional Record has included such a
   tabulation, which indicated that, as of 22 September 1981^[update],
   thirty states had made a request for a balanced budget amendment.^[23]
   In 1993, Professor Michael Paulsen and his research staff assembled a
   listing of all state applications to date, but neither Paulsen's list,
   nor any other, can be safely characterized as "complete" since there
   may very well be state applications that have been overlooked and/or
   forgotten.^[24]

   According to James Kenneth Rogers, the drafting history of Article V
   indicates that states may limit the subject matter of their
   applications, and that Congress has a duty to tally applications
   separately by subject matter.^[19] Moreover, Rogers asserts that states
   may not make a general application without specifying the subject or
   subjects to be addressed by the convention.^[25] Rogers points out
   that, during the drafting process, the Philadelphia Convention at one
   point adopted a version of Article V that gave power to Congress to
   propose amendments when two-thirds of both houses agreed, or to propose
   amendments without a congressional supermajority "on the application of
   two thirds of the Legislatures of the several states."^[26] This draft
   version of Article V lacked any provision for a constitutional
   convention requested by the states, and instead included language
   almost identical to the final version of Article V but giving states
   the power to apply to Congress for amendments without any convention.
   The draft language suggests that states applying to Congress for
   amendments would have to say what sort of amendments they were applying
   for, because a general petition (that is, one not limited by subject
   matter) asking Congress to propose amendments would serve little
   purpose "beyond notifying Congress that two‐thirds of the States
   thought that some unknown changes to the Constitution were
   desirable."^[25] Therefore, due to the similarity between the draft and
   final versions, Rogers contends that state applications to Congress
   must specify subject matter, and must be tallied individually by
   subject matter to determine whether the two-thirds threshold of state
   applications has been met.

   A dissenting view has been expressed by Michael Stokes Paulsen, a
   professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. Paulsen has
   argued that state applications for an Article V convention limited to a
   particular subject matter are invalid and that only applications that
   include a call for an unrestricted convention are valid.^[24] If
   Paulsen's criteria that state applications must not be limited to
   particular subject matter and that rescissions by states are valid, as
   of 1993 a total of forty-five states had pending applications meeting
   this criteria.^[21] According to Paulsen, therefore, Congress has had a
   duty to call a convention for many years. The fact that Congress has
   not called such a convention, and that courts have rejected all
   attempts to force Congress to call a convention, has been cited as
   persuasive evidence that Paulsen's view is incorrect.^[27]

Permissible scope of proposed amendments[edit]

   A serious challenge to the authority of the Constitution happened in
   the mid-nineteenth century, when southern states seceded resulting in
   the American Civil War.

   Because no Article V convention has ever been convened, there are
   various questions about how such a convention would function in
   practice. One major question is whether the scope of the convention's
   subject matter could be limited.^[19]

   The consensus is that Congress probably does not have the power to
   limit a convention to a single amendment or a single subject, because
   the language of Article V leaves no discretion to Congress, merely
   stating that Congress "shall" call a convention when the proper number
   of state applications have been received. Comments made at the time the
   Constitution was adopted indicate that it was understood when the
   Constitution was drafted that Congress would have no discretion. In The
   Federalist, Alexander Hamilton stated that when the proper number of
   applications had been received, Congress was "obliged" to call a
   convention and that "nothing is left to the discretion of
   Congress."^[28] James Madison also affirmed Hamilton's contention that
   Congress was obligated to call a convention when the requisite number
   of states requested it.^[29] In the North Carolina debates about
   ratifying the Constitution, James Iredell, who subsequently became one
   of the founding members of the Supreme Court, stated that when
   two-thirds of states have applied to Congress for a convention,
   Congress is "under the necessity of convening one" and that they have
   "no option."^[30]

   By citing the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress has
   tried to enact a statute to regulate how an Article V convention would
   function. Sponsored by the late Senator Sam Ervin, such a bill passed
   the U.S. Senate unanimously in 1971 and again in 1973, but the proposed
   legislation remained bottled up in the Committee on the Judiciary in
   the U.S. House of Representatives and died both times. Opponents to
   congressional regulation of an Article V convention's operations argue
   that neither Article I nor Article V of the Constitution grants
   Congress this power, and that the Founders intended that Congress "have
   no option." There has been no opportunity for Federal courts to decide
   whether Congress has such authority because such legislation has never
   been adopted by Congress.

   While Congress likely has no authority to limit the scope of an Article
   V convention, some scholars believe that states do have that power.
   Larry J. Sabato is one scholar who advanced that view.^[31] Some feel
   that Congress's duty to call a convention when requested by the states
   means that it must call the convention that the states requested. If
   the states, therefore, request a convention limited to a certain
   subject matter, then the convention that is called would likely need to
   be limited in the way the states requested.^[32]

   If states have the power to limit an Article V convention to a
   particular subject matter, and Congress only has power to call a
   convention but no further power to control or regulate it, then a
   potential concern becomes whether an Article V convention could become
   a "runaway convention" that attempts to exceed its scope. If a
   convention did attempt to exceed its scope, none of the amendments it
   proposed would become part of the constitution until three-fourths of
   the states ratified them, which is more states than are required to
   call a convention in the first place.^[33] Some proponents of a
   convention express doubt that an Article V convention would exceed its
   scope, in light of the United States' experience with state
   constitutional conventions; over 600 state constitutional conventions
   have been held to amend state constitutions, with little evidence that
   any of them have exceeded their scope.^[34]

   Opponents to a convention counter that the only national amendments
   convention, held in 1787, tells a very different story. Of the 12
   states that sent delegates to the 1787 convention, only 2 placed no
   restrictions on the power of their delegates. The other 10 states,
   Congress, and Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation all gave
   very specific restrictions and rules for the convention, yet none of
   these were honored.

   NY, MA and Congress all specifically restricted delegates to “revising”
   the Articles of Confederation. MA & DE said delegates were to protect
   the rights of states to veto constitutional changes and to recall
   congressmen. NH, CT, PA, MD, VA, SC, GA, & Art XIII of the Articles of
   Confederation required all 13 states to ratify any changes. All of
   these were violated.

   The Constitutional Convention of 1787, which gave us the U.S.
   Constitution, was called as a "limited" convention, but ended up not
   being limited.

Ability of states to rescind applications to Congress[edit]

   The legislatures of some states have adopted rescissions of their prior
   applications. It is not clear from the language of Article V whether a
   subsequent vote to rescind an application is permissible. As discussed
   above, however, if the purpose of Article V is to give state
   legislatures power over a recalcitrant Congress—and if state lawmakers
   may indeed limit their applications by specific subject matter—it is
   possible that federal courts would hold that rescissions of previous
   applications are likewise valid, in order to give more meaningful
   effect to the power which Article V confers upon state
   legislators.^[35]

   If it is ultimately adjudicated that a state may not rescind a prior
   application, then Ohio's 2013 application for a Balanced Budget
   Amendment convention would be the 33rd and Michigan's 2014 application
   would be the 34th (out of the necessary 34) on that topic—rather than
   merely the 20th and 22nd, respectively. The Balanced Budget Amendment
   applications by Ohio and Michigan plowed completely new ground for
   those two states. Whereas, the renewed applications from Alabama,
   Florida, Georgia, and New Hampshire, simply re-visited old and familiar
   territory. Those four states applied during the 1970s and then
   rescinded in the period from 1988 to 2010. Then, they changed their
   minds yet again and re-applied from 2010 to 2014 for a Balanced Budget
   Amendment convention. Again, if states may not rescind, then with
   Michigan's actions of March 26, 2014, the threshold of 34 states that
   Article V requires for triggering a convention on the subject of a
   Balanced Budget Amendment has now been met.

Supreme Court interpretations of Article V[edit]

   While the Supreme Court has never definitively interpreted the meaning
   of Article V, it has, on four separate occasions, referred to the
   Article V convention process:

   Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. 331 (1855): “[The people] have directed that
   amendments should be made representatively for them, by the Congress .
   . . ; or where the legislatures of two thirds of the several States
   shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either
   case, become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the
   constitution, when ratified. . . .”

   Hawke v. Smith, 253 U.S. 221 (1920): “[Article V] makes provision for
   the proposal of amendments either by two-thirds of both houses of
   Congress or on application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the
   states; thus securing deliberation and consideration before any change
   can be proposed.”

   Dillon v. Gloss 256 U.S. 368 (1921): In discussing Congress's power to
   propose amendments, the Court affirmed that “[a] further mode of
   proposal—as yet never invoked—is provided, which is, that on the
   application of two thirds of the states Congress shall call a
   convention for the purpose.”

   United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716 (1931): “[A]rticle 5 is clear in
   statement and in meaning, contains no ambiguity and calls for no resort
   to rules of construction. . . . It provides two methods for proposing
   amendments. Congress may propose them by a vote of two-thirds of both
   houses, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the
   States, must call a convention to propose them.”

   Because of the political question doctrine and the Court's ruling in
   the 1939 case of Coleman v. Miller (307 U.S. 433), it remains an open
   question whether federal courts could assert jurisdiction over a legal
   challenge to Congress, if Congress were to refuse to call a convention.

Attempts to call an Article V convention[edit]

   Main article: List of state applications for an Article V Convention
   Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has called for a Second
   Constitutional Convention of the United States.^[1]

   Every state except Hawaii has applied for an Article V Convention at
   one time or another. The majority of such applications were made in the
   20th century. While there is no official count of the number of
   applications, one private count puts the total number of applications
   at over 700.^[36]^[37]

   Even though the Article V Convention process has never been used to
   amend the Constitution, the number of states applying for a convention
   has nearly reached the required threshold several times. Congress has
   proposed amendments to the Constitution on several occasions, at least
   in part, because of the threat of an Article V Convention. Rather than
   risk such a convention taking control of the amendment process away
   from it, Congress acted pre-emptively to propose the amendments
   instead. At least four amendments (the Seventeenth, Twenty-First,
   Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments) have been identified as
   being proposed by Congress at least partly in response to the threat of
   an Article V convention.^[38]

1960s[edit]

   There have been two nearly successful attempts to amend the
   Constitution via an Article V Convention since the late 1960s. The
   first try was an attempt to propose an amendment that would overturn
   two Supreme Court decisions, Wesberry v. Sanders and Reynolds v. Sims,
   decisions that required states to adhere to the one man, one vote
   principle in drawing electoral districts for state and federal
   elections. The attempt fell only one state short of reaching the 34
   needed to force Congress to call a convention in 1969, but ended by the
   death of its main promoter Senator Everett Dirksen. After this peak,
   several states rescinded their applications, and interest in the
   proposed amendment subsided.^[39]

1970s and 1980s[edit]

   The next nearly successful attempt to call a convention was in the late
   1970s and 1980s, in response to the ballooning federal deficit. States
   began applying to Congress for an Article V Convention to propose a
   balanced budget amendment. By 1983, the number of applications had
   reached 32, only two states short of the 34 needed to force such a
   convention.^[40] Enthusiasm for the amendment subsided in response to
   fears that an Article V Convention could not be limited to a single
   subject and because Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,
   which required that the budget be balanced by 1991 (but that Act was
   overturned by the Supreme Court in 1986). ^[40]

2010s[edit]

Wolf PAC[edit]

   A political action committee called Wolf PAC emerged from New York's
   Occupy Wall Street movement in October 2011. Wolf PAC calls for a
   convention of states in order to propose a constitutional amendment
   that would ban corporations and unions from spending money on
   elections, and institute a system of public financing.^[41]^[42]

   On May 2, 2014, after an effort by Wolf PAC, the Vermont legislature
   passed a resolution calling for an Article V convention to address the
   issue of money in politics.^[43]

   On June 23, 2014, California became the second state in the nation to
   pass Wolf PAC's resolution.^[44]

Balanced Budget Amendment[edit]

   On November 20, 2013, the Ohio General Assembly applied to Congress for
   a convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment. This effort made
   Ohio the 20th state to join a push for a national convention of
   states.^[45]

   On March 26, 2014, the Michigan Legislature applied to Congress for a
   convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment, making Michigan the
   22nd to participate in the national effort. If it is ultimately
   adjudicated that a state may not rescind a prior application, then the
   threshold of 34 states that Article V requires for triggering a
   convention has now been met.^[46]

Others[edit]

   A group called Citizens for Self-Governance (CSG) is actively engaged
   in an effort to call an Article V Convention. Through an initiative
   called Convention of States, CSG is seeking "to urge and empower state
   legislators to call a convention of states." CSG states that it
   initiated the Convention of States project "for the purpose of stopping
   the runaway power of the federal government."^[47]^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51]
   Mark Levin has supported CSG's efforts to a call a second
   constitutional convention.^[51]

   Single Subject Amendment, a Super PAC registered with the Federal
   Election Commission on March 1, 2013, is actively engaged in an effort
   to call an Article V Convention to propose a constitutional amendment
   to provide that Congress shall pass no bill and no bill shall become
   law which embraces more than one subject.^[52]

   In December 2013, nearly 100 legislators from 32 states met at Mount
   Vernon to talk about how to call a convention of states. According to
   Slate, "The meeting lasted four hours, ending when legislators agreed
   to meet again in the spring of 2014. That’s the most progress anyone’s
   made in decades toward a states-first constitutional amendment
   campaign."^[51]

   Tom Coburn has announced that after his retirement from Congress, he
   will focus on promoting the Convention of States to state
   legislatures.^[53]

   On April 2, 2014, the Alabama state house adopted a resolution calling
   for a constitutional convention to propose an amendment to ban same-sex
   marriage nation-wide.^[54]

       third to last paragraph, Hamilton states:

     But there is yet a further consideration, which proves beyond the
     possibility of a doubt, that the observation is futile. It is this
     that the national rulers, whenever nine States concur, will have no
     option upon the subject. By the fifth article of the plan, the
     Congress will be obliged "on the application of the legislatures of
     two thirds of the States [which at present amount to nine], to call
     a convention for proposing amendments, which shall be valid, to all
     intents and purposes, as part of the Constitution, when ratified by
     the legislatures of three fourths of the States, or by conventions
     in three fourths thereof." The words of this article are peremptory.
     The Congress "shall call a convention." Nothing in this particular
     is left to the discretion of that body. And of consequence, all the
     declamation about the disinclination to a change vanishes in air.
     Nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds or
     three fourths of the State legislatures, in amendments which may
     affect local interests, can there be any room to apprehend any such
     difficulty in a union on points which are merely relative to the
     general liberty or security of the people. We may safely rely on the
     disposition of the State legislatures to erect barriers against the
     encroachments of the national authority. If the foregoing argument
     is a fallacy, certain it is that I am myself deceived by it, for it
     is, in my conception, one of those rare instances in which a
     political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematical
     demonstration.
