       (Northwest Angle) – northernmost point in the 48 contiguous states
       (because of incomplete information at the time of the Treaty of
       Paris (1783) settling the American Revolutionary War)
     * Sumas, Washington 49°00′08.6″N 122°15′40″W﻿ / ﻿49.002389°N

       incorporated place in the 48 contiguous states (because of 19th
       century survey inaccuracy placing the international border slightly
       north of the 49th parallel here.^[1])
     * Bellingham, Washington 48°45′19.12″N 122°28′43.54″W﻿ /
       ﻿48.7553111°N 122.4787611°W﻿ / 48.7553111; -122.4787611﻿
       (Bellingham City Hall)  – northernmost city of more than 50,000

       States
     * Alaska has the northernmost geographic center of all the states.
       North Dakota has the northernmost geographic center of the 48
       contiguous states.

          Note that maps of the 48 states that are displayed in a
          non-cylindrical projection (i.e. curved lines of latitude) can
          give the impression that the state of Maine extends farther
          north than it actually does. The northernmost point in Maine is
          at approximately 47.46 degrees North latitude. This line of
          latitude passes through the southern suburbs of Seattle. From
          there, it is approximately 100 miles (160 km) north to the 49th
          parallel. A wide swath of land within the 48 states
          (encompassing portions of Washington, Idaho, Montana, North
          Dakota, and Minnesota) is therefore farther north than any place
          in Maine. Included in this area are such places as Spokane,
          Washington; Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Great Falls, Montana; Minot
          and Grand Forks, North Dakota; and Bemidji, Minnesota. Even Isle
          Royale and parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (such as the
          Keweenaw Peninsula) are farther north than anywhere in Maine. By
          comparison, the southernmost land in Canada, Middle Island,
          Ontario,at a latitude of North 41°40'53", lies entirely south of
          12 of the contiguous states - Washington, Idaho, Minnesota,
          Montana, North Dakota, Michigan, Maine, Wisconsin, Oregon, South
          Dakota, New Hampshire and Vermont - and south of the
          northernmost border of 14 more of the contiguous states.

       U.S. mainland
     * Miami, Florida – the southernmost major metropolitan city in the 48
       contiguous states
     * Hawaii has the southernmost geographic center of all the states.
       Florida has the southernmost geographic center of the 48 contiguous
       states.

          Note that maps of the 48 states that are displayed in an
          equal-area projection can give the impression that the state of
          Texas extends farther south than it actually does. The
          southernmost point in Texas (just southeast of Brownsville) is
          at approximately 25.84 degrees North latitude. This line of
          latitude passes through Hialeah, Florida, which is slightly
          north of Miami.

          Note that maps of the 48 states that are displayed in an
          equal-area projection can give the impression that the state of
          California extends farther west than it actually does. The
          westernmost point in California (Cape Mendocino) is
          approximately seven miles east of the westernmost point in
          Oregon (Cape Blanco), and approximately 14 miles (23 km) east of
          the westernmost point in Washington (Cape Alava).

Interpretation of easternmost and westernmost[edit]

   There are three methods for reckoning the eastern and western extremes
   of the United States.

   One method is to use the Prime Meridian as the dividing line between
   east and west. This meridian running through Greenwich, London, is
   defined as zero degrees longitude and could be called the least eastern
   and least western place in the world. The 180th meridian, on the
   opposite side of the globe, is therefore the easternmost and
   westernmost place in the world.

   Another method is to use the International Date Line as the
   easternmost–westernmost extreme. On the equinox, the easternmost place
   would be where the day first begins, and the westernmost is where the
   day last ends.

   Still another method is to first determine the geographic center of the
   country and from there measure the shortest distance to every other
   point. All U.S. territory is spread across less than 180° of longitude,
   so from any spot in the U.S. it is more direct to reach Point Udall,
   U.S. Virgin Islands, by traveling east than by traveling west.
   Likewise, there is not a single point in U.S. territory from which
   heading east is a shorter route to Point Udall, Guam, than heading west
   would be, even accounting for circumpolar routes. The two Udalls for
   whom the two Points are named were brothers, Mo Udall in Guam and
   Stewart Udall in the Virgin Islands.^[4]
