   It has been suggested that this article be merged into History of
   banking in the United States. (Discuss) Proposed since March 2013.

   Banking in the United States is regulated by both the federal and state
   governments. The five largest banks in the United States at December
   31, 2011 were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo,
   and Goldman Sachs.^[1] In December 2011, the five largest banks' assets
   were equal to 56 percent of the U.S. economy, compared with 43 percent
   five years earlier.

   The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business
   profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period,
   finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%,
   and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from
   10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to
   all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income
   earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New
   York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in
   2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to
   $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than
   $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by
   2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in
   deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more. American banking is
   closely linked to the UK; in 2014, the biggest US banks held almost 70
   percent of their on and off-balance sheet assets there.^[2]

Regulatory agencies[edit]

   Main article: Bank regulation in the United States

   Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared with
   other G10 countries. While most of these countries have only one bank
   regulator, in the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and
   state level. Depending on its type of charter and organizational
   structure, a banking organization may be subject to numerous federal
   and state banking regulations. Unlike Japan and the United Kingdom
   (where regulatory authority over the banking, securities and insurance
   industries is combined into one single financial-service agency), the
   U.S. maintains separate securities, commodities, and insurance
   regulatory agencies—separate from the bank regulatory agencies—at the
   federal and state level.^[3]

   U.S. banking regulation addresses privacy, disclosure, fraud
   prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending,
   and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations. Some
   individual cities also enact their own financial regulation laws (for
   example, defining what constitutes usurious lending).

   Since the enactment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
   Improvement Act of 1989 (FDICIA), all commercial banks that accept
   deposits are required to obtain FDIC insurance and to have a primary
   federal regulator (the Fed for state banks that are members of the
   Federal Reserve System, the FDIC for "nonmember" state banks, and the
   Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for all National Banks and
   Federal Savings Banks (FSB)).

   Federal credit unions are regulated by National Credit Union
   Administration (NCUA).

Federal Reserve system[edit]

   Main article: Federal Reserve system

   The central banking system of the United States, called the Federal
   Reserve system, was created in 1913 by the enactment of the Federal
   Reserve Act, largely in response to a series of financial panics,
   particularly a severe panic in 1907.^[4]^[5] Over time, the roles and
   responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its
   structure has evolved.^[6] Events such as the Great Depression were
   major factors leading to changes in the system.^[7] Its duties today,
   according to official Federal Reserve documentation, are to conduct the
   nation's monetary policy, supervise and regulate banking institutions,
   maintain the stability of the financial system and provide financial
   services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign
   official institutions.^[8]

   The Federal Reserve System's structure is composed of the
   presidentially appointed Board of Governors (or Federal Reserve Board),
   the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), twelve regional Federal
   Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation, numerous
   privately owned U.S. member banks and various advisory
   councils.^[5](See structure)^[9]^[10] The FOMC is the committee
   responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven
   members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank
   presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time.
   The responsibilities of the central bank are divided into several
   separate and independent parts, some private and some public. The
   result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks. It
   is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank, namely
   the United States Department of the Treasury, creates the currency
   used.^[11]

   According to the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve is independent
   within government in that "its decisions do not have to be ratified by
   the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of
   government." However, its authority is derived from the U.S. Congress
   and is subject to congressional oversight. Additionally, the members of
   the Board of Governors, including its chairman and vice-chairman, are
   chosen by the President and confirmed by Congress. The government also
   exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and
   setting the salaries of the system's highest-level employees. Thus the
   Federal Reserve has both private and public
   aspects.^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15] The U.S. Government receives all of the
   system's annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on member
   banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is
   maintained. In 2010, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $82 billion
   and transferred $79 billion to the U.S. Treasury.^[16]

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation[edit]

   Main article: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
   The FDIC's satellite campus in Arlington, Virginia, is home to many
   administrative and support functions, though the most senior officials
   work at the main building in Washington

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States
   government corporation created by the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. It
   provides deposit insurance, which guarantees the safety of deposits in
   member banks, up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. As of November 18,
   2010^[update], the FDIC insures deposits at 6,800 institutions.^[17]
   The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions
   for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection
   functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks).

   Since the start of FDIC insurance on January 1, 1934, no depositor has
   lost any insured funds as a result of a bank failure.^[18]

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency[edit]

   Main article: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a U.S. federal agency
   established by the National Currency Act of 1863 and serves to charter,
   regulate, and supervise all national banks and the federal branches and
   agencies of foreign banks in the United States. Thomas J. Curry was
   sworn in as the 30th Comptroller of the Currency on April 9, 2012.^[19]

Office of Thrift Supervision[edit]

   Main article: Office of Thrift Supervision

   The Office of Thrift Supervision is a United States federal agency
   under the Department of the Treasury. It was created in 1989 as a
   renamed version of another federal agency (that was faulted for its
   role in the Savings and loan crisis). Like other U.S. federal bank
   regulators, it is paid by the banks it regulates. OTS Is Now Part of
   the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. On July 21, 2011, the
   Office of Thrift Supervision became part of the Office of the
   Comptroller of the Currency.

Active banks of the United States[edit]

   A list of many commercial banks in the United States can be found at
   the website of the FDIC. According to the FDIC, there were 6,799
   FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States as of February 11,
   2014.^[17] Every member of the Federal Reserve System is listed along
   with non-members who are also insured by the FDIC. The list does not
   include banks and investments that are not FDIC-insured; however, since
   the FDIC Improvement Act of 1989, all commercial banks accepting
   deposits must be FDIC-insured.

   The five largest banks by assets in 2011 were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of
   America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.^[1]

Bank mergers and closures[edit]

   Bank mergers happen for many reasons in normal business, for example,
   to create a single larger bank in which operations of both banks can be
   streamlined; to acquire another bank's brands; or due to regulators
   closing the institution due to unsafe and unsound business practices or
   inadequate capitalization and liquidity.

   Banks may not go bankrupt in the United States. Depositor accounts are
   insured up to $250,000 as of October 2008 per individual per bank by
   the FDIC. Banks that are in danger of failing are either taken over by
   the FDIC, administered temporarily, then sold or merged with other
   banks. The FDIC maintains a list of banks showing institutions seized
   by regulators and the assuming institutions.

History[edit]

   Main article: History of banking in the United States

Antebellum history[edit]

   In the first half of the 19th century, many of the smaller commercial
   banks within New England were easily chartered under applicable laws
   (primarily due to open franchise laws). The rise of commercial banking
   saw an increase in opportunities for wealthy individuals to become
   involved in entrepreneurial projects in which they would not otherwise
   involve themselves without a third party to guarantee a return on their
   investment. These early banks acted as intermediaries for entrepreneurs
   who did not have enough wealth to fund their own investment projects
   and for those who did have wealth but did not want to bear the risk of
   investing in ventures. Thus, this private banking sector witnessed an
   array of insider lending, due primarily to low bank leverage and an
   information quality correlation, but many of these banks actually
   spurred early investment and helped spur many later projects. Despite
   what some may consider discriminatory practices with insider lending,
   these banks actually were very sound and failures remained uncommon,
   further encouraging the financial evolution in the United States.

Early attempts to create a national bank[edit]

   In 1781, the Congress of the Confederation established the Bank of
   North America in Philadelphia, where it superseded the state-chartered
   Bank of Pennsylvania, founded in 1780, to help fund the American
   Revolutionary War. The Bank of North America was granted a monopoly on
   the issue of bills of credit as currency at the national level. Prior
   to ratification of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union,
   only the States possessed sovereign power to charter a bank authorized
   to issue their own bills of credit. Afterwards, Congress also had that
   power.

   Robert Morris, the first Superintendent of Finance appointed under the
   Articles of Confederation, proposed the Bank of North America as a
   commercial bank that would act as the sole fiscal and monetary agent
   for the government. He has accordingly been called "the father of the
   system of credit, and paper circulation, in the United States."^[20] He
   saw a national, for-profit, private monopoly following in the footsteps
   of the Bank of England as necessary, because previous attempts to
   finance the Revolutionary War, such as continental currency issued by
   the Continental Congress, had led to depreciation of such an extent
   that Alexander Hamilton considered them to be "public embarrassments."
   After the war, a number of state banks were chartered, including in
   1784: the Bank of New York and the Bank of Massachusetts.

   In 1791, Congress chartered the First Bank of the United States to
   succeed the Bank of North America under Article One of the United
   States Constitution, Section 8. However, Congress failed to renew the
   charter for the Bank of the United States, which expired in 1811.
   Similarly, Congress chartered the Second Bank of the United States in
   1816 and allowed it to expire in 1836.

Jacksonian Era[edit]

   Main article: Banking in the Jacksonian Era

   The Second Bank of the United States opened in January 1817, six years
   after the First Bank of the United States lost its charter. The
   predominant reason that the Second Bank of the United States was
   chartered was that in the War of 1812, the U.S. experienced severe
   inflation and had difficulty in financing military operations.
   Subsequently, the credit and borrowing status of the United States was
   at its lowest level since its founding.

   The charter of the Second Bank of the United States (BUS) had a term of
   20 years and required renewal in 1836. Its role as the depository of
   the federal government's revenues made it a political target of banks
   chartered by the individual states who objected/envied the BUS's
   relationship with the central government. Partisan politics came
   heavily into play in the debate over the renewal of the charter.
   President Andrew Jackson strongly opposed the renewing the charter, and
   during election of 1832, based his campaign on abolishing the bank.

   Apart from a general hostility to banking and the belief that specie
   (gold and/or silver) were the only true money, Jackson's reasons for
   opposing the renewal of the charter revolved around his belief that
   bestowing power and responsibility upon a single bank was the cause of
   inflation and other perceived evils.

   During September 1833, President Jackson issued an executive order that
   ended the deposit of government funds into the BUS. After September
   1833, these deposits were placed in the state-chartered banks.

1837–1863: "Free Banking" Era[edit]

   The Free Banking era was a period characterized by the unrestrained
   entry of banks into the economy. Banks were not subject to any special
   regulations beyond those applicable to any other enterprise. The era
   spanned from 1836, after the BUS federal charter expired, to 1865 when
   the federal government imposed a tax on state banknotes.^[21] The
   Independent Treasury System was established under President Martin Van
   Buren, who extended Andrew Jackson's banking policies. It was
   characterized by a monetary policy where each bank was allowed to issue
   its own currency and as a consequence control the overall supply and
   quantity of banknotes. There was an absence of governmental insurance
   that is in place nowadays to protect deposits in case of a bank
   failure.

History and the Beginning of Free Banking[edit]

   Because Free Banking was a predecessor and natural alternative to
   monetary interventions, the theory and practice have been a subject to
   a great attention over the past centuries. Prior to 1837, establishing
   a banking institution in the US was a difficult and often politicized
   process as every bank needed a charter from the legislature of the
   state in which it was being founded and the number of available
   franchises were limited.^[22] The need for a new banking institutions
   appeared in 1836 when the Congress closed the Second Bank of the United
   States, a public institution with 25 branches across the country that
   helped to keep an adequate supply of money by limiting the number of
   notes issued. When its charter lapsed, there was a need for new
   financial establishments that would lend, invest, accept deposits, and
   issue money. New York state passed the first free banking statute in
   1838, followed by Michigan. By 1860 some eighteen states had enacted a
   variant of the free banking law modeled by the New York law 1838.^[23]
   The rapid introduction of the laws is ascribed to the populist,
   anti-Mason, egalitarian Jacksonian politics combined with an
   inflationary policy that was mistakenly believed to be a solution to
   deflation induced by the Panic of 1837.^[24]

Provisions of the New York Banking law 1838[edit]

   The provisions were aimed at easy and safe operation of the banks that
   has allowed anyone to operate a bank as long as two basic requirements
   were met:
    1. Bond security provision that did not limit a number of banks
       regulated by this law, but all notes the bank issued had to be
       backed by state bonds deposited at the state auditor's office and
       meet certain capital requirements ^[25] Prior to opening a bank,
       subscriptions for a minimum amount of capital funds were required.
       Person subscribing for a stock commonly paid in some of the funds
       and promised to provide additional funds up to the amount
       subscribed.^[21]
    2. Any bond security provision was to be deposited with the state on a
       dollar-for-dollar basis as a condition for the issuance of
       banknotes. In effect this means that all the notes issued by a
       particular banks were backed and redeemable by a specific quantity
       of specie - gold or silver, and used as checks in transactions
       nowadays. Hence the banknote value was the value of the bank
       assets. In a case of a bank failure, the state representing auditor
       would close the bank, sell the bonds, and use the proceeds to
       reimburse bondholders. If the bond sale did not generate enough
       specie to redeem a bank's bond obligation at par (dollar-per-dollar
       value), the bond holders had an another layer of protection by
       having the first claim to the bank’s other assets. Hence, the Free
       Banking Era in the U.S. meant free entry into banking, not a
       completely free market (sometimes referred to as
       Lasseiz-faire).^[25] In some states, the bank stock holders were
       even a subject to so-called "double liability," which mandated that
       in case of a bank failure, the stock holders would not only be
       responsible for the loss in the amount of their ownership, but they
       would also owe an additional equal amount from their own wealth to
       cover for the bank's losses.^[26]

The experience of Free Banking[edit]

   The free banking reforms were seen as a part of a greater struggle for
   liberty and hence much was expected from them. Free banking replaced
   special interest legislation with a systematic “rule of law,” in a form
   of highly idiosyncratic, flexible, personalized charter conditions. It
   was expected that the elimination of the privilege associated with the
   Safety Fund System 1929 would decrease legislative corruption and log
   rolling, the number of banks would increase and they would be more
   rationally located, and the end effect of more available credit would
   encourage commercial and manufacturing businesses. A bulk of evidence
   suggests that the free banking laws indeed helped the growth of the
   number of banks. In 1800, there were only 25 banks in the United States
   and this number grew to 1,364 in 1860.^[27] The bank expansion varied
   significantly across the states; for example New York and Pennsylvania
   had 4 and 2 banks in 1800, and this number grew to 299 and 80 in 1860
   respectively. Although the economic development in some areas might
   have had some influence on the discrepancies, the difference was most
   likely caused by different chartered policies in each state that
   controlled the reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and
   deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc.^[27] Many banks, however,
   failed to survive the period and provide a stable source of banking
   services, and a safe currency. In Minnesota, for example, between 1852
   and 1854, 57 banks or eighty percent of the state's financial
   institutions, ceased operation.^[28]

Wildcat banking and the failure of the Free Banking system[edit]

   Numerous banks that started during this period proved to be unstable,
   and many shut. It is widely believed that as a result of light
   governmental regulation, many dishonest bankers appeared and created a
   phenomenon called “wildcat banking,” which is believed to be the main
   cause of the downfall of Free Banking.^[29] Wildcat banking saw
   institutions defraud the public by issuing notes they could not redeem
   in specie (gold or silver). There are several theories about how the
   fraud occurred, the most well known being that the banks discouraged
   redemptions by establishing offices in areas populated only by wildcat
   banks, far from the communities where they had circulated the notes.
   After making a profit, the bankers would close the bank and disappear
   with its assets.^[28] However, among the banks that closed between 1838
   and 1863 only about 7% were identified as wildcats. In New York,
   Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota between 1838 and 1863, almost half
   the free banks closed, but less than 7 percent of the free banks could
   possibly have been wildcats. Yet in these states between 1852 and 1863,
   most of the closings (about 80 percent of those that involved
   noteholder losses) occurred during periods when bond prices strongly
   declined. And wildcat banking did not cause the declines.^[29] This
   leads to alternative explanations, such as that propounded by a
   well-known study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis: that banks
   suffered losses because of the substantial drops in the price of the
   state bonds that made up a large part of their portfolios.^[28]

National Bank Act[edit]

   Main article: National Bank Act

   To correct such conditions, Congress passed (1863) the National Bank
   Act, which provided for a system of banks to be chartered by the
   federal government. The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 were two
   United States federal laws that established a system of national
   charters for banks, and created the United States National Banking
   System. They encouraged development of a national currency backed by
   bank holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and established the Office of
   the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the Department of the
   Treasury and authorized the Comptroller to examine and regulate
   nationally-chartered banks.

   Congress passed the National Bank Act in an attempt to retire the
   greenbacks that it had issued to finance the North's effort in the
   American Civil War.^[30] This opened up an option for chartering banks
   nationally. As an additional incentive for banks to submit to Federal
   supervision, in 1865 Congress began taxing any of state bank notes
   (also called "bills of credit" or "scrip") a standard rate of 10%,
   which encouraged many state banks to become national ones. This tax
   also gave rise to another response by state banks—the widespread
   adoption of the demand deposit account, also known as a checking
   account. By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source
   of revenue for many banks. The result of these events is what is known
   as the "dual banking system." New banks may choose either state or
   national charters (a bank also can convert its charter from one to the
   other).

Rise of investment banks[edit]

   Main article: History of investment banking in the United States

Civil War[edit]

   During the Civil War, banking houses were syndicated to meet the
   federal government's need for money to fund its war efforts. Jay Cooke
   launched the first mass securities selling operation in U.S. history
   employing thousands of salesmen to float what ultimately amounted to
   $830 million worth of government bonds to a wide group of
   investors.^[31] Cooke then reached out to the general public, acting as
   an agent of the Treasury Department, and personally led a war bond
   drive that netted approximately $1.5 billion for Treasury.^[32]^[33]

Surging demand for capital in the Gilded Age[edit]

   The rise of the commercial banking sector coincided with the growth of
   early factories, since entrepreneurs had to rely on commercial banks in
   order to fund their own projects. Because of this need for capital,
   many banks began to arise by the late 19th century. By 1880, New
   England became one of the most heavily banked areas in the world.^[34]

   Lance Davis has demonstrated that the process of capital formation in
   the nineteenth century was markedly different between the British
   capital market and the American capital market. British industrialists
   were readily able to satisfy their need for capital by tapping a vast
   source of international capital through British banks such as
   Westminster's, Lloyds and Barclays. In contrast, the dramatic growth of
   the United States created capital requirements that far outstripped the
   limited capital resources of American banks. Investment banking in the
   United States emerged to serve the expansion of railroads, mining
   companies, and heavy industry. Unlike commercial banks, investment
   banks were not authorized to issue notes or accept deposits. Instead,
   they served as brokers or intermediaries, bringing together investors
   with capital and the firms that needed that capital.^[35]^[36]

Bimetallism and the gold standard[edit]

   Main article: Coinage Act of 1873
   See also: Bimetallism and Gold standard

   Toward the end of the nineteenth century, bimetallism became a center
   of political conflict During the civil war, to finance the war the U.S.
   switched from bimetallism to a flat greenback currency. In 1873, the
   government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption to specie
   payments began without the free and unlimited coinage of silver. This
   put the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard.^[37]

Early 20th century[edit]

   During the period from 1890–1925, the investment banking industry was
   highly concentrated and dominated by an oligopoly that consisted of JP
   Morgan & Co.; Kuhn, Loeb & Co.; Brown Brothers; and Kidder, Peabody &
   Co. There was no legal requirement to separate the operations of
   commercial and investment banks; as a result deposits from the
   commercial banking side of the business constituted an in-house supply
   of capital that could be used to fund the underwriting business of the
   investment banking side.^[38]

The Panic of 1907 and the Pujo Committee[edit]

   Main article: Pujo Committee

   In 1913, the Pujo Committee unanimously determined that a small cabal
   of financiers had gained consolidated control of numerous industries
   through the abuse of the public trust in the United States. The chair
   of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, Representative Arsène
   Pujo, (D–La. 7th) convened a special committee to investigate a "money
   trust", the de facto monopoly of Morgan and New York's other most
   powerful bankers. The committee issued a scathing report on the banking
   trade that concluded that a community of influential financial leaders
   had gained control of major manufacturing, transportation, mining,
   telecommunications and financial markets of the United States. The
   report revealed that no less than eighteen different major financial
   corporations were under control of a cartel led by J.P Morgan, George
   F. Baker and James Stillman. These three men, through the resources of
   seven banks and trust companies (Banker's Trust Co., Guaranty Trust
   Co., Astor Trust Co., National Bank of Commerce, Liberty National Bank,
   Chase National Bank, Farmer's Loan and Trust Co.) controlled an
   estimated $2.1 billion. The report revealed that a handful of men held
   manipulative control of the New York Stock Exchange and attempted to
   evade interstate commerce laws.

   The findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification
   of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, passage of the Federal Reserve Act
   that same year, and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914.

The Federal Reserve System[edit]

   Main article: Federal Reserve System

   A private conglomerate prevented the Panic of 1907 by establishing
   themselves up as "lenders of last resort" to banks in
   trouble.^[citation needed] This effort succeeded in stopping the panic,
   and led to calls for a federal agency to do the same thing.^[citation
   needed] In response, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created the
   Federal Reserve System, a new central bank intended serve as a formal
   "lender of last resort" to banks in times of liquidity crisis—panics
   where depositors tried to withdraw their money faster than a bank could
   pay it.

   The legislation provided for a system that included twelve regional
   Federal Reserve Banks and a seven-member governing board. All national
   banks were required to join the system and other banks had the option
   to join, thus banks came under the authority of the quasi-governmental
   entity. Congress created Federal Reserve notes to provide the nation
   with an elastic supply of currency. The notes were to be issued to
   Federal Reserve Banks for subsequent transmittal to banking
   institutions in accordance with the needs of the public.

McFadden Act[edit]

   Main article: McFadden Act

   The McFadden Act of 1927 was based on recommendations made by the
   Comptroller of Currency Henry May Dawes. The Act sought to give
   national banks competitive equality with state-chartered banks by
   letting national banks branch to the extent permitted by state law. The
   McFadden Act specifically prohibited interstate branching by allowing
   each national bank to branch only within the state in which it is
   located. Although the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
   Efficiency Act of 1994^[39] repealed this provision of the McFadden
   Act, it specified that state law continues to control intrastate
   branching, or branching within a state's borders, for both state and
   national banks.

Credit unions[edit]

   Main article: Credit unions in the United States

   Credit unions originated in Europe in the mid-19th century. The first
   credit union in the United States was established in 1908 in New
   Hampshire. At the time, banks were unwilling to lend to many poor
   laborers, who then turned to corrupt moneylenders and loan sharks.^[40]
   Businessman and philanthropist Edward Filene spearheaded an effort to
   secure legislation for credit unions first in Massachusetts and later
   throughout the United States. With the help of the Credit Union
   National Extension Bureau and an army of volunteers, states began
   passing credit union legislation in the 1920s. Credit unions were
   formed based on a bond of association, often beginning with a small
   group of employees. Despite opposition from the banking industry,
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal Credit Union Act
   into law in 1934 as part of the New Deal, allowing the creation of
   federally chartered credit unions in the United States and creating the
   Credit Union National Association (CUNA). By 1937, 6400 credit unions
   with 1.5 million members were active in 45 states.^[41] Today, the
   United States has over 9500 credit unions regulated by the National
   Credit Union Administration(NCUA).^[42]

Savings and loan associations[edit]

   Main article: Savings and loan association

   The savings and loan association became a strong force in the early
   20th century through assisting customers with home ownership, through
   mortgage lending, and further assisting their members with basic saving
   and investing outlets, typically through passbook savings accounts and
   term certificates of deposit.

   Congress passed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932, during the
   Great Depression. It established the Federal Home Loan Bank and
   associated Federal Home Loan Bank Board to assist other banks in
   providing funding to offer long term, amortizedloans for home
   purchases. The aim was to encourage banks, not insurance companies, to
   become lenders and to provide realistic loans which borrowers could
   repay to gain full-ownership of their homes.

   Savings and loan associations sprang-up across the United States to
   take advantage of low-cost funding available through the Federal Home
   Loan Bank for the purposes of mortgage lending.

New Deal-era reforms[edit]

   Further information: New Deal

   During the 1930s, the U.S. and the rest of the world experienced the
   Great Depression. During the height of the Depression in the U.S., the
   official unemployment rate was 25% and the stock market had declined
   75% since 1929. Bank runs were common because deposits were not insured
   and banks kept only a fraction of deposits in reserve. Customers ran
   the risk of losing their deposits if their bank failed.^[43]

   By the beginning of 1933, the banking system in the United States had
   effectively ceased to function. The incoming Roosevelt administration
   and the incoming Congress took immediate steps to pass legislation to
   respond to the Great Depression. Roosevelt entered office with enormous
   political capital. Americans of all political persuasions demanded
   immediate action, and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of
   new programs in the "first hundred days" of his administration, in
   which he met with Congress for 100 days. During that period of
   lawmaking, Congress granted every request Roosevelt made, and passed
   some programs, such as the FDIC, that he opposed.

   A major component of Roosevelt's New Deal was reform of the nation's
   banking system. With strident language Roosevelt took credit for
   dethroning the bankers he alleged had caused the debacle.^[44]

Emergency Banking Act[edit]

   Roosevelt closed all banks in the country and kept them all closed
   until he could pass new legislation.^[45] On March 9, Roosevelt sent to
   Congress the Emergency Banking Act, drafted in large part by Herberg
   Hoover's top advisors. The act, passed and signed into law the same
   day, provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury
   Department supervision, with federal loans available if needed.
   Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened
   within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and
   gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking
   system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently
   closed and merged into larger banks. Their depositors eventually
   received on average 86 cents on the dollar of their deposits, despite
   the common myth that they received nothing back.

Creation of the FDIC and FSLIC[edit]

   In June 1933, over Roosevelt's objections, Congress created the FDIC,
   which insured deposits up to $2,500 beginning January 1, 1934. On June
   16, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of
   1933. This legislation:^[43]
     * Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation
     * Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
     * Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state
       nonmember banks
     * Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S.
       Treasury and the Federal Reserve
     * Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first
       time
     * Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
     * Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
     * Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state
       law.

   The National Housing Act of 1934 contained provisions to create the
   FSLIC in order to insure deposits in savings and loans, a year after
   the FDIC began to insure deposits in commercial banks. It was
   administered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB).^[46]

Abandonment of the gold standard[edit]

   To deal with deflation, the nation abandoned the gold standard. In
   March and April in a series of laws and executive orders, the
   government suspended the gold standard for the U.S. dollar.^[47] Anyone
   holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it
   at the existing fixed price of US dollars, after which the US would no
   longer pay gold on demand for the dollar, and gold would no longer be
   considered valid legal tender for debts in private and public
   contracts. The dollar was allowed to float freely on foreign exchange
   markets with no guaranteed price in gold, only to be fixed again at a
   significantly lower level a year later with the passage of the Gold
   Reserve Act in 1934. Markets immediately responded well to the
   suspension, in the hope that the decline in prices would finally
   end.^[48]

Glass-Steagall Act of 1933[edit]

   The Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 was passed in reaction to the collapse
   of a large portion of the American commercial banking system in early
   1933. One of its provisions introduced the separation of bank types
   according to their business (commercial and investment banking). To
   comply with the new regulation, most large banks split into separate
   entities. For example, JP Morgan split into three entities: JP Morgan
   continued to operate as a commercial bank, Morgan Stanley formed to
   operate as an investment bank, and Morgan Grenfell operated as a
   British merchant bank.^[49]

Banking Act of 1935[edit]

   The Banking Act of 1935 strengthened the powers of the Federal Reserve
   Board of Governors in the area of credit management, tightened existing
   restrictions on banks engaging in certain activities, and expanded the
   supervisory powers of the FDIC.

   Together, the increased regulations of the New Deal era ushered in a
   period of stability in retail banking. The term 3-6-3 Rule (paying 3
   percent interest on deposits, lending money out at 6 percent, and being
   able to "tee off at the golf course by 3 p.m.") has been used to
   describe the post-World War II period until the deregulation of the
   1980s.^[50]^[51]

Bretton Woods system[edit]

   Main article: Bretton Woods system

   The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules
   for commercial and financial relations among the world's major
   industrial states in the mid-20th century. The Bretton Woods system was
   the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to
   govern monetary relations among independent nation-states.

   Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate
   the international monetary system, the planners at Bretton Woods
   established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International
   Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which today is part of
   the World Bank Group. The chief features of the Bretton Woods system
   were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that
   maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to the U.S. dollar
   and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments.

Automated teller machines[edit]

   Main article: Automated teller machine

   On September 2, 1969, Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S.
   at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were
   designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a
   specially coded card.^[52] A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted "On
   Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again."^[53]

Nixon shock[edit]

   Main article: Nixon Shock

   In 1971, President Richard Nixon took a series of economic measures
   that collectively are known as the Nixon Shock. These measures included
   unilaterally cancelling the direct convertibility of the United States
   dollar to gold that essentially ended the existing Bretton Woods system
   of international financial exchange.

Deregulation of the 1980s and 1990s[edit]

   Legislation passed by the federal government during the 1980s, such as
   the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of
   1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982,
   reduced the distinctions between banks and other financial institutions
   in the United States. This legislation is frequently referred to as
   "deregulation," and it is often blamed for the failure of over 500
   savings and loan associations between 1980 and 1988, and the subsequent
   failure of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)
   whose obligations were assumed by the FDIC in 1989. However, some
   critics of this viewpoint^[who?], particularly libertarians, have
   pointed-out that the federal government's attempts at deregulation
   granted easy credit to federally insured financial institutions,
   encouraging them to overextend themselves and (thus) fail.^[citation
   needed]

Savings and loan crisis[edit]

   Main article: Savings and loan crisis

   The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s was the failure of
   747 of the 3,234 savings and loan associations in the United States.
   "As of December 31, 1995, RTC estimated that the total cost for
   resolving the 747 failed institutions was $87.9 billion." The remainder
   of the bailout was paid for by charges on savings and loan
   accounts—which contributed to the large budget deficits of the early
   1990s.^[54]

   The concomitant slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate
   market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990–1991 economic
   recession. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of new homes constructed
   per year dropped from 1.8 million to 1 million, which was at the time
   the lowest rate since World War II.^[55]

Expansion of FDIC insurance – 1989[edit]

   Until 1989, national banks (those with national charters) were required
   to participate in the FDIC, while state banks either were required to
   obtain FDIC insurance by state law or could join voluntarily (usually
   in an attempt to bolster their appearance of solvency). After enactment
   of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1989
   (FDICIA), all commercial banks that accepted deposits were required to
   obtain FDIC insurance and to have a primary federal regulator (the Fed
   for state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, the
   FDIC for "nonmember" state banks, and the Office of the Comptroller of
   the Currency for all National Banks).

   Note: Federal credit unions are regulated by National Credit Union
   Administration (NCUA). Savings & Loan Associations (S&L) and Federal
   savings banks (FSB) are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision
   (OTS)

Interstate banking[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (May 2011)

   The Reigle-Neale Interstate Banking and Branching Act of 1994.^[56]

Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act[edit]

   Provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibit a bank holding
   company from owning other financial companies were repealed on November
   12, 1999, by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act.^[57]^[58]

   The repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 effectively removed the
   separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks
   and depository banks. Some political commentators on the American
   political left have claimed that this repeal directly contributed to
   the severity of the Financial crisis of
   2007–2010,^[59]^[60]^[61]^[62]^[63] but government reports and academic
   analyses of the crisis largely reject this claim.^[64]

Late-2000s financial crisis[edit]

   Main article: late-2000s financial crisis

   The late-2000s financial crisis is considered by many economists to be
   the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.^[65] It was
   triggered by a liquidity shortfall in the United States banking
   system^[66] and has resulted in the collapse of large financial
   institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments, and
   downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing
   market has also suffered, resulting in numerous evictions, foreclosures
   and prolonged vacancies. It contributed to the failure of key
   businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in the trillions of
   U.S. dollars, and a significant decline in economic activity, leading
   to a severe global economic recession in 2008.^[67]

   The collapse of the U.S. housing bubble, which peaked in 2006, caused
   the values of securities tied to U.S. real estate pricing to plummet,
   damaging financial institutions globally.^[68] Questions regarding bank
   solvency, declines in credit availability and damaged investor
   confidence had an impact on global stock markets, where securities
   suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009. Economies worldwide
   slowed during this period, as credit tightened and international trade
   declined.^[69] Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors
   failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related
   financial products, and that governments did not adjust their
   regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.^[70]
   Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal
   stimulus, monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts.

   There is some debate as to what role the repeal of Glass–Steagall had
   on the late 2000s financial crisis.^[63]

   Although there have been aftershocks, the financial crisis itself ended
   sometime between late 2008 and mid-2009.^[71]^[72]^[73] While many
   causes for the financial crisis have been suggested, with varying
   weight assigned by experts, the Levin–Coburn Report by United States
   Senate found "that the crisis was not a natural disaster, but the
   result of high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts
   of interest; and the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies,
   and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall
   Street."^[74]^[75]

   Both market-based and regulatory solutions have been implemented or are
   under consideration.^[76]

   Many have expressed nostalgia for the stability of the 1950s through
   the 1980s, the era of the 3-6-3 Rule, as a preferable way for banks to
   operate following the bailout of major banks.^[77]^[78]

Expansion of FDIC insurance – 2008–2010[edit]

   Due to the 2008 financial crisis, and to encourage businesses and
   high-net-worth individuals to keep their cash in the largest banks
   (rather than spreading it out), Congress temporarily increased the
   insurance limit to $250,000. With the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall
   Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, this increase became
   permanent as of July 21, 2010.

Dodd–Frank Act[edit]

   Main article: Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
   [icon] This section requires expansion. (May 2011)

   The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is the
   most sweeping change to financial regulation in the United States since
   the Great Depression,^[79]^[80]^[81] and represents a significant
   change in the American financial regulatory environment affecting all
   Federal financial regulatory agencies and affecting almost every aspect
   of the nation's financial services industry.^[82]^[83] In the years
   following its implementation many Republicans wanted the law revoked,
   however President Obama in July 2014 remained in support of the
   regulation, while saying more reform was necessary, particularly in
   terms of the internal structuring of individual banks.^[84]
