Social programs in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The Social Security Administration, created in 1935, was the first
   major federal welfare agency and continues to be the most
   prominent.^[1]

   Social programs in the United States are welfare subsidies designed to
   aid the needs of the U.S. population. Proposals for federal programs
   began with Theodore Roosevelt's New Nationalism and expanded with
   Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, John F.
   Kennedy's New Frontier, and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society.

   The programs vary in eligibility requirements and are provided by
   various organizations on a federal, state, local and private level.
   They help to provide food, shelter, education, healthcare and money to
   U.S. citizens through primary and secondary education, subsidies of
   college education, unemployment disability insurance, subsidies for
   eligible low-wage workers, subsidies for housing, Supplemental
   Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, pensions for eligible persons
   and health insurance programs that cover public employees. The Social
   Security system is the largest and most prominent social aid
   program.^[1]^[2] Medicare is another prominent program.

   Not including Social Security and Medicare, Congress allocated almost
   $717 billion in Federal funds in 2010 plus $210 billion was allocated
   in state funds ($927 billion total) for means tested welfare programs
   in the United States—later (after 2010) expenditures are unknown but
   higher.^[3] As of 2011, the public social spending-to-GDP ratio in the
   United States was below the OECD average.^[4] Roughly half of this
   welfare assistance, or $462 billion went to families with children,
   most of which are headed by single parents. ^[5]

   Total Social Security and Medicare expenditures in 2013 were $1.3
   trillion, 8.4% of the $16.3 trillion GNP (2013) and 37% of the total
   Federal expenditure budget of $3.684 trillion.^[6]^[7]

   In addition to government expenditures private welfare spending in the
   United States is thought to be about 10% of the U.S. GDP or another
   $1.6 trillion.^[8]

   Social programs have been implemented to promote a variety of societal
   goals, including alleviating the effects of poverty on those earning or
   receiving low income or encountering serious medical problems, and
   ensuring retired people have a basic standard of living.

   Unlike in Europe, Christian democratic and social democratic theories
   have not played a major role in shaping welfare policy in the United
   States.^[10] Entitlement programs in the U.S. were virtually
   non-existent until the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
   the implementation of the New Deal programs in response to the Great
   Depression. Between 1932 and 1981, modern American liberalism dominated
   U.S. economic policy and the entitlements grew along with American
   middle class wealth.^[11]

   Eligibility for welfare benefits depends on a variety of factors,
   including gross and net income, family size, pregnancy, homelessness,
   unemployment, and serious medical conditions like blindness, kidney
   failure or AIDS.

Drug Testing for applicants[edit]

   The United States adopted the Personal Responsibility and Work
   Opportunity Act in 1996, which gave individual states the authority to
   drug test welfare recipients. Drug testing in order for potential
   recipients to receive welfare has become an increasingly controversial
   topic. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina claims he
   pushes for drug screening as a matter of "moral obligation" and that
   testing should be enforced as a way for the United States government to
   discourage drug usage.^[12] Others claim that ordering the needy to
   drug test "stereotypes, stigmatizes, and criminalizes" them without
   need.^[13] States that currently require drug tests to be performed in
   order to receive public assistance include Arizona, Florida, Georgia,
   Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Utah.^[14]

Demographics of TANF Recipients[edit]

   (AFDC then TANF) per recipient 1962–2006 (in 2006 dollars).^[15]

   Some have argued that welfare has come to be associated with poverty.
   Martin Gilens, assistant professor of Political Science at Yale
   University, argues that blacks have overwhelmingly dominated images of
   poverty over the last few decades and states that "white Americans with
   the most exaggerated misunderstandings of the racial composition of the
   poor are the most likely to oppose welfare".^[16]^[17] This perception
   possibly perpetuates negative racial stereotypes and could increase
   Americans’ opposition and racialization of welfare policies.^[16]

   In FY 2010, African-American families comprised 31.9% of TANF families,
   white families comprised 31.8%, and 30.0% were Hispanic.^[18] Since the
   implementation of TANF, the percentage of Hispanic families has
   increased, while the percentages of white and black families have
   decreased. In FY 1997, African-American families represented 37.3% of
   TANF recipient families, white families 34.5%, and Hispanic families
   22.5%.^[19] The population as a whole is composed of 63.7% whites,
   16.3% Hispanic, 12.5% African-American, 4.8% Asian and 2.9% other
   races.^[20] TANF programs at a cost of about $20.0 billion (2013) have
   decreased in use as Earned Income Tax Credits, Medicaid grants,
   Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, Supplemental
   Security Income (SSI), child nutrition programs (CHIP), housing
   assistance, Feeding Programs (WIC & CSFP), along with about 70 more
   programs, have increased to over $700 billion more in 2013.^[21]

Costs[edit]

   In 2002, total U.S. social welfare expenditure constitutes over 35% of
   GDP, with purely public expenditure constituting 21%, publicly
   supported but privately provided welfare services constituting 10% of
   GDP and purely private services constituting 4% of GDP. This compared
   to the "welfare" states of France and Sweden where welfare spending
   ranges from 30% to 35% of GDP.^[22]^[23]

   The Great Recession made a large impact on welfare spending. In a 2011
   article, Forbes reported, "The best estimate of the cost of the 185
   federal means tested welfare programs for 2010 for the federal
   government alone is $717 billion, up a third since 2008, according to
   the Heritage Foundation. Counting state spending of about $210 million,
   total welfare spending for 2010 reached over $920 billion, up nearly
   one-fourth since 2008 (24.3%)"—and increasing fast.^[24] The previous
   decade had seen a 60% decrease in the number of people receiving
   welfare benefits,^[25] beginning with the passage of the Personal
   Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, but spending did not decrease
   proportionally during that time period.

   According to the Congressional Budget Office, social programs
   significantly raise the standard of living for low-income Americans,
   particularly the elderly. The poorest 20% of American households earn a
   before-tax average of only $7,600 - less than half of the federal
   poverty line. Social programs increase those households' before-tax
   income to $30,500. Social Security and Medicare are responsible for
   two-thirds of that increase.^[26]

History[edit]

Federal Social Welfare programs[edit]

   Colonial legislatures and later State governments adopted legislation
   patterned after the English "poor" laws. Aid to veterans, often free
   grants of land, and pensions for widows and handicapped veterans, have
   been offered in all U.S. wars. Following World War I, provisions were
   made for a full-scale system of hospital and medical care benefits for
   veterans. By 1929, workers’ compensation laws were in effect in all but
   four States. These state laws made industry and businesses responsible
   for the costs of compensating workers or their survivors when the
   worker was injured or killed in connection with his or her job.
   Retirement programs for mainly State and local government paid
   teachers, police officers, and fire fighters—date back to the 19th
   century. All these social programs were far from universal and varied
   considerably from one state to another.

   Prior to the Great Depression the United States had social programs
   that mostly centered around individual efforts, family efforts, church
   charities, business workers compensation, life insurance and sick leave
   programs along with some state tax supported social programs. The
   misery and poverty of the great depression threatened to overwhelm all
   these programs. The severe Depression of the 1930s made Federal action
   almost a necessity, as neither the States and the local communities,
   businesses and industries, nor private charities had the financial
   resources to cope with the growing need among the American people.
   Beginning in 1932, the Federal Government first made loans, then
   grants, to States to pay for direct relief and work relief. After that,
   special Federal emergency relief like the Civilian Conservation Corps
   and other public works programs were started. In 1935, President
   Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration proposed to Congress federal
   social relief programs and a federally sponsored retirement program.
   Congress followed by the passage of the 37 page Social Security Act,
   signed into law August 14, 1935 and "effective" by 1939—just as World
   War II began. This program was expanded several times over the years.

War on Poverty and Great Society programs (1960s)[edit]

   Further information: War on Poverty and Great Society

   Virtually all food stamp costs are paid by the federal government.^[27]
   In 2008, 28.7 percent of the households headed by single women were
   considered poor.^[28]

Welfare reform (1990s)[edit]

   Before the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, welfare assistance was "once
   considered an open-ended right," but welfare reform converted it "into
   a finite program built to provide short-term cash assistance and steer
   people quickly into jobs."^[29] Prior to reform, states were given
   "limitless"^[29] money by the federal government, increasing per family
   on welfare, under the 60-year-old Aid to Families with Dependent
   Children (AFDC) program.^[30] This gave states no incentive to direct
   welfare funds to the neediest recipients or to encourage individuals to
   go off welfare benefits (the state lost federal money when someone left
   the system).^[31] Nationwide, one child in seven received AFDC
   funds,^[30] which mostly went to single mothers.^[27]

   In 1996, under the Bill Clinton administration, Congress passed the
   Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which
   gave more control of the welfare system to the states though there are
   basic requirements the states need to meet with regards to welfare
   services. Still, most states offer basic assistance, such as health
   care, food assistance, child care assistance, unemployment, cash aid,
   and housing assistance. After reforms, which President Clinton said
   would "end welfare as we know it,"^[27] amounts from the federal
   government were given out in a flat rate per state based on
   population.^[31]

   Each state must meet certain criteria to ensure recipients are being
   encouraged to work themselves out of welfare. The new program is called
   Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).^[30] It encourages
   states to require some sort of employment search in exchange for
   providing funds to individuals, and imposes a five-year lifetime limit
   on cash assistance.^[25]^[27]^[30] The bill restricts welfare from most
   legal immigrants and increased financial assistance for child
   care.^[25] The federal government also maintains an emergency $2
   billion TANF fund to assist states that may have rising
   unemployment.^[30]
   President Bill Clinton signing welfare reform legislation.

   Following these changes, millions of people left the welfare rolls (a
   60% drop overall),^[25] employment rose, and the child poverty rate was
   reduced.^[27] A 2007 Congressional Budget Office study found that
   incomes in affected families rose by 35%.^[25] The reforms were "widely
   applauded"^[32] after "bitter protest."^[27] The Times called the
   reform "one of the few undisputed triumphs of American government in
   the past 20 years."^[33]

   Critics of the reforms sometimes point out that the massive decrease of
   people on the welfare rolls during the 1990s wasn't due to a rise in
   actual gainful employment in this population, but rather, was due
   almost exclusively to their offloading into workfare, giving them a
   different classification than classic welfare recipient. The late 1990s
   were also considered an unusually strong economic time, and critics
   voiced their concern about what would happen in an economic
   downturn.^[27]

   National Review editorialized that the Economic Stimulus Act of 2009
   will reverse the welfare-to-work provisions that Bill Clinton signed in
   the 1990s, and will again base federal grants to states on the number
   of people signed up for welfare rather than at a flat rate.^[31] One of
   the experts who worked on the 1996 bill said that the provisions would
   lead to the largest one-year increase in welfare spending in American
   history.^[33] The House bill provides $4 billion to pay 80% of states'
   welfare caseloads.^[30] Although each state received $16.5 billion
   annually from the federal government as welfare rolls dropped, they
   spent the rest of the block grant on other types of assistance rather
   than saving it for worse economic times.^[29]

Timeline[edit]

   The following is a short timeline of welfare in the United States:^[35]

   1880s–1890s: Attempts were made to move poor people from work yards to
   poor houses if they were in search of relief funds.

   1893–1894: Attempts were made at the first unemployment payments, but
   were unsuccessful due to the 1893–1894 recession.

   1932: The Great Depression had gotten worse and the first attempts to
   fund relief failed. The "Emergency Relief Act", which gave local
   governments $300 million, was passed into law.

Social security[edit]

   Main article: Social Security (United States)

   The Social Security program mainly refers to the Old Age, Survivors,
   and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program, and possibly the unemployment
   insurance program. Retirement Insurance Benefits (RIB), also known as
   Old-age Insurance Benefits, are a form of social insurance payments
   made by the U.S. Social Security Administration paid based upon the
   attainment old age (62 or older).

   Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD or SSDI) is a federal
   insurance program that provides income supplements to people who are
   restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable
   disability.

   Unemployment insurance, also known as unemployment compensation,
   provides for money, from the United States and the state collected from
   employers, to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of
   their own. The unemployment benefits are run by each state with
   different state defined criteria for duration, percent of income paid,
   etc.. Nearly all require the recipient to document their search for
   employment to continue receiving benefits. Extensions of time for
   receiving benefits are sometimes offered for extensive work
   unemployment. These extra benefits are usually in the form of loans
   from the federal government that have to be repaid by each state.

General welfare[edit]

   Main articles: Supplemental Security Income and Temporary Assistance
   for Needy Families

   The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides stipends to
   low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or
   disabled.

   The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) provides cash
   assistance to indigent American families with dependent children.

Healthcare spending[edit]

   Main articles: Health care in the United States, Medicare (United
   States) and Medicaid

   Health care in the United States is provided by many separate legal
   entities. Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by the
   private sector. Health insurance in the United States is now primarily
   provided by the government in the public sector, with 60–65% of
   healthcare provision and spending coming from programs such as
   Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the Children's Health Insurance Program,
   and the Veterans Health Administration.

   Medicare is a social insurance program administered by the United
   States government, providing health insurance coverage to people who
   are aged 65 and over; to those who are under 65 and are permanently
   physically disabled or who have a congenital physical disability; or to
   those who meet other special criteria like the End Stage Renal Disease
   program (ESRD). Medicare in the United States somewhat resembles a
   single-payer health care system but is not. Before Medicare, only 51%
   of people aged 65 and older had health care coverage, and nearly 30%
   lived below the federal poverty level.

   Medicaid is a health program for certain people and families with low
   incomes and resources. It is a means-tested program that is jointly
   funded by the state and federal governments, and is managed by the
   states.^[37] People served by Medicaid are U.S. citizens or legal
   permanent residents, including low-income adults, their children, and
   people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily
   qualify someone for Medicaid. Medicaid is the largest source of funding
   for medical and health-related services for people with limited income
   in the United States.

   The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a program
   administered by the United States Department of Health and Human
   Services that provides matching funds to states for health insurance to
   families with children.^[38] The program was designed to cover
   uninsured children in families with incomes that are modest but too
   high to qualify for Medicaid.

   The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Block Grant (or
   ADMS Block Grant) is a federal assistance block grant given by the
   United States Department of Health and Human Services.

Education spending[edit]

   Main article: Education in the United States
   University of California, Berkeley is one of the oldest public
   universities in the U.S.

   Per capita spending on tertiary education is among the highest in the
   world^[citation needed]. Public education is managed by individual
   states, municipalities and regional school districts. As in all
   developed countries, primary and secondary education is free, universal
   and mandatory. Parents do have the option of home-schooling their
   children, though some states, such as California (until a 2008 legal
   ruling overturned this requirement^[39]), require parents to obtain
   teaching credentials before doing so. Experimental programs give
   lower-income parents the option of using government issued vouchers to
   send their kids to private rather than public schools in some
   states/regions.

   As of 2007, more than 80% of all primary and secondary students were
   enrolled in public schools, including 75% of those from households with
   incomes in the top 5%. Public schools commonly offer after-school
   programs and the government subsidizes private after school programs,
   such as the Boys & Girls Club. While pre-school education is subsidized
   as well, through programs such as Head Start, many Americans still find
   themselves unable to take advantage of them. Some education critics
   have therefore proposed creating a comprehensive transfer system to
   make pre-school education universal, pointing out that the financial
   returns alone would compensate for the cost.

   Tertiary education is not free, but is subsidized by individual states
   and the federal government. Some of the costs at public institutions is
   carried by the state.

   The government also provides grants, scholarships and subsidized loans
   to most students. Those who do not qualify for any type of aid, can
   obtain a government guaranteed loan and tuition can often be deducted
   from the federal income tax. Despite subsidized attendance cost at
   public institutions and tax deductions, however, tuition costs have
   risen at three times the rate of median household income since
   1982.^[40] In fear that many future Americans might be excluded from
   tertiary education, progressive Democrats have proposed increasing
   financial aid and subsidizing an increased share of attendance costs.
   Some Democratic politicians and political groups have also proposed to
   make public tertiary education free of charge, i.e. subsidizing 100% of
   attendance cost.^[citation needed]

Food assistance[edit]

   Main articles: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Special
   Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children

   In the U.S., financial assistance for food purchasing for low- and
   no-income people is provided through the Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp
   Program.^[41] This federal aid program is administered by the Food and
   Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but benefits
   are distributed by the individual U.S. states. It is historically and
   commonly known as the Food Stamp Program, though all legal references
   to "stamp" and "coupon" have been replaced by "EBT" and "card,"
   referring to the refillable, plastic Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT)
   cards that replaced the paper "food stamp" coupons. To be eligible for
   SNAP benefits, the recipients must have incomes below 130 percent of
   the poverty line, and also own few assets.^[42] Since the economic
   downturn began in 2008, the use of food stamps has increased.^[42]

   The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and
   Children (WIC) is a child nutrition program for healthcare and
   nutrition of low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and
   infants and children under the age of five. The eligibility requirement
   is a family income below 185% of the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines,
   but if a person participates in other benefit programs, or has family
   members who participate in SNAP, Medicaid, or Temporary Assistance for
   Needy Families, they automatically meet the eligibility requirements.

   The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a type of United
   States Federal assistance provided by the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture (USDA) to states in order to provide a daily subsidized
   food service for an estimated 3.2 million children and 112,000 elderly
   or mentally or physically impaired adults^[43] in non-residential,
   day-care settings.^[44]

Public housing[edit]

   Main articles: Public housing in the United States and Section 8
   (housing)

   The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 created Section 8
   housing, the payment of rent assistance to private landlords on behalf
   of low-income households.
