   The United States home front during World War II supported the war
   effort in many ways, including a wide range of volunteer efforts and
   submitting to government-managed rationing and price controls. Everyone
   agreed that the sacrifices were for the national good "for the
   duration." The labor market changed radically. Peacetime conflicts with
   respect to race and labor took on a special dimension because of the
   pressure for national unity. The Hollywood film industry was important
   for propaganda. Every aspect of life from politics to personal savings
   changed when put on a wartime footing. This was achieved by tens of
   millions of workers moving from low to high productivity jobs in
   industrial centers. Millions of students, retirees, housewives, and
   unemployed moved into the active labor force. Hours worked increased as
   leisure activities declined sharply. Most families were allocated only
   3 US gallons (11 l; 2.5 imp gal) of gasoline a week, which sharply
   curtailed driving for any purpose. Production of most durable goods,
   like cars, new housing, vacuum cleaners, and kitchen appliances, was
   banned until the war ended.^[1] Meat, clothing, and gasoline were
   tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as
   people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were
   controlled. Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led
   to renewed growth after the war.^[2]^[3]

Controls and Taxes[edit]

   Federal tax policy was highly contentious during the war, with
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress.
   However, both sides agreed on the need for high taxes (along with heavy
   borrowing) to pay for the war: top marginal tax rates ranged from
   81%-94% for the duration of the war, and the income level subject to
   the highest rate was lowered from $5,000,000 to $200,000. Roosevelt
   tried unsuccessfully, by executive order 9250,^[4] to impose a 100%
   surtax on after-tax incomes over $25,000 (equal to roughly $340,721
   today). However Roosevelt did manage to impose this cap on executive
   pay in corporations with government contracts.^[5] Congress also
   enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes, and
   by reducing personal exemptions and deductions. By 1944 nearly every
   employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in
   1940).^[6]

   Many controls were put on the economy. The most important were price
   controls, imposed on most products and monitored by the Office of Price
   Administration. Wages were also controlled.^[7] Corporations dealt with
   numerous agencies, especially the War Production Board (WPB), and the
   War and Navy departments, which had the purchasing power and priorities
   that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production.^[8]

Rationing[edit]

   Main article: Rationing § United States
   Sugar rationing

   In 1942 a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of
   necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation.
   Tires were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 because
   supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved
   an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the Combined
   Food Board was set up to coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the
   Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to
   Britain. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to
   purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned
   foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk
   or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items—like
   automobiles and home appliances were no longer made. The rationing
   system did not apply to used goods (like clothes or cars), but they
   became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.

   To get a classification and a book of rationing stamps, one had to
   appear before a local rationing board. Each person in a household
   received a ration book, including babies and children. When purchasing
   gasoline, a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book
   and cash. Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall
   hoarding. All forms of automobile racing were banned, including the
   Indianapolis 500 which was cancelled from 1942 to 1945, for the
   duration of the war. Sightseeing driving was banned.

Personal savings[edit]

   Personal income was at an all-time high, and more dollars were chasing
   fewer goods to purchase. This was a recipe for economic disaster that
   was largely avoided because Americans—cajoled daily by their government
   to do so—were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War
   Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies.
   Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in war bonds
   that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll
   deduction; children collected savings stamps until they had enough to
   buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with famous
   celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond
   advertising effectiveness. Several stars were responsible for personal
   appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond
   pledges—an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid ¾ of the face
   value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set
   number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to
   postwar, and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with
   moderate inflation.^[9] Americans were challenged to put “at least 10%
   of every paycheck into Bonds“. Compliance was very high, with entire
   factories of workers earning a special “Minuteman” flag to fly over
   their plant if all workers belonged to the “Ten Percent Club”. There
   were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their
   goals.^[10]

Labor[edit]

   The unemployment problem ended with the mobilization for war. Out of a
   labor force of 54 million, unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million
   in spring 1940 (when the first accurate statistics were compiled) to
   3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5 million in fall
   1942, hitting an all-time low of 700,000 in fall 1944.^[11] There was a
   growing labor shortage in war centers, with sound trucks going street
   by street begging for people to apply for war jobs.

   Greater wartime production created millions of new jobs, while the
   draft reduced the number of young men available for civilian jobs. So
   great was the demand for labor that millions of retired people,
   housewives, and students entered the labor force, lured by patriotism
   and wages.^[12] The shortage of grocery clerks caused retailers to
   convert from service at the counter to self-service. With new shorter
   women clerks replacing taller men, some stores lowered shelves to
   5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m). Before the war most groceries, dry cleaners,
   drugstores, and department stores offered home delivery service. The
   labor shortage and gasoline and tire rationing caused most retailers to
   stop delivery. They found that requiring customers to buy their
   products in person increased sales.^[13]

Women[edit]

   Tennessee, 1943.

   Women also joined the workforce to replace men who had joined the
   forces, though in fewer numbers. Roosevelt stated that the efforts of
   civilians at home to support the war through personal sacrifice was as
   critical to winning the war as the efforts of the soldiers themselves.
   “Rosie the Riveter” became the symbol of women laboring in
   manufacturing. The war effort brought about significant changes in the
   role of women in society as a whole. When the male breadwinner
   returned, wives could stop working. At the end of the war, most of the
   munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others
   retooled for civilian production. In some jobs women were replaced by
   returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in
   service. However the number of women at work in 1946 was 87% of the
   number in 1944, leaving 13% who lost or quit their jobs.

   during the war years.^[14]

   1946 60,520 43,690 16,840 27.8

Farming[edit]

   Labor shortages were felt in agriculture, even though most farmers were
   given an exemption and few were drafted. Large numbers volunteered or
   moved to cities for factory jobs. At the same time many agricultural
   commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian
   populations of Allies. Production was encouraged and prices and markets
   were under tight federal control.^[15] Civilians were encouraged to
   create "victory gardens", farms that were often started in backyards
   and lots. Children were encouraged to help with these farms, too.^[16]

   The Bracero Program, a bi-national labor agreement between Mexico and
   the U.S., started in 1942. Some 290,000 braceros (“strong arms,” in
   Spanish) were recruited and contracted to work in the agriculture
   fields. Half went to Texas, and 20% to the Pacific Northwest.^[17]^[18]

   Between 1942 and 1946 some 425,000 Italian and German prisoners of war
   were used as farm laborers, loggers, and cannery workers. In Michigan,
   for example, the POWs accounted for more than one-third of the state’s
   agricultural production and food processing in 1944.^[19]

Children[edit]

   To help with the need for a larger source of food, the nation looked to
   school-aged children to help on farms. Schools often had a victory
   garden in vacant parking lots and on roofs. Children would help on
   these farms to help with the war effort.^[20] The slogan, "Grow your
   own, can your own", also influenced children to help at home.^[21]

Teenagers[edit]

   With the war’s ever increasing need for able bodied men consuming
   America’s labor force in the early 1940s, industry turned to teen-aged
   boys and girls to fill in as replacements.^[22] Consequently, many
   states had to change their child-labor laws to allow these teenagers to
   work. The lures of patriotism, adulthood, and money led many youth to
   drop out of school and take a defense job. Between 1940 and 1944, the
   number of teenage workers increased by 1.9 million, and the number of
   students in public high schools dropped from 6.6 million in 1940 to 5.6
   million in 1944, as a million students—and many teachers—took
   jobs.^[23]

Labor unions[edit]

   Chattanooga, Tennessee. June 1942.

   The war mobilization changed the relationship of the Congress of
   Industrial Organizations (CIO) with both employers and the national
   government.^[24] Both the CIO and the larger American Federation of
   Labor (AFL) grew rapidly in the war years.^[25]

   Nearly all the unions that belonged to the CIO were fully supportive of
   both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration. However the
   United Mine Workers, who had taken an isolationist stand in the years
   leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt's reelection in 1940,
   left the CIO in 1942. The major unions supported a wartime no-strike
   pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new
   contracts, but also the innumerable small strikes called by shop
   stewards and local union leadership to protest particular grievances.
   In return for labor's no-strike pledge, the government offered
   arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts.
   Those procedures produced modest wage increases during the first few
   years of the war but not enough to keep up with inflation, particularly
   when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery.^[26]

   Even though the complaints from union members about the no-strike
   pledge became louder and more bitter, the CIO did not abandon it. The
   Mine Workers, by contrast, who did not belong to either the AFL or the
   CIO for much of the war, threatened numerous strikes including a
   successful twelve-day strike in 1943. The strikes and threats made mine
   leader John L. Lewis a much hated man and led to legislation hostile to
   unions.^[27]

   All the major unions grew stronger during the war. The government put
   pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of
   turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions
   were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form
   of union security, through arbitration and negotiation. Employers gave
   workers new untaxed benefits (such as vacation time, pensions, and
   health insurance), which increased real incomes even when wage rates
   were frozen.^[28] The wage differential between higher skilled and less
   skilled workers narrowed, and with the enormous increase in overtime
   for blue collar wage workers (at time and a half pay), incomes in
   working class households shot up, while the salaried middle class lost
   ground.

   The experience of bargaining on a national basis, while restraining
   local unions from striking, also tended to accelerate the trend toward
   bureaucracy within the larger CIO unions. Some, such as the
   Steelworkers, had always been centralized organizations in which
   authority for major decisions resided at the top. The UAW, by contrast,
   had always been a more grassroots organization, but it also started to
   try to rein in its maverick local leadership during these years.^[29]
   The CIO also had to confront deep racial divides in its own membership,
   particularly in the UAW plants in Detroit where white workers sometimes
   struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs,
   but also in shipyards in Alabama, mass transit in Philadelphia, and
   steel plants in Baltimore. The CIO leadership, particularly those in
   further left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers, the UAW, the NMU,
   and the Transport Workers, undertook serious efforts to suppress hate
   strikes, to educate their membership, and to support the Roosevelt
   Administration's tentative efforts to remedy racial discrimination in
   war industries through the Fair Employment Practices Commission. Those
   unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the
   timidity and racism of the AFL.^[30]

   The CIO unions were progressive in dealing with gender discrimination
   in wartime industry, which now employed many more women workers in
   nontraditional jobs. Unions that had represented large numbers of women
   workers before the war, such as the UE (electrical workers) and the
   Food and Tobacco Workers, had fairly good records of fighting
   discrimination against women. Most union leaders saw women as temporary
   wartime replacements for the men in the armed forces. It was important
   that the wages of these women be kept high so that the veterans would
   get high wages.^[31]

Civilian support for war effort[edit]

   See also: United States civil defense § World War II and American
   propaganda during World War II
   A synagogue in New York City remained open 24 hours on D-Day (June 6,
   1944) for special services and prayer.

   Early in the war, it became apparent that German U-boats were using the
   backlighting of coastal cities in the Eastern Seaboard and the South to
   destroy ships exiting harbors. It became the first duties of civilians
   recruited for local civilian defense to ensure that lights were either
   off or thick curtains drawn over all windows at night.

   State Guards were reformed for internal security duties to replace the
   National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil
   Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air
   reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard
   counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews
   in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns,
   and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were
   practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior
   lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over
   windows. The main purpose was to remind people that there was a war on
   and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of
   millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large
   part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as
   the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their
   posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country
   that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.^[32]

   The United Service Organizations (USO) was founded in 1941 in response
   to a request from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale and
   recreation services to uniformed military personnel. The USO brought
   together six civilian agencies: the Salvation Army, Young Men's
   Christian Association, Young Women's Christian Association, National
   Catholic Community Service, National Travelers Aid Association, and the
   National Jewish Welfare Board.^[33]

   Women volunteered to work for the Red Cross, the USO and other
   agencies. Other women previously employed only in the home, or in
   traditionally female work, took jobs in factories that directly
   supported the war effort, or filled jobs vacated by men who had entered
   military service. Enrollment in high schools and colleges plunged as
   many high school and college students dropped out to take war
   jobs.^[34]^[35]^[36]

   Various items, previously discarded, were saved after use for what was
   called “recycling” years later. Families were requested to save fat
   drippings from cooking for use in soap making. Neighborhood “scrap
   drives” collected scrap copper and brass for use in artillery shells.
   Milkweed was harvested by children ostensibly for lifejackets.^[37]

Draft[edit]

   A female factory worker in 1942, Fort Worth, Texas. Women entered the
   workforce because men were drafted into the armed forces.

   In 1940, Congress passed the first peace-time draft legislation. It was
   renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It involved questions as to who
   should control the draft, the size of the army, and the need for
   deferments. The system worked through local draft boards comprising
   community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill
   them. There was very little draft resistance.^[38]

   The nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and
   relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943. Industry realized
   that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials
   and foodstuffs more than soldiers. (Large numbers of soldiers were not
   used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940–43 the Army
   often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve
   Corps in order to increase production. Those transferred would return
   to work in essential industry, although they could be called back to
   active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their
   civilian work was deemed essential. There were instances of mass
   releases of men to increase production in various industries. Working
   men who had been classified 4F or otherwise ineligible for the draft
   took second jobs.^[citation needed]

   labor force, the armed forces and unemployment during the war
   years.^[39]

   One contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers, which was
   avoided as much as possible. The drafting of 18-year olds was desired
   by the military but vetoed by public opinion. Racial minorities were
   drafted at the same rate as Whites, and were paid the same, but blacks
   were kept in all-black units. The experience of World War I regarding
   men needed by industry was particularly unsatisfactory—too many skilled
   mechanics and engineers became privates (there is a possibly apocryphal
   story of a banker assigned as a baker due to a clerical error, noted by
   historian Lee Kennett in his book "G.I.") Farmers demanded and were
   generally given occupational deferments (many volunteered anyway, but
   those who stayed at home lost postwar veteran's benefits.)

   Later in the war, in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that
   would be necessary for the invasion of France in 1944, many earlier
   deferment categories became draft eligible.

Pacifism[edit]

   The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God,
   based in Anderson, Indiana, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a
   high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a
   just war because America was attacked.^[40] Likewise the Quakers
   generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served,
   although there were some conscientious objectors.^[41] The Mennonites
   and Brethren continued their pacifism, but the federal government was
   much less hostile than in the previous war. These churches helped their
   young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide
   valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training
   program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young
   women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for
   unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism;
   many worked in mental hospitals.^[42] The Jehovah Witness denomination,
   however, refused to participate in any forms of service, and thousands
   of its young men refused to register and went to prison.^[43]

Suspected disloyalty[edit]

   Civilian support for the war was widespread, with isolated cases of
   draft resistance. The F.B.I. was already tracking elements that were
   suspected of loyalty to Germany, Japan, or Italy, and many were
   arrested in the weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. 7,000 German
   and Italian aliens (who were not U.S. citizens) were moved back from
   the West Coast, along with some 100,000 of Japanese descent. Some enemy
   aliens were held without trial during the entire war. The U.S. citizens
   accused of supporting Germany were given public trials, and often were
   freed.^[44]^[45]^[46]

Population movements[edit]

   There was large-scale migration to industrial centers, especially on
   the West Coast. Millions of wives followed their husbands to military
   camps; for many families, especially from farms, the moves were
   permanent. One 1944 survey of migrants in Portland, Oregon and San
   Diego found that three quarters wanted to stay after the war.^[47] Many
   new military training bases were established or enlarged, especially in
   the South. Large numbers of African Americans left the cotton fields
   and headed for the cities. Housing was increasingly difficult to find
   in industrial centers, as there was no new non-military construction.
   Commuting by car was limited by gasoline rationing. People car pooled
   or took public transportation, which was seriously overcrowded. Trains
   were heavily booked, with uniformed military personnel taking priority,
   so people limited vacation and long-distance travel.

Racial tensions[edit]

   The large-scale movement of blacks from the rural South to defense
   centers in the North (and some in the South) led to small-scale local
   confrontations over jobs and housing shortages. Washington feared a
   major race war. The cities were relatively peaceful; much-feared
   large-scale race riots did not happen, but there was small-scale
   violence, as in the 1943 race riot in Detroit and the anti-Mexican Zoot
   Suit Riots in Los Angeles in 1943.^[48]

   Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender
   division of labor changed somewhat, as the “home” or domestic female
   sphere expanded to include the "home front". Meanwhile the public
   sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of
   military action.^[49]

Employment[edit]

   Wartime mobilization drastically changed the sexual divisions of labor
   for women, as young-able bodied men were sent overseas and war time
   manufacturing production increased. Throughout the war, according to
   Susan Hartmann (1982), an estimated 6.5 million women entered the labor
   force. Women, many of whom were married, took a variety of paid jobs in
   a multitude of vocational jobs, many of which were previously exclusive
   to men. The greatest wartime gain in female employment was in the
   manufacturing industry, where more than 2.5 million additional women
   represented an increase of 140 percent by 1944.^[50] This was catalyzed
   by the “Rosie the Riveter” phenomenon.

   The composition of the marital status of women who went to work changed
   considerably over the course of the war. One in every ten married women
   entered the labor force during the war, and made they represented more
   than three million of the new female workers, while 2.89 million were
   single and the rest widowed or divorced. For the first time in the
   nation's history there were more married women than single women in the
   female labor force. In 1944, thirty-seven percent of all adult women
   were reported in the labor force, but nearly fifty percent of all women
   were actually employed at some time during that year at the height of
   wartime production.^[50] In the same year the unemployment rate hit an
   all-time historical low of 1.2%.^[51]

   According to Hartmann (1982), the women who sought employment, based on
   various surveys and public opinion reports at the time suggests that
   financial reasoning was the justification for entering the labor force;
   however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women's
   desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were more than twice
   as likely to seek jobs.^[50]

   Fundamentally, women were thought to be taking work defined as "men's
   work;" however, the work women did was typically catered to specific
   skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also
   advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity.^[52] For
   example, in a Sperry Corporation recruitment pamphlet the company
   stated, "Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the
   operation of a small drill press." A Ford Motor Company at Willow Run
   bomber plant publication proclaimed, "The ladies have shown they can
   operate drill presses as well as egg beaters." One manager was even
   stated saying, "Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as
   sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than
   women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles and darning
   needs all their lives?"^[53] In these instances, women were thought of
   and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on
   sex-typing.

   Following the war, many women left their jobs voluntarily. One Twin
   Cities Army Ammunition Plant (formally Twin Cities Ordnance Plant)
   worker in New Brighton, Minnesota confessed, "I will gladly get back
   into the apron. I did not go into war work with the idea of working all
   my life. It was just to help out during the war."^[54] Other women were
   laid off by employers to make way for returning veterans who did not
   lose their seniority due to the war.

   By the end of the war, many men who entered into the service did not
   return. This left women to take up sole responsibility of the household
   and provide economically for the family.

Nursing[edit]

   Nursing became a high prestige occupation for young women. A majority
   of female civilian nurses volunteered for the Army Nurse Corps or the
   Navy Nurse Corps. These automatically became officers.^[55] Teenaged
   girls enlisted in the Cadet Nurse Corps. To cope with the growing
   shortage on the homefront, thousands of retired nurses volunteered to
   help out in local hospitals.^[56]^[57]

Volunteer activities[edit]

   Women staffed millions of jobs in community service roles, such as
   nursing, the USO,^[33] and the Red Cross.^[58] Unorganized women were
   encouraged to collect and turn in materials that were needed by the war
   effort. Women collected fats rendered during cooking, children formed
   balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers and also
   created rubber band balls, which they contributed to the war effort.
   Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for
   disasters, such as enemy bombing.

   The Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) mobilized 1,000 civilian women
   to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the
   east coast of the U.S. This was historically significant because flying
   a warplane had always been a male role. No American women flew
   warplanes in combat.^[59]

Baby boom[edit]

   Marriage and motherhood came back as prosperity empowered couples who
   had postponed marriage. The birth rate started shooting up in 1941,
   paused in 1944–45 as 12 million men were in uniform, then continued to
   soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s. This was the “Baby Boom.”

   In a New Deal-like move, the federal government set up the “EMIC”
   program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of
   servicemen below the rank of sergeant.

   Housing shortages, especially in the munitions centers, forced millions
   of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities. Little
   housing had been built in the Depression years, so the shortages grew
   steadily worse until about 1948, when a massive housing boom finally
   caught up with demand. (After 1944 much of the new housing was
   supported by the G.I. Bill.)

   Federal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen, so the
   number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946. In long-range
   terms, divorce rates changed little.^[32]

Housewives[edit]

   Juggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they
   filled while the men were at war, women strained to complete all tasks
   set before them. The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service,
   and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers. Those
   housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle.

   The worst psychological pressure came when sons, husbands, fathers,
   brothers, and fiancés were drafted and sent to faraway training camps,
   preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed.
   Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands' training
   camps.^[32]

Role of minorities[edit]

FEPC[edit]

   The Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) was a federal executive
   order requiring companies with government contracts not to discriminate
   on the basis of race or religion. It assisted African Americans in
   obtaining jobs in industry. Under pressure from A. Philip Randolph's
   growing March on Washington Movement, on June 25, 1941, President
   Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) by
   signing Executive Order 8802. It said “there shall be no discrimination
   in the employment of workers in defense industries or government
   because of race, creed, color, or national origin”. In 1943 Roosevelt
   greatly strengthened FEPC with a new executive order, #9346. It
   required that all government contracts have a non-discrimination
   clause. FEPC was the most significant breakthrough ever for Blacks and
   women on the job front. During the war the federal government operated
   airfields, shipyards, supply centers, ammunition plants, and other
   facilities that employed millions. FEPC rules applied and guaranteed
   equality of employment rights. These facilities shut down when the war
   ended. In the private sector the FEPC was generally successful in
   enforcing non-discrimination in the North, it did not attempt to
   challenge segregation in the South, and in the border region its
   intervention led to hate strikes by angry white workers.^[60]

African American: Double V campaign[edit]

   Participants in the Double V campaign, 1942. From the collection of the
   National Archives and Records Administration.

   The African American community in the United States resolved on a
   Double V Campaign: victory over fascism abroad, and victory over
   discrimination at home. Large numbers migrated from poor Southern farms
   to munitions centers. Racial tensions were high in overcrowded cities
   like Chicago; Detroit and Harlem experienced race riots in 1943.^[61]
   Black newspapers created the Double V Campaign to build black morale
   and head off radical action.^[62]

   Most Black women had been farm laborers or domestics before the
   war.^[63] Despite discrimination and segregated facilities throughout
   the South, they escaped the cotton patch and took blue-collar jobs in
   the cities. Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices
   Committee, the NAACP, and CIO unions, these Black women fought a
   “Double V” campaign—against the Axis abroad and against restrictive
   hiring practices at home. Their efforts redefined citizenship, equating
   their patriotism with war work, and seeking equal employment
   opportunities, government entitlements, and better working conditions
   as conditions appropriate for full citizens.^[64] In the South black
   women worked in segregated jobs; in the West and most of the North they
   were integrated, but wildcat strikes erupted in Detroit, Baltimore, and
   Evansville, Indiana where white migrants from the South refused to work
   alongside black women.^[65]^[66]

Internment[edit]

   Main articles: Japanese American internment, Italian-American
   internment and German-American internment

   In 1942 the War Department demanded that all enemy nationals be removed
   from war zones on the West Coast. The question became how to evacuate
   the estimated 120,000 people of Japanese citizenship living in
   California. Roosevelt looked at the secret evidence available to
   him:^[67] the Japanese in the Philippines had collaborated with the
   Japanese invasion troops; most of the adult Japanese in California had
   been strong supporters of Japan in the war against China. There was
   evidence of espionage compiled by code-breakers that decrypted messages
   to Japan from agents in North America and Hawaii before and after the
   attack on Pearl Harbor. These MAGIC cables were kept secret from all
   but those with the highest clearance, such as Roosevelt. On February
   19, 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 which set up designated
   military areas “from which any or all persons may be excluded.” The
   most controversial part of the order included American born children
   and youth who had dual U.S. and Japanese citizenship. Germans and
   Italians were not interned, as shown from the Korematsu v. United
   States case.

   In February 1943, when activating the 442nd Regimental Combat Team—a
   unit composed mostly of American-born American citizens of Japanese
   descent living in Hawaii—Roosevelt said, “No loyal citizen of the
   United States should be denied the democratic right to exercise the
   responsibilities of his citizenship, regardless of his ancestry. The
   principle on which this country was founded and by which it has always
   been governed is that Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart;
   Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry.” In
   1944, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the legality of the executive order
   in the Korematsu v. United States case. The executive order remained in
   force until December when Roosevelt released the Japanese internees,
   except for those who announced their intention to return to Japan.

   Fascist Italy was an official enemy, and citizens of Italy were also
   forced away from “strategic” coastal areas in California. Altogether,
   58,000 Italians were forced to relocate. They relocated on their own
   and were not put in camps. Known spokesmen for Benito Mussolini were
   arrested and held in prison. The restrictions were dropped in October
   1942, and Italy switched sides in 1943 and became an American ally. In
   the east, however, the large Italian populations of the northeast,
   especially in munitions-producing centers such as Bridgeport and New
   Haven, faced no restrictions and contributed just as much to the war
   effort as other Americans.

Wartime politics[edit]

   Roosevelt easily won the bitterly contested 1940 election, but the
   Conservative coalition maintained a tight grip on Congress. Wendell
   Willkie, the defeated GOP candidate in 1940, became a roving ambassador
   for Roosevelt. After a series of squabbles with Vice President Henry A.
   Wallace, Roosevelt stripped him of his administrative responsibilities
   and dropped him from the 1944 ticket, choosing instead Senator Harry S.
   Truman. Truman was best known for investigating waste, fraud and
   inefficiency in civilian programs.^[68] In very light turnout in 1942
   the Republicans made major gains. In the 1944 election, Roosevelt
   defeated Tom Dewey in a relatively close race that attracted little
   attention.

Propaganda and culture[edit]

   County, Texas. 1943
   Main article: American propaganda during World War II

   Patriotism became the central theme of advertising throughout the war,
   as large scale campaigns were launched to sell war bonds, promote
   efficiency in factories, reduce ugly rumors, and maintain civilian
   morale. The war consolidated the advertising industry's role in
   American society, deflecting earlier criticism.^[69] The media
   cooperated with the federal government in presenting the official view
   of the war. All movie scripts had to be pre-approved.^[70] For example
   there was widespread rumors in the Army to the effect that people on
   the homefront were slacking off. A Private SNAFU film cartoon (released
   to soldiers only) belied that rumor.^[71] Tin Pan Alley produced
   patriotic songs to rally the people.^[72]

Posters[edit]

   Posters helped to mobilize the nation. Inexpensive, accessible, and
   ever-present, the poster was an ideal agent for making war aims the
   personal mission of every citizen. Government agencies, businesses, and
   private organizations issued an array of poster images linking the
   military front with the home front—calling upon every American to boost
   production at work and at home. Some resorted to extreme racial and
   ethnic caricatures of the enemy, sometimes as hopelessly bumbling
   cartoon characters, sometimes as evil, half-human creatures.^[73]

Bond drives[edit]

   A strong aspect of American culture then as now was a fascination with
   celebrities, and the government used them in its eight war bond
   campaigns that called on people to save now (and redeem the bonds after
   the war, when houses, cars and appliances would again be
   available.)^[74] The War Bond drives helped finance the war. Americans
   were challenged to put at least 10% of every paycheck into bonds.^[75]
   Compliance was high, with entire work places earning a special
   “Minuteman” flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the
   “Ten Percent Club”.^[76]

Hollywood[edit]

   Hollywood used the Philippines to show American territory under attack.

   Hollywood studios also went all-out for the war effort, as studios
   encouraged their stars (such as Clark Gable and James Stewart) to
   enlist. Hollywood had military units that made training films – Ronald
   Reagan narrated many of them. Most of all Hollywood made hundreds of
   war movies that, in coordination with the Office of War Information
   (OWI), taught Americans what was happening and who the heroes and the
   villains were. Ninety million people went to the movies every
   week.^[77] Some of the most highly regarded films during this period
   included Casablanca, Mrs. Miniver, Going My Way, and Yankee Doodle
   Dandy. Even before active American involvement in the war, the popular
   Three Stooges comic trio were lampooning the Nazi German leadership,
   and Nazis in general, with a number of short subject films, starting
   with You Nazty Spy! in January 1940, nearly two years before the United
   States was drawn into World War II.

   Cartoons and short subjects were a major sign of the times, as Warner
   Brothers Studios and Disney Studios gave unprecedented aid to the war
   effort by creating cartoons that were both patriotic and humorous, and
   also contributed to remind movie-goers of wartime activities such as
   rationing and scrap drives, war bond purchases, and the creation of
   victory gardens. Warner shorts such as Daffy - The Commando, Draftee
   Daffy, Herr Meets Hare, and Russian Rhapsody are particularly
   remembered for their biting wit and unflinching mockery of the enemy
   (particularly Adolf Hitler, Hideki Tōjō, and Hermann Göring). Their
   cartoons of Private Snafu, produced for the military as “training
   films”, served to remind many military men of the importance of
   following proper procedure during wartime, for their own safety. Hanna
   Barbara also contributed to the war effort with slyly pro US short
   cartoon The Yankee Doodle Mouse with “Lt.” Jerry Mouse as the hero and
   Tom Cat as the “enemy”.

   To heighten the suspense, Hollywood needed to feature attacks on
   American soil, and obtained inspirations for dramatic stories from the
   Philippines. Indeed, the Philippines became a “homefront” that showed
   the American way of life threatened by the Japanese enemy. Especially
   popular were the films Texas to Bataan (1942), Corregidor (1943),
   Bataan (1943), They Were Expendable (1945), and Back to Bataan
   (1945).^[78]

   The OWI had to approve every film before they could be exported. To
   facilitate the process the OWI's Bureau of Motion Pictures (BMP) worked
   with producers, directors and writers before the shooting started to
   make sure that the themes reflected patriotic values. While Hollywood
   had been generally nonpolitical before the war, the liberals who
   controlled OWI encouraged the expression of New Deal liberalism,
   bearing in mind the huge domestic audience, as well as an international
   audience that was equally large.^[79]

Censorship[edit]

   The Office of Censorship published a code of conduct for newspapers,
   magazines, and broadcasters. The office did not use government censors
   to preapprove all articles and radio programs. It relied on voluntary
   cooperation to avoid subjects, such as troop movements, weather
   forecasts, and the travels of the President, that might aid the enemy.
   Journalists did not have to publish positive propaganda, unlike during
   World War I.

Local activism[edit]

   One way to enlist everyone in the war effort was scrap collection
   (called “recycling” decades later). Many everyday commodities were
   vital to the war effort, and drives were organized to recycle such
   products as rubber, tin, waste kitchen fats (a raw material for
   explosives), newspaper, lumber, steel, and many others. Popular phrases
   promoted by the government at the time were “Get into the scrap!” and
   “Get some cash for your trash” (a nominal sum was paid to the donor for
   many kinds of scrap items) and Thomas “Fats” Waller even wrote and
   recorded a song with the latter title. Such commodities as rubber and
   tin remained highly important as recycled materials until the end of
   the war, while others, such as steel, were critically needed at first.
   War propaganda played a prominent role in many of these drives.
   Nebraska had perhaps the most extensive and well-organized drives; it
   was mobilized by the Omaha World Herald newspaper.^[80]

Attacks on US Soil[edit]

   Although the Axis Powers never launched a full scale invasion on the
   US, there were attacks and acts of sabotage on US soil.
     * December 7, 1941- Attack on Pearl Harbor, the reason why the US
       entered the war.
     * December 8, 1941- Battle of Guam, the occupation of the US
       territory of Guam.
     * February 23, 1942- Bombardment of Ellwood, a Japanese sabotage act
       on California.
     * June 3, 1942- Aleutian Islands Campaign, the battle for the then
       Territory of Alaska.
     * June 21–22, 1942- Bombardment of Fort Stevens, the only attack on a
       US military base on the US mainland in World War II.
