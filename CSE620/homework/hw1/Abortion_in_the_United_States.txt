Abortion in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   Abortion in the United States, and abortion-related issues, are the
   subject of intense public and political debate and discussion in the
   United States. Various anti-abortion laws have been on every state
   statute book since at least 1900. Abortion was prohibited in 30 states
   and legal under certain circumstances (such as pregnancies resulting
   from rape or incest) in 20 states. The Supreme Court 1973 decision Roe
   v. Wade invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the
   availability of abortion.

   Roe established that the abortion right "must be considered against
   important state interests in regulation."^[1] Roe established a
   "trimester" threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus
   corresponding to its increasing "viability" (likelihood of survival
   outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states
   were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to
   impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.

   That decision was modified by the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v.
   Casey, which upheld the "central holding" in Roe, but replacing the
   trimester system with the point of fetal viability (whenever it may
   occur) as defining a state's right to override the woman's autonomy.
   Casey also lowered the legal standard to which states would be held in
   justifying restrictions imposed on a woman's rights. Roe had held this
   to be "strict scrutiny"—the traditional Supreme Court test for
   impositions upon fundamental Constitutional rights—whereas Casey
   created a new standard referring to "undue burden", specifically to
   balance the state's and the woman's interests in the case of abortion.

   Before Roe v. Wade, abortion was legal in several areas of the United
   States, but that decision imposed a uniform framework for state
   legislation on the subject, and established a minimal period during
   which abortion must be legal (under greater or lesser degrees of
   restriction throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified
   in Casey, remains nominally in place, although the effective
   availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state.
   Abortion remains one of the most controversial issues in United States
   culture and politics, with the main protagonists most often labelled
   either as "pro-choice" or "pro-life", though shades of opinion exist,
   and most Americans are considered to be somewhere in the middle.^[2]

   The pro-choice position was most popular in the early to mid-1990s ^[3]
   and has since declined somewhat to levels slightly above its popularity
   in the late 1970s and 1980s.^[3]

Terminology[edit]

   Main article: Abortion

   The abortion debate has not typically dealt with a spontaneous
   abortion, which is commonly referred to as a miscarriage until several
   states passed laws in 2013 prohibiting a woman who miscarried from
   receiving medical treatment for 48 hours after diagnosis and forcing
   her to undergo an additional ultrasound prior to her procedure. Before
   this, the abortion debate was most commonly in relation to an "induced
   abortion" of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy, and this
   is also how the term is used in a legal sense.^[4] Another term
   sometimes used is that of an "elective abortion", which is used in
   relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion,
   whether or not she chooses to have one.

History[edit]

Pre-1960s[edit]

   Abortion laws in the U.S. before Roe.
     Illegal. (30)
     Legal in case of rape (1)
     Legal in case of danger to woman's health (2)
     Legal in case of danger to woman's health, rape or incest, or likely
   damaged fetus (13)
     Legal on request (4)

   At the time of the independence of the United States, English common
   law on abortion applied in most of the then states, and abortion was
   not permitted after quickening, that is after the start of fetal
   movements. James Wilson, a framer of the U.S. Constitution, explained
   the view as follows:
   “ With consistency, beautiful and undeviating, human life, from its
     commencement to its close, is protected by the common law. In the
     contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir
     in the womb. By the law, life is protected not only from immediate
     destruction, but from every degree of actual violence, and, in some
     cases, from every degree of danger.^[5]                                ”

   Abortions became illegal by statute, in Britain in 1803 and various
   anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the United States from the
   1820s codifying or expanding the common law rules. In 1821, a
   Connecticut law targeted apothecaries who sold poisons to women for
   purposes of abortion; and New York made post-quickening abortions a
   felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor eight years later. It
   is sometimes argued that the early American abortion laws were
   motivated not by ethical concerns about abortion but by concern about
   the safety of the procedure. However, some legal theorists point out
   that this theory is inconsistent with the fact that abortion was
   punishable regardless of whether any harm befell the pregnant woman and
   the fact that many of the early laws punished not only the doctor or
   abortionist, but also the woman who hired them.^[6]

   A birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th
   centuries presaging the modern debate over women's body rights.^[7] A
   campaign was launched against the movement and the use and availability
   of contraceptives.

   At the same time, the criminalization of abortion accelerated from the
   late 1860s, through the efforts of concerned legislators, doctors, and
   the American Medical Association.^[8] In 1873, Anthony Comstock created
   the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, an institution
   dedicated to supervising the morality of the public, and later that
   year, Comstock successfully influenced the United States Congress to
   pass the Comstock Law, which made illegal the delivery by U.S. mail, or
   by other modes of transportation, of "obscene, lewd, or lascivious"
   material, as well as prohibiting any methods of production or
   publication of information pertaining to the procurement of abortion,
   the prevention conception and the prevention of venereal disease, even
   to students of medicine.^[9] The production, publication, importation,
   and distribution of such materials was suppressed under the Comstock
   Laws as being obscene and similar prohibitions were passed by 24 of the
   then 37 states.^[10]

   By 1900 abortion was a felony in every state. Some states did include
   provisions allowing for abortion in limited circumstances, generally to
   protect the woman's life or to terminate pregnancies arising from rape
   or incest. Abortions continued to occur, however, and increasingly
   became readily available. The American Birth Control League was founded
   by Margaret Sanger in 1921 to promote the founding of birth control
   clinics, to enable women to control their own fertility.^[11]

   In the 1930s, licensed physicians performed an estimated 800,000
   abortions a year.^[12]

Pre-Roe precedents[edit]

   In 1964 Gerri Santoro of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal
   abortion and her photo became the symbol of the pro-choice movement.
   Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to
   provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an
   example, in Chicago, a group known as "Jane" operated a floating
   abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the
   procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on
   how to find "Jane".^[13]

   In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut struck
   down one of the remaining contraception Comstock laws in Connecticut
   and Massachusetts. However, Griswold only applied to marital
   relationships. Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972) extended its holding to
   unmarried persons as well. Following Griswold case, the American
   College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued a medical
   bulletin accepting a recommendation from 6 years earlier which
   clarified that conception is implantation, not fertilization; and
   consequently birth control methods that prevented implantation became
   classified as contraceptives, not abortifacients.

   In 1967, Colorado became the first state to decriminalize abortion in
   cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent
   physical disability of the woman. Similar laws were passed in
   California, Oregon, and North Carolina. In 1970, Hawaii became the
   first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman,^[14] and
   New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th
   week of pregnancy. Similar laws were soon passed in Alaska and
   Washington. A law in Washington, D.C., which allowed abortion to
   protect the life or health of the woman, was challenged in the Supreme
   Court in 1971 in United States v. Vuitch. The court upheld the law,
   deeming that "health" meant "psychological and physical well-being,"
   essentially allowing abortion in Washington, DC. By the end of 1972, 13
   states had a law similar to that of Colorado, while Mississippi allowed
   abortion in cases of rape or incest only and Alabama and Massachusetts
   allowed abortions only in cases where the womans's physical health was
   endangered. In order to obtain abortions during this period, women
   would often travel from a state where abortion was illegal to states
   where it was legal. The legal position prior to Roe v. Wade was that
   abortion was illegal in 30 states and legal under certain circumstances
   in 20 states.^[15]

   In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize
   opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. In 1966, the
   National Conference of Catholic Bishops assigned Monsignor James T.
   McHugh to document efforts to reform abortion laws, and anti-abortion
   groups began forming in various states in 1967. In 1968, McHugh led an
   advisory group which became the National Right to Life
   Committee.^[16]^[17] The forerunner of the NARAL Pro-Choice America was
   formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to
   abortion.^[18] Following Roe v. Wade, in late 1973 NARAL became the
   National Abortion Rights Action League.

Roe v. Wade[edit]

   Main article: Roe v. Wade
   The United States Supreme Court membership in 1973.

   In deciding Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court ruled
   that a Texas statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save
   the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its
   decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights
   falls under the right to privacy. In its opinion it listed several
   landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy
   implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to
   abortion in all cases:

     State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has
     both logical and biological justifications. If the State is
     interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so
     far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is
     necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.^[19]

   The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right
   to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to
   abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion
   doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health
   reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological
   well-being.

   A central issue in the Roe case (and in the wider abortion debate in
   general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception,
   birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an
   attempt at resolving this issue, noting: "We need not resolve the
   difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the
   respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable
   to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the
   development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to
   the answer." Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under
   English and American common law and statutes, "the unborn have never
   been recognized ...as persons in the whole sense" and thus the fetuses
   are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to
   life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So rather
   than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court
   simply declared that the State has a "compelling interest" in
   protecting "potential life" at the point of viability.

Jane Roe and Mary Doe[edit]

   "Jane Roe" of the landmark Roe v. Wade lawsuit, whose real name is
   Norma McCorvey, is now an anti-abortion advocate. McCorvey writes that
   she never had the abortion and became the "pawn" of two young and
   ambitious lawyers who were looking for a plaintiff who they could use
   to challenge the Texas state law prohibiting abortion. However,
   attorney Linda Coffee says she does not remember McCorvey having any
   hesitancy about wanting an abortion.^[20]

   "Mary Doe" of the companion Doe v. Bolton lawsuit, the mother of three
   whose real name is Sandra Cano, maintains that she never wanted or had
   an abortion and that she is "ninety-nine percent certain that [she] did
   not sign" the affidavit to initiate the suit.^[21]

Later judicial decisions[edit]

   In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court abandoned
   Roe's strict trimester framework.^[22] Instead adopting the standard of
   undue burden for evaluating state abortion restrictions,^[23] but
   reemphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of
   liberty and privacy protected under the constitution: "Constitutional
   protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives
   from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares
   that no State shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
   without due process of law." The controlling word in the cases before
   us is "liberty."^[24]

   The Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On
   April 18, 2007 it issued a ruling in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart,
   involving a federal law entitled the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of
   2003 which President George W. Bush had signed into law. The law banned
   intact dilation and extraction, which opponents of abortion rights
   referred to as "partial-birth abortion," and stipulated that anyone
   breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The
   United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of
   5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of
   abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony
   Kennedy, was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and
   the two recent appointees, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.

Current legal situation[edit]

Federal legislation[edit]

   Since 1995, led by Congressional Republicans, the U.S. House of
   Representatives and U.S. Senate have moved several times to pass
   measures banning the procedure of intact dilation and extraction, also
   commonly known as partial birth abortion. After several long and
   emotional debates on the issue, such measures passed twice by wide
   margins, but President Bill Clinton vetoed those bills in April 1996
   and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health
   exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health
   exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the Doe v. Bolton
   decision defined "health" in vague terms, justifying any motive for
   obtaining an abortion. Subsequent Congressional attempts at overriding
   the veto were unsuccessful.

   On October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the House again approved a
   measure banning the procedure, called the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban
   Act. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in
   prison and face civil lawsuits for performing such an abortion. A woman
   who undergoes the procedure cannot be prosecuted under the measure. The
   measure contains an exemption to allow the procedure if the woman's
   life is threatened. On October 21, 2003, the United States Senate
   passed the same bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats
   joining in support. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush on
   November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in
   several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme
   Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case Gonzales
   v. Carhart on April 18, 2007, signaling a substantial change in the
   Court's approach to abortion law.^[25] The 5-4 ruling said the Partial
   Birth Abortion Ban Act does not conflict with previous Court decisions
   regarding abortion.

   The current judicial interpretation of the U.S. Constitution regarding
   abortion in the United States, following the Supreme Court of the
   United States's 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, and subsequent
   companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by
   the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late
   term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate
   the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the
   procedure.^[26]

   The key, deliberated article of the U.S. Constitution is the Fourteenth
   Amendment, which states that
   “ All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
     the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
     State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which
     shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
     States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
     property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
     jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.^[27]                    ”

   The official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in
   1983 after extensive hearings on the Human Life Amendment (proposed by
   Senators Orrin Hatch and Thomas Eagleton), stated what substantially
   remains true today:
   “ Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal
     barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a
     mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her
     pregnancy.^[28]                                                       ”

   One aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been
   determining when the fetus is "viable" outside the womb as a measure of
   when the "life" of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being
   protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court
   in Roe v. Wade, viability was defined as "potentially able to live
   outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is
   usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier,
   even at 24 weeks." When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current
   medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24
   weeks. Advances over the past three decades have allowed fetuses that
   are a few weeks less than 24 weeks old to survive outside the mother's
   womb. These scientific achievements, while life-saving for premature
   babies, have made the determination of being "viable" somewhat more
   complicated.

   As of 2006, the youngest child to survive a premature birth in the
   United States was a girl born at Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu,
   Hawaii at 21 weeks and 3 days gestation gestational age.^[29] Because
   of the split between federal and state law, legal access to abortion
   continues to vary somewhat by state. Geographic availability, however,
   varies dramatically, with 87 percent of U.S. counties having no
   abortion provider.^[30] Moreover, due to the Hyde Amendment, many state
   health programs do not cover abortions; currently 17 states (including
   California, Illinois and New York) offer or require such coverage.^[31]

   The legality of abortion in the United States is frequently a major
   issue in nomination battles for the U.S. Supreme Court. However,
   nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings,
   because it is an issue that may come before them as judges.

   The Unborn Victims of Violence Act, commonly known as "Laci and
   Conner's Law" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President
   Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone
   who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus).
   It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating
   to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy
   among pro-choice advocates. They view it as a potential step in the
   direction of banning abortion.

State-by-state legal status[edit]

   Main articles: Abortion in the United States by state and Types of
   abortion restrictions in the United States
   The Guttmacher Institute found that state restrictions on abortion
   greatly increased in 2011.

   Various states have laws on abortion, some of which refer to as
   feticide. On March 6, 2006, South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds signed
   into law a pro-life statute which made performing abortions a felony,
   and that law was subsequently repealed in a November 7, 2006
   referendum.^[32] On February 27, 2006, Mississippi’s House Public
   Health Committee voted to approve a ban on abortion, and that bill died
   after the House and Senate failed to agree on compromise
   legislation.^[33] Several states have enacted "trigger laws" which
   "would take effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned."^[34] North Dakota HB
   1572 or the Personhood of Children Act, which passed the North Dakota
   House of Representatives on February 18, 2009, but was later defeated
   in the North Dakota Senate, aimed to allocate rights to "the pre-born,
   partially born", and if passed, would likely have been used to
   challenge Roe v. Wade.^[35] On February 15, 2012, the Virginia House of
   Delegates passed House Bill 1 in a vote of 66-32, that effectively
   outlaws all Virginia abortions by declaring that the rights of persons
   apply from the moment sperm and egg unite. It also passed a second bill
   in a 63-36 vote, that requires women to have a transvaginal ultrasound
   before undergoing abortions.^[36]

   In addition, some states have sought to ban abortion by means of an
   amendment to the state constitution, three of which have already
   reached the ballot for a vote. Colorado citizens voted on Amendment 48
   on November 4, 2008, and it failed to pass, with 73.21% voting against
   it and 26.79% voting for it.^[37] A similar initiative, Amendment 62,
   made the Colorado ballot on November 2, 2010, where it failed again,
   this time 70.53% to 29.47%.^[38] On November 8, 2011, Initiative 26, a
   "personhood" measure that would have banned all abortions and some
   forms of contraception, was defeated on the Mississippi ballot, 57.87%
   voting "no" to 42.13%.^[39]^[40] All three of these amendments made it
   to the ballot through a citizen initiative process, as opposed to being
   referred to the ballot by their state legislatures.

   These amendments, dubbed “personhood amendments,” have so far contained
   far-reaching language that go beyond simply banning abortion. They
   define personhood as beginning from the moment of conception and/or
   fertilization, which would potentially outlaw forms of birth control,
   in addition to potentially banning in-vitro fertilization. The umbrella
   organization Personhood USA, based in Colorado and founded by Keith
   Mason, was responsible for getting Amendments 48 and 62 onto the ballot
   in Colorado.^[41] They plan to get another amendment onto the ballot in
   2012, this time with slightly revised wording composed by legal analyst
   Gualberto Garcia Jones. Personhood USA also plans on pushing for such
   amendments in Montana and Oregon.^[42]

   Other states are considering personhood amendments banning abortion,
   some through legislative methods and others through citizen initiative
   campaigns. Among these states are Florida, Ohio, Georgia, Texas, and
   Arkansas.^[43]^[44]^[45]

Qualifying requirements for abortion providers[edit]

   Qualifying requirements for performing abortions vary from state to
   state.^[46] Currently, California, Oregon, Montana, Vermont, and New
   Hampshire allow qualified non-physician health professionals, such as
   physicians' assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse
   midwives, to do first-trimester aspiration abortions, and to prescribe
   drugs for medical abortions. Additionally, Washington State, New
   Mexico, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and
   New Jersey allow qualified non-physicians to prescribe drugs for
   medical abortions only. In all other states, only licensed physicians
   may perform abortions.^[47]

Statistics[edit]

   Main article: Abortion statistics in the United States

   Because reporting of abortions is not mandatory, statistics are of
   varying reliability. The Centers For Disease Control (CDC)^[48]
   regularly compiles these statistics.

Number of abortions in United States[edit]

   material may be challenged and removed. (February 2014)

   The annual number of legal induced abortions in the United States
   doubled between 1973 and 1979, and peaked in 1990. There was a slow but
   steady decline through the 1990s. Overall, the number of annual
   abortions decreased by 6% between 2000 and 2009, with temporary spikes
   in 2002 and 2006.^[49]

   According to the Guttmacher Institute, since 1973, roughly 50 million
   legal induced abortions have been performed in the United States.^[50]

   By 2011, abortion rate in the United States dropped to its lowest point
   since the Supreme Court legalized the procedure. According to a study
   performed by Guttmacher Institute, long-acting contraceptive methods
   were having a significant impact in reducing unwanted pregnancies.
   There were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women of
   child-bearing age. That was a 13 percent decrease from 2008's numbers
   and slightly higher than the rate in 1973, when the Supreme Court's Roe
   v. Wade decision legalized abortion. The study indicated a long-term
   decline in the abortion rate. The rate has dropped significantly from
   its all-time high in 1981, when there were roughly 30 abortions for
   every 1,000 women of reproductive age. The overall number of abortions
   also fell 13 percent from 2008 to nearly 1.1 million in 2011." In 2013,
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported a decline
   in abortion rates.^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]

   In 2012, according to a report by the New York City Department of
   Health and Mental Hygiene, in New York City there were more black
   babies aborted (31,328) than were born (24,758). There was a total of
   73,815 abortions in 2012 in New York City; 42.4% were of black
   descent.^[55]^[56]^[57]^[58]

   According to the data published by the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC), 39,052 African American babies and 14,529 white
   babies were aborted in Mississippi between 1995 and 2010. 71.67% of the
   babies aborted in Mississippi were black and 26.6% were white. The
   total number of abortions (from all races) in Mississippi from 1995 to
   2010 was 54,484. Whites outnumber African Americans in Mississippi
   1.6-to-1.^[59]

Medical abortions[edit]

   A Guttmacher Institute survey of abortion providers estimated that
   early medical abortions accounted for 17% of all nonhospital abortions
   and slightly over one-quarter of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in
   the United States in 2008.^[60] Medical abortions voluntarily reported
   to the CDC by 34 reporting areas (excluding Alabama, California,
   Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland,
   Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania,
   Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and published in its annual
   abortion surveillance reports have increased every year since the
   September 28, 2000 FDA approval of mifepristone (RU-486): 1.0% in 2000,
   2.9% in 2001, 5.2% in 2002, 7.9% in 2003, 9.3% in 2004, 9.9% in 2005,
   10.6% in 2006, 13.1% in 2007, 15.8% in 2008, 17.1% in 2009 (25.2% of
   those at less than 9 weeks gestation).^[61] Medical abortions accounted
   for 32% of first trimester abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in
   the United States in 2008.^[62]

Abortions and ethnicity[edit]

   Abortion rates are much more common among women in the U.S. In
   2000-2001, the rates among black and Hispanic women were 49 per 1,000
   and 33 per 1,000, respectively, vs. 13 per 1,000 among non-Hispanic
   white women. Note that this figure includes all women of reproductive
   age, including women that are not pregnant. In other words, these
   abortion rates reflect the rate at which U.S. women of reproductive age
   have an abortion each year.^[63] While White women obtain 60% of all
   abortions, African American women are three times more likely to have
   an abortion.^[64]

   In 2004, the rates of abortion by ethnicity in the U.S. were 50
   abortions per 1,000 black women, 28 abortions per 1,000 Hispanic women,
   and 11 abortions per 1,000 white women.^[65]

Reasons for abortions[edit]

   Another study, in 1998, revealed that in 1987-1988 women reported the
   following as their primary reasons for choosing an abortion:^[66]^[67]
   The source of this information, takes findings into account from 27
   nations including the United States, and therefore these findings may
   not be typical for any one nation.
     * 25.9% Want to postpone childbearing.
     * 21.3% Cannot afford a baby
     * 14.1% Has relationship problem or partner does not want pregnancy
     * 12.2% Too young; parent(s) or other(s) object to pregnancy
     * 10.8% Having a child will disrupt education or job
     * 7.9% Want no (more) children
     * 3.3% Risk to fetal health
     * 2.8% Risk to maternal health
     * 2.1% Other

   According to a 1987 study that included specific data about late
   abortions (i.e. abortions “at 16 or more weeks' gestation”),^[68] women
   reported that various reasons contributed to their having a late
   abortion:
     * 71% Woman did not recognize she was pregnant or misjudged gestation
     * 48% Woman found it hard to make arrangements for abortion
     * 33% Woman was afraid to tell her partner or parents
     * 24% Woman took time to decide to have an abortion
     * 8% Woman waited for her relationship to change
     * 8% Someone pressured woman not to have abortion
     * 6% Something changed after woman became pregnant
     * 6% Woman did not know timing is important
     * 5% Woman did not know she could get an abortion
     * 2% A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy
     * 11% Other.

   In 2000, cases of rape or incest accounted for 1% of abortions.^[69]

   A 2004 study by the Guttmacher Institute reported that women listed the
   following amongst their reasons for choosing to have an abortion:^[67]
     * 74% Having a baby would dramatically change my life
     * 73% Cannot afford a baby now
     * 48% Do not want to be a single mother or having relationship
       problems
     * 38% Have completed my childbearing
     * 32% Not ready for another child
     * 25% Do not want people to know I had sex or got pregnant
     * 22% Do not feel mature enough to raise another child
     * 14% Husband or partner wants me to have an abortion
     * 13% Possible problems affecting the health of the fetus
     * 12% Concerns about my health
     * 6% Parents want me to have an abortion
     * 1% Was a victim of rape
     * less than 0.5% Became pregnant as a result of incest

   A 2008 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) shows that rates of
   unintended pregnancy are highest among Blacks, Hispanics, and women
   with lower SES.^[70]
     * 70% of all pregnancies among Black women were unintended
     * 57% of all pregnancies among Hispanic women were unintended
     * 42% of all pregnancies among White women were unintended

When women have abortions (by gestational age)[edit]

Maternal death[edit]

   By US statistics risk of maternal death by abortion is lower than
   childbirth through at least 21 weeks' gestation.^[71]^[72]

Public opinion[edit]

   See also: Societal attitudes towards abortion, United States pro-choice
   movement and United States pro-life movement

   Leading up to the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court
   decision in January 2013, a majority of Americans believed abortion
   should be legal in all or most cases, according to a poll by NBC News
   and the Wall Street Journal.^[73] As well, approximately 70% of
   respondents oppose Roe v. Wade being overturned, which is the highest
   percentage on this question since 1989.^[73] A poll by the Pew Research
   Center yielded similar results.^[74] Moreover, 48% of Republicans
   opposed overturning Roe, compared to 46% who supported overturning
   it.^[74]

   Gallup notes that abortion attitudes are shifting. Gallup declared in
   May 2010 that more Americans identifying as "pro-life" is "the new
   normal", while also noting that there had been no increase in
   opposition to abortion. It suggested that political polarization may
   have prompted more Republicans to call themselves "pro-life".^[75] The
   terms "pro-choice" and "pro-life" do not always reflect a political
   view or fall along a binary; in one Public Religion Research Institute
   poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" while
   almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life". The same poll
   found that 56% of Americans were in favor of legal access to abortion
   in all or some cases.^[76]

   A January 2003 CBS News/New York Times poll examined whether Americans
   thought abortion should be legal or not, and found variations in
   opinion which depended upon party affiliation and the region of the
   country.^[78] The margin of error is +/- 4% for questions answered of
   the entire sample ("overall" figures) and may be higher for questions
   asked of subgroups (all other figures).^[78]

By trimester of pregnancy[edit]

   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in January 2003 asked about the legality of
   abortion by trimester, using the question, "Do you think abortion
   should generally be legal or generally illegal during each of the
   following stages of pregnancy?" ^[79] This same question was also asked
   by Gallup in March 2000 and July 1996.^[80]^[81] Polls indicates
   general support of abortion during the first trimester although support
   drops dramatically for abortion during the second and third trimester.

By circumstance or reasons[edit]

   According to Gallup's long-time polling on abortion, the majority of
   Americans are neither strictly Pro-Life or Pro-Choice; it depends upon
   circumstances. Gallup polling from 1996 to 2009 consistently reveals
   that when asked the question, "Do you think abortions should be legal
   under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or
   illegal in all circumstances?", Americans repeatedly answer 'legal only
   under certain circumstances'. According to the poll, in any given year
   48-57% say legal only under certain circumstances (for 2009, 57%),
   21-34% say legal under any circumstances (for 2009, 21%), and 13-19%
   illegal in all circumstances (for 2009, 18%), with 1-7% having no
   opinion (for 2009, 4%).^[80]

   "Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal
   only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances?"

   circumstances Illegal in all circumstances No opinion

   2007 May 10–13 26% 55% 17% 1%
   2006 May 8–11 30% 53% 15% 2%

   According to the aforementioned poll,^[80] Americans differ drastically
   based upon situation of the pregnancy, suggesting they do not support
   unconditional abortions. Based on two separate polls taken May 19–21,
   2003, of 505 and 509 respondents respectively, Americans stated their
   approval for abortion under these various circumstances:

                       Poll Criteria                         Total Poll A Poll B
When the woman's life is endangered                          78%   82%    75%
When the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest              65%   72%    59%
When the child would be born with a life-threatening illness 54%   60%
                                                                          48%
When the child would be born mentally disabled               44%   50%    38%
When the woman does not want the child for any reason        32%   41%    24%

   Another separate trio of polls taken by Gallup in 2003, 2000, and
   1996,^[80] revealed public support for abortion as follows for the
   given criteria:

   Poll criteria 2003 Poll 2000 Poll 1996 Poll
   When the woman's life is endangered 85% 84% 88%
   When the woman's physical health is endangered 77% 81% 82%
   When the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest 76% 78% 77%
   When the woman's mental health is endangered 63% 64% 66%
   When there is evidence that the baby may be physically impaired 56% 53%
   53%
   When there is evidence that the baby may be mentally impaired 55% 53%
   54%
   When the woman or family cannot afford to raise the child 35% 34% 32%

   Gallup furthermore established public support for many issues supported
   by the Pro-Life community and opposed by the Pro-Choice community:^[80]

   Legislation 2003 Poll 2000 Poll 1996 Poll
   A law requiring doctors to inform patients about alternatives to
   abortion before performing the procedure 88% 86% 86%

   A law requiring that the husband of a married woman be notified if she
   decides to have an abortion 64% 72% 70% 73%

   An October 2007 CBS News poll explored under what circumstances
   Americans believe abortion should be allowed, asking the question,
   "What is your personal feeling about abortion?" The results were as
   follows:^[79]

   Permitted in all cases Permitted, but subject to greater restrictions
   than it is now Only in cases such as rape, incest, or to save the
   woman's life Only permitted to save the woman's life Never Unsure
   26% 16% 34% 16% 4% 4%

Additional polls[edit]

   Results of Gallup opinion poll in USA since 1975 - legal restriction of
   abortion^[82]
     * A June 2000 Los Angeles Times survey found that, although 57% of
       polltakers considered abortion to be murder, half of that 57%
       believed in allowing women access to abortion. The survey also
       found that, overall, 65% of respondents did not believe abortion
       should be legal after the first trimester, including 72% of women
       and 58% of men. Further, the survey found that 85% of Americans
       polled supported abortion in cases of risk to a woman's physical
       health, 54% if the woman's mental health was at risk, and 66% if a
       congenital abnormality was detected in the fetus.^[83]
     * A July 2002 Public Agenda poll found that 44% of men and 42% of
       women thought that "abortion should be generally available to those
       who want it", 34% of men and 35% of women thought that "abortion
       should be available, but under stricter than limits it is now", and
       21% of men and 22% of women thought that "abortion should not be
       permitted".^[84]
     * A January 2003 ABC News/Washington Post poll also examined
       attitudes towards abortion by gender. In answer to the question,
       "On the subject of abortion, do you think abortion should be legal
       in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal
       in all cases?", 25% of women responded that it should be legal in
       "all cases", 33% that it should be legal in "most cases", 23% that
       it should be illegal in "most cases", and 17% that it should be
       illegal in "all cases". 20% of men thought it should be legal in
       "all cases", 34% legal in "most cases", 27% illegal in "most
       cases", and 17% illegal in "all cases".^[84]
     * Most Fox News viewers favor both parental notification as well as
       parental consent, when a minor seeks an abortion. A Fox News poll
       in 2005 found that 78% of people favor a notification requirement,
       and 72% favor a consent requirement.^[85]
     * An April 2006 Harris poll on Roe v. Wade, asked, "In 1973, the U.S.
       Supreme Court decided that states' laws which made it illegal for a
       woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were
       unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should
       have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to
       the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or
       oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making
       abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?", to which 49% of
       respondents indicated favor while 47% indicated opposition. The
       Harris organization has concluded from this poll that "49 percent
       now support Roe vs. Wade."^[86]
     * Two polls were released in May 2007 asking Americans "With respect
       to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice
       or pro-life?" May 4 through 6th, a CNN poll found 45% said
       pro-choice and 50% said pro-life.^[87] Within the following week, a
       Gallup poll found 50% responding pro-choice and 44% pro-life.^[88]

Partial birth abortion[edit]

   See also: Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act

   "Partial-Birth" abortion is a non-medical term for a procedure called
   intact dilation and extraction used by those who oppose the procedure
   due to the opinion that the fetus has developed. A Rasmussen Reports
   poll four days after the Supreme Court's opinion in Gonzales v. Carhart
   found that 40% of respondents "knew the ruling allowed states to place
   some restrictions on specific abortion procedures." Of those who knew
   of the decision, 56% agreed with the decision and 32% were
   opposed.^[89] An ABC poll from 2003 found that 62% of respondents
   thought "partial-birth abortion" should be illegal; a similar number of
   respondents wanted an exception "if it would prevent a serious threat
   to the woman's health." Additional polls from 2003 found between 47–70%
   in favor of banning this type of abortion and between 25–40%
   opposed.^[90]

   Gallup has repeatedly queried the American public on this issue, as
   seen on its Abortion page:^[80]

   Legislation 2003 2000 2000 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996
   A law which would make it illegal to perform a specific abortion
   procedure conducted in the last six months (or second and/or third
   trimester) of pregnancy known by some opponents as a "partial birth
   abortion," except in cases necessary to save the life of the mother 70%
   63% 66% 64% 61% 61% 55% 57%

Abortion financing[edit]

   State Medicaid coverage of medically necessary abortion services.
   Navy blue: Medicaid covers medically necessary abortion for low-income
   women through legislation
   Royal blue: Medicaid covers medically necessary abortions for
   low-income women under court order
   Gray: Medicaid denies abortion coverage for low-income women except for
   cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment.

   The abortion debate has also been extended to the question of who pays
   the medical costs of the procedure, with some states using the
   mechanism as a way of reducing the number of abortions. The cost of an
   abortion varies depending on factors such as location, facility,
   timing, and type of procedure. In 2005, a nonhospital abortion at 10
   weeks’ gestation ranged from $90 to $1,800 (average: $430), whereas an
   abortion at 20 weeks’ gestation ranged from $350 to $4,520 (average:
   $1,260). Costs are higher for a medical abortion than a first-trimester
   surgical abortion.

Medicaid[edit]

   The Hyde Amendment is a federal legislative provision barring the use
   of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except for rape and
   incest.^[91] The provision, in various forms, was in response to Roe v.
   Wade, and has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills
   since 1976, and represented the first major legislative success by the
   pro-life movement. The law requires that states cover abortions under
   Medicaid in the event of rape, incest, and life endangerment. Based on
   the federal law:
     * 32 states and DC fund abortions through Medicaid only in the cases
       of rape, incest, or life endangerment. SD covers abortions only in
       the cases of life endangerment, which does not comply with federal
       requirements under the Hyde Amendment. IN, UT and WI have expanded
       coverage to women whose physical health is jeopardized, and IA, MS,
       UT and VA also include fetal abnormality cases.

     * 17 states (AK, AZ, CA, CT, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, MT, NJ, NM, NY, OR,
       VT, WA, WV) use their own funds to cover all or most “medically
       necessary” abortions sought by low-income women under Medicaid, 13
       of which are required by State court orders to do so.^[92]

Private insurance[edit]

     * 5 states (ID, KY, MO, ND, OK) restrict insurance coverage of
       abortion services in private plans: OK limits coverage to life
       endangerment, rape or incest circumstances; and the other four
       states limit coverage to cases of life endangerment.
     * 12 states (CO, IL, KY, MA, MS, NE, ND, OH, PA, RI, SC, VA) restrict
       abortion coverage in insurance plans for public employees, with CO
       and KY restricting insurance coverage of abortion under any
       circumstances.
     * U.S. laws also ban federal funding of abortions for federal
       employees and their dependents, Native Americans covered by the

       women with disabilities covered by Medicare.^[93]

Positions of U.S. political parties[edit]

   Though members of both major political parties come down on either side
   of the issue, the Republican Party is often seen as being pro-life,
   since the official party platform opposes abortion and considers unborn
   children to have an inherent right to life. Republicans for Choice
   represents the minority of that party. In 2006 pollsters found that 9%
   of Republicans favor the availability of abortion in most
   circumstances.^[94] Of Republican National Convention delegates in
   2004, 13% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 38%
   believed that it should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 17%
   of all Republican voters believed that abortion should be generally
   available to those who want it, while 38% believed that it should not
   be permitted.^[95]

   The Democratic Party platform considers abortion to be a woman's right.
   Democrats for Life of America represents the minority of that party. In
   2006 pollsters found that 74% of Democrats favor the availability of
   abortion in most circumstances.^[94] However, a Zogby International
   poll in 2004 found that 43% of all Democrats believed that abortion
   "destroys a human life and is manslaughter."^[96] Of Democratic
   National Convention delegates in 2004, 75% believed that abortion
   should be generally available, and 2% believed that abortion should not
   be permitted. The same poll showed that 49% of all Democratic voters
   believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want
   it, while 13% believed that it should not be permitted.^[97]

   The U.S. Green Party supports abortion as a woman's right.

   The U.S. Libertarian Party takes no position on abortion, but the Party
   opposes any government funding of abortion.

   In the United States the abortion issue has become deeply politicized:
   in 2002, 84% of state Democratic platforms supported the right to
   having an abortion while 88% of state Republican platforms opposed it.
   This divergence also led to Christian Right organizations like
   Christian Voice, Christian Coalition and Moral Majority having an
   increasingly strong role in the Republican Party. This opposition has
   been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act: in 1973 Jesse Helms
   introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote
   abortion overseas, and in 1984 the Mexico City Policy prohibited
   financial support to any overseas organization that performed or
   promoted abortions. The "Mexico City Policy" was revoked by President
   Bill Clinton and subsequently reinstated by President George W. Bush.
   President Barack Obama overruled this policy by Executive Order on
   January 23, 2009.^[98]

   The official platforms of the major political parties in the US are as
   follows:

The U.S. Republican Party[edit]

     * 2012: "We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and
       endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's
       protections apply to unborn children. We oppose using public
       revenues to promote or perform abortion or fund organizations which
       perform or advocate it and will not fund or subsidize health care
       which includes abortion coverage. We support the appointment of
       judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of
       innocent human life. We oppose the nonconsensual withholding or
       withdrawal of care or treatment, including food and water, from
       people with disabilities, including newborns, as well as the
       elderly and infirm, just as we oppose active and passive euthanasia
       and assisted suicide."^[99]
     * 2008: "Faithful to the first guarantee of the Declaration of
       Independence, we assert the inherent dignity and sanctity of all
       human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental
       individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a
       human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse
       legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s
       protections apply to unborn children. We oppose using public
       revenues to promote or perform abortion and will not fund
       organizations which advocate it. We support the appointment of
       judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity and
       dignity of innocent human life..."^[100]
     * 2004: "As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee
       of the Declaration of Independence. That is why we say the unborn
       child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be
       infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution
       and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth
       Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to
       have legislative and judicial protection of that right against
       those who perform abortions. We oppose using public revenues for
       abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. We
       support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family
       values and the sanctity of innocent human life."^[101]
     * 2000: "Ban abortion with Constitutional amendment. We say the
       unborn child has a fundamental right to life. We support a human
       life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation that
       the 14th Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children. Our
       purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that
       right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using public
       revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which
       advocate it. We support the appointment of judges who respect the
       sanctity of innocent human life." ^[102]
     * 2000: "Alternatives like adoption, instead of punitive action. Our
       goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind
       of support, material and otherwise, they need for themselves and
       for their babies, not to be punitive towards those for whose
       difficult situation we have only compassion. We oppose abortion,
       but our pro-life agenda does not include punitive action against
       women who have an abortion. We salute those who provide
       alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services." ^[102]
     * 1996: "The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life
       which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the
       Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the
       Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.^[103]

The U.S. Democratic Party[edit]

     * 2012: "The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe
       v. Wade and a woman's right to make decisions regarding her
       pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of
       ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or
       undermine that right. Abortion is an intensely personal decision
       between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is
       no place for politicians or government to get in the way."^[104]
     * 2008: "The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe
       v. Wade and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion,
       regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to
       weaken or undermine that right.The Democratic Party also strongly
       supports access to affordable family planning services and
       comprehensive age-appropriate sex education which empower people to
       make informed choices and live healthy lives. We also recognize
       that such health care and education help reduce the number of
       unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for
       abortions. The Democratic Party also strongly supports a woman's
       decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of
       programs for pre and post natal health care, parenting skills,
       income support, and caring adoption programs." ^[105]
     * 2004: "Support right to choose even if mother cannot pay. Because
       we believe in the privacy and equality of women, we stand proudly
       for a woman's right to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and
       regardless of her ability to pay. We stand firmly against
       Republican efforts to undermine that right. At the same time, we
       strongly support family planning and adoption incentives. Abortion
       should be safe, legal, and rare."^[106]
     * 2000: "Choice is a fundamental, constitutional right. Democrats
       stand behind the right of every woman to choose. We believe it is a
       constitutional liberty. This year’s Supreme Court ruling show us
       that eliminating a woman’s right to choose is only one justice
       away. Our goal is to make abortion more rare, not more dangerous.
       We support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive
       family life education, and policies that support healthy
       childbearing." ^[107]
     * 1996: "Our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare,
       not more difficult and more dangerous. We support contraceptive
       research, family planning, comprehensive family life education, and
       policies that support healthy childbearing. For four years in a
       row, we have increased support for family planning. The abortion
       rate is dropping. Now we must continue to support efforts to reduce
       unintended pregnancies, and we call on all Americans to take
       personal responsibility to meet this important goal."^[108]

Effects of legalization[edit]

   The risk of death due to legal abortion has fallen considerably since
   legalization in 1973, due to increased physician skills, improved
   medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy.^[109] From
   1940 through 1970, deaths of pregnant women during abortion fell from
   nearly 1,500 to a little over 100.^[109] According to the Centers for
   Disease Control, the number of women who died in 1972 from illegal
   abortion was thirty-nine (39).^[110] In 1960, Dr. Mary Calderone, a
   former director of Planned Parenthood, said:
   “ Abortion is no longer a dangerous procedure. This applies not just to
     therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so-called
     illegal abortions as done by physician. In 1957 there were only 260
     deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind ...90
     percent of all illegal abortions are presently being done by physicians
     ...Whatever trouble arises usually arises from self-induced abortions,
     which comprise approximately 8 percent, or with the very small
     percentage that go to some kind of non-medical abortionist...^[111]    ”

   The Roe effect is an hypothesis which suggests that since supporters of
   abortion rights cause the erosion of their own political base by having
   fewer children, the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the
   restriction or illegalization of abortion. The legalized abortion and
   crime effect is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion
   reduces crime, because unwanted children are more likely to become
   criminals.

   Since Roe v Wade, there have been numerous attempts to reverse the
   decision. In the 2011 election season, Mississippi placed an amendment
   on the ballot that redefine how the state viewed abortion. The
   personhood amendment defined personhood as "every human being from the
   moment of fertilization, cloning or the functional equivalent thereof".
   If passed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in the
   state.^[112]

   On July 11, 2012, a Mississippi federal judge ordered an extension of
   his temporary order to allow the state's only abortion clinic to stay
   open. The order will stay in place until U.S. District Judge Daniel
   Porter Jordan III can review newly drafted rules on how the Mississippi
   Department of Health will administer a new abortion law. The law in
   question came into effect on July 1.^[113]

                effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the

                "(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of
                the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest
                in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate
                the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related
                to maternal health.
                "(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in
                promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life
                may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion
                except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical
