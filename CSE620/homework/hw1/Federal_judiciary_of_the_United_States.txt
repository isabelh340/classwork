   The federal judiciary of the United States is one of the three co-equal
   branches of the Federal government of the United States organized under
   the United States Constitution and laws of the federal government.
   Article III of the Constitution requires the establishment of a Supreme
   Court and permits the Congress to create other federal courts, and
   place limitations on their jurisdiction. Federal judges are appointed
   by the President with the consent of the Senate to serve until they
   resign, are impeached and convicted, retire, or die.

   The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme
   Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally
   an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which
   means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting of
   writs of certiorari. There is generally no right of appeal to the
   Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state
   governments or some cases between the federal government and a state)
   it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.

   The United States courts of appeals are the intermediate federal
   appellate courts. They operate under a system of mandatory review which
   means they must hear all appeals of right from the lower courts. In
   some cases, Congress has diverted appellate jurisdiction to specialized
   courts, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.

   The United States district courts (one in each of the 94 federal
   judicial districts, as well three territorial courts) are general
   federal trial courts, although in many cases Congress has diverted
   original jurisdiction to specialized courts, such as the Court of
   International Trade, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the
   Alien Terrorist Removal Court, or to Article I or Article IV tribunals.
   The district courts usually have jurisdiction to hear appeals from such
   tribunals (unless, for example, appeals are to the Court of Appeals for
   the Federal Circuit.)

Other tribunals[edit]

   Besides these federal courts, described as Article III courts, there
   are other adjudicative bodies described as Article I or Article IV
   courts in reference to the article of the Constitution from which the
   court's authority stems.

   There are a number of Article I courts with appellate jurisdiction over
   specific subject matter including the Court of Appeals for Veterans
   Claims and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, as well as
   Article I courts with appellate jurisdiction over specific geographic
   areas such as the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The Article I
   courts with original jurisdiction over specific subject matter include
   the bankruptcy courts (for each district court), the immigration
   courts, the Court of Federal Claims, and the Tax Court.

   Article IV courts include the High Court of American Samoa and
   territorial courts such as the District Court for the Northern Mariana
   Islands, District Court of Guam, and District Court of the Virgin
   Islands.

Judges[edit]

   Further information: United States federal judge

   Federal judges, like Supreme Court Justices, are appointed by the
   President with the consent of the Senate to serve until they resign,
   are impeached and convicted, retire, or die.

   In April 2013, about 10 percent of federal seats were vacant, with 85
   of 856 positions unfilled and 4 vacancies on the prestigious Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.^[1] The high vacancy rate
   has been attributed to politics, particularly Senate filibustering of
   potential appointees by Republican Senators.^[1] In many cases there is
   no nominee for the position; however, the Senate has a tradition of
   senatorial courtesy in which nominees are only considered if the home
   senators approve.^[2] In May 2013 Congressional Research Service
   published a paper analyzing the vacancies and appointment process.^[3]

   Under Article I of the federal Constitution, Congress also has the
   power to establish other tribunals, which are usually quite
   specialized, within the executive branch to assist the President in the
   execution of his powers. Judges who staff them normally serve terms of
   fixed duration, as do magistrate judges who assist Article III judges.
   Judges in Article I tribunals attached to executive branch agencies are
   referred to as administrative law judges (ALJs) and are generally
   considered to be part of the executive branch even though they exercise
   quasi-judicial powers. With limited exceptions, they cannot render
   final judgments in cases involving life, liberty, and private property
   rights, but may make preliminary rulings subject to review by an
   Article III judge.

Administration[edit]

     * The Judicial Conference of the United States is the policymaking
       body of the U.S. federal courts. The Conference is responsible for
       creating and revising federal procedural rules pursuant to the
       Rules Enabling Act.
     * The Administrative Office of the United States Courts is the
       primary support agency for the U.S. federal courts. It is directly
       responsible to the Judicial Conference. The AO prepares the
       judiciary's budget, provides and operates secure court facilities,
       and provides the clerical and administrative staff essential to the
       efficient operation of the courts.
     * The Federal Judicial Center is the primary research and education
       agency for the U.S. federal courts.
     * The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transfers and
       consolidates cases in multiple judicial districts that share common
       factual issues.
     * The United States Marshals Service is responsible for providing
       protection for the federal judiciary and transporting federal
       prisoners.
     * The Supreme Court Police provide security for the Supreme Court
       building.

Legal procedure[edit]

   The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution as placing some
   additional restrictions on the federal courts. For example, the
   doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and standing prohibit district courts
   from issuing advisory opinions. Other doctrines, such as the abstention
   doctrine and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine limit the power of lower
   federal courts to disturb rulings made by state courts. The Erie
   doctrine requires federal courts to apply substantive state law to
   claims arising from state law (which may be heard in federal courts
   under supplemental or diversity jurisdiction). In difficult cases, the
   federal courts must either guess as to how a court of that state would
   decide the issue or, if that state accepts certified questions from
   federal courts when state law is unclear or uncertain, ask an appellate
   court of that state to decide the issue.

   Notably, the only federal court that can issue proclamations of federal
   law that bind state courts is the Supreme Court itself. Decisions of
   the lower federal courts, whether on issues of federal law or state law
   (i.e., the question was not certified to a state court), are persuasive
   but not binding authority in the states in which those federal courts
   sit.^[4]

   Some commentators assert that another limitation upon federal courts is
   executive nonacquiescence in judicial decisions, where the executive
   simply refuses to accept them as binding precedent.^[5]^[6] In the
   context of administration of U.S. internal revenue laws by the Internal
   Revenue Service, nonacquiescences (published in a series of documents
   called Actions on Decisions) "generally do not affect the application
   of stare decisis or the rule of precedent". The IRS "will recognize
   these principles and generally concede issues accordingly during
   administrative proceedings." In rare cases, however, the IRS may
   continue to litigate a legal issue in a given circuit even where the
   IRS has already lost a case on that issue in that circuit.^[7]

History[edit]

   Congress has the authority to regulate the judicial system as a whole,
   though much of this power has been devolved to the courts themselves.
   The first courts were established through the Judiciary Act of 1789,
   which provided for the first Article III judges.

   Virtually all U.S. law schools offer an elective course that focuses
   specifically on the powers and limitations of U.S. federal courts, with
   coverage of topics such as justiciability, abstention doctrines, the
   abrogation doctrine, and habeas corpus.^[8]
