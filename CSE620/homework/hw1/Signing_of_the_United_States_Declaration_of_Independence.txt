   The signatures on the Declaration of Independence

   Fifty-six delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia
   signed the United States Declaration of Independence, a statement
   announcing that the thirteen American colonies then at war with Great
   Britain were now independent states, and thus no longer a part of the
   British Empire. Although the wording of the Declaration was approved by
   Congress on July 4, the date of its signing has been disputed. Most
   historians have concluded that it was signed nearly a month after its
   adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.

Date of signing[edit]

   The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, by
   Armand-Dumaresq, (c. 1873) which has been hanging in the White House
   since the late 1980s.

   The date that the Declaration was signed has long been the subject of
   debate. Within a decade after the event, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin
   Franklin, and John Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed
   by Congress on July 4, 1776.^[1] This seemed to be confirmed by the
   signed copy of the Declaration, which is dated July 4. Additional
   support was provided by the Journals of Congress, the official public
   record of the Continental Congress. When the proceedings for 1776 were
   first published in 1777, the entry for July 4, 1776, stated that the
   Declaration was engrossed (the official copy was handwritten) and
   signed on that date.^[2]

   In 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been
   signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present,
   including several who were not even elected to Congress until after
   that date.^[3] "[N]o person signed it on that day nor for many days
   after", he later wrote.^[4] Although Jefferson and Adams disagreed with
   McKean, his claim gained support when the Secret Journals of Congress
   were published in 1821.^[5] The Secret Journals contained two
   previously unpublished entries about the Declaration. The entry for
   July 19 reads:

     Resolved That the Declaration passed on the 4th be fairly engrossed
     on parchment with the title and stile of "The unanimous declaration
     of the thirteen united states of America" & that the same when
     engrossed be signed by every member of Congress.^[6] ^[7]

   The entry for August 2 stated:

     The declaration of Independence being engrossed & compared at the
     table was signed by the Members.^[8] ^[9]

   The Syng inkstand was used during the signing of the Declaration

   In 1884, historian Mellen Chamberlain argued that these entries
   indicated that the famous signed version of the Declaration had been
   created following the July 19 resolution, and had not been signed by
   Congress until August 2.^[10] Historian John Hazelton confirmed in 1906
   that many of the signers had not been present in Congress on July 4,
   that the fifty-six signers had never been together as a group, and that
   some delegates must have added their signatures even after August
   2.^[11] While it is possible that Congress signed a document on July 4
   that has since been lost, historians do not think that this is
   likely.^[12]

   Although most historians have accepted the argument that the
   Declaration was not signed on July 4, and that the engrossed copy was
   not created until after July 19, legal historian Wilfred Ritz wrote in
   1986 that "the historians and scholars are wrong".^[13] Ritz argued
   that the engrossed copy of the Declaration was signed by Congress on
   July 4, as Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin had stated, and that it was
   implausible that all three men had been mistaken.^[14] Ritz believed
   that McKean's testimony was questionable,^[15] and that historians had
   misinterpreted the July 19 resolution. According to Ritz, this
   resolution did not call for a new document to be created, but rather
   for the existing one to be given a new title, which was necessary after
   New York had joined the other twelve states in declaring independence.
   Ritz argued that the phrase "signed by every member of Congress" in the
   July 19 resolution meant that delegates who had not signed the
   Declaration on the 4th were now required to do so.^[16]

   Ritz argued that about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on
   July 4, and that the others signed on or after August 2.^[17]
   Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates
   signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not
   present added their names later.^[18]

Signer details[edit]

   Of the approximately fifty delegates who are thought to have been
   present in Congress during the voting on independence in early July
   1776,^[19] eight never signed the Declaration: John Alsop, George
   Clinton, John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, Robert R. Livingston, John
   Rogers, Thomas Willing, and Henry Wisner.^[20] Clinton, Livingston, and
   Wisner were attending to duties away from Congress when the signing
   took place. Willing and Humphreys, who voted against the resolution of
   independence, were replaced in the Pennsylvania delegation before the
   August 2 signing. Rogers had voted for the resolution of independence
   but was no longer a delegate on August 2. Alsop, who favored
   reconciliation with Great Britain, resigned rather than add his name to
   the document.^[21] Dickinson refused to sign, believing the Declaration
   premature, but remained in Congress. Although George Read had voted
   against the resolution of independence, and Robert Morris had
   abstained, they both signed the Declaration.

   The most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of John
   Hancock, who, as President of Congress, presumably signed first.^[22]
   Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and John Hancock
   emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for
   "signature".^[23] Two future presidents, Thomas Jefferson and John
   Adams, were among the signatories. Edward Rutledge (age 26) was the
   youngest signer, and Benjamin Franklin (age 70) was the oldest signer.
   John Hancock's now-iconic signature on the Declaration is nearly 5
   inches (13 cm) long.^[24]

   Some delegates, including Samuel Chase, were away on business when the
   Declaration was debated, but were back in Congress to sign on August 2.
   Other delegates were present when the Declaration was debated but added
   their names after August 2, including Elbridge Gerry, Lewis Morris,
   Oliver Wolcott, and Thomas McKean. Richard Henry Lee and George Wythe
   were in Virginia during July and August, but returned to Congress and
   signed the Declaration probably in September and October,
   respectively.^[25]

   As new delegates joined the Congress, they were also allowed to sign.
   Eight men signed the Declaration who did not take seats in Congress
   until after July 4: Matthew Thornton, William Williams, Benjamin Rush,
   George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, George Ross, and Charles
   Carroll of Carrollton.^[26] Because of a lack of space, Thornton was
   unable to sign next to the other New Hampshire delegates; he instead
   placed his signature at the end of the document, on the lower
   right.^[27]

   The first published version of the Declaration, the Dunlap broadside,
   did not list the signers (except for John Hancock's and Charles
   Thompson's.) The public did not learn who had signed the engrossed copy
   until January 18, 1777, when the Congress ordered that an
   "authenticated copy", including the names of the signers, be sent to
   each of the thirteen states.^[28] This copy, the Goddard Broadside, was
   the first to list all the signers.^[29]

Stories and legends[edit]

   Various legends about the signing of the Declaration emerged years
   later, when the document had become an important national symbol. In
   one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having
   signed the Declaration, must now "all hang together", and Benjamin
   Franklin replied: "Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most
   assuredly we shall all hang separately." The quote did not appear in
   print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.^[30]

       4, followed by a formal signing on August 2, was at least
       "plausible". Wills (Inventing America, 342–43) called Boyd's
       reasoning "farfetched", arguing that a July 4 signing "makes no
