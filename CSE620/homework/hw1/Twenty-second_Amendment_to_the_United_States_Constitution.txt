Text[edit]

     Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President
     more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President,
     or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which
     some other person was elected President shall be elected to the
     office of the President more than once. But this article shall not
     apply to any person holding the office of President when this
     article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any
     person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as
     President, during the term within which this article becomes
     operative from holding the office of President or acting as
     President during the remainder of such term.

     Section 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have
     been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the
     legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven
     years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.

History[edit]

   In this 1944 poster, Franklin Roosevelt (left) successfully campaigned
   for a fourth term. He was the only president who served more than two
   terms.

   Historians point to George Washington's decision not to seek a third
   term as evidence that the founders saw a two-term limit as a bulwark
   against a monarchy, although his Farewell Address suggests that he was
   not seeking re-election because of his age. Thomas Jefferson also
   contributed to the convention of a two-term limit when he wrote in
   1807, "if some termination to the services of the chief Magistrate be
   not fixed by the Constitution, or supplied by practice, his office,
   nominally four years, will in fact become for life."^[1] Jefferson’s
   immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe, adhered to the
   two-term principle as well. In a new political atmosphere several years
   later, Andrew Jackson continued the precedent.

   Prior to Franklin D. Roosevelt, few Presidents attempted to serve for
   more than two terms. Ulysses S. Grant sought a third term in 1880 after
   serving from 1869 to 1877, but narrowly lost his party's nomination to
   James Garfield. Grover Cleveland tried to serve a third term (and
   second consecutive term) in 1896, but did not have enough support in
   the wake of the Panic of 1893. Cleveland lost support to the Silverites
   led by William Jennings Bryan, and declined to head the Gold Democrat
   ticket, though he did endorse the Gold Democrats. Theodore Roosevelt
   succeeded to the presidency upon William McKinley's assassination and
   was himself elected in 1904 to a full term, serving from 1901 to 1909.
   He sought to be elected to a (non-consecutive) term in 1912 but lost to
   Woodrow Wilson. Wilson himself tried to get a third term in
   1920,^[citation needed] by deadlocking the convention. Wilson
   deliberately blocked the nomination of his Secretary of the Treasury
   and son-in-law, William Gibbs McAdoo. However, Wilson was too unpopular
   even within his own party at the time, and James M. Cox was nominated.
   In 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the only president to be elected
   to a third term; supporters cited the war in Europe as a reason for
   breaking with precedent.

   In the 1944 election, during World War II, Roosevelt won a fourth term
   but suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died in office the following
   year. Thus, Franklin Roosevelt was the only President to have served
   more than two terms. Near the end of the 1944 campaign, Republican
   nominee Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, announced support of
   an amendment that would limit future presidents to two terms. According
   to Dewey, "Four terms, or sixteen years, is the most dangerous threat
   to our freedom ever proposed."^[2]

   The Republican-controlled 80th Congress approved a 22nd Amendment in
   March 1947;^[3] it was signed by Speaker of the House Joseph W. Martin
   and acting President pro tempore of the Senate William F. Knowland.^[4]
   Nearly four years later, in February 1951, enough states ratified the
   amendment for its adoption. While excluded from the amendment's
   restrictions, then-President Harry S. Truman ultimately decided not to
   seek another term in 1952.^[3]

   Ratification was completed on February 27, 1951. The amendment was
   subsequently ratified by the following states:
    1. North Carolina (February 28, 1951)
    2. South Carolina (March 13, 1951)
    3. Maryland (March 14, 1951)
    4. Florida (April 16, 1951)
    5. Alabama (May 4, 1951)

   In addition, the following states voted to reject the amendment:
    1. Oklahoma (June 1947)
    2. Massachusetts (June 9, 1949)

   The following states took no action to consider the amendment:
    1. Arizona
    2. Kentucky
    3. Rhode Island
    4. Washington
    5. West Virginia

   (Neither Alaska nor Hawaii had yet achieved statehood status at the
   time.)

Attempts at repeal[edit]

   According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of Western Kentucky
   University (who was opposed to repealing the amendment), "ever since
   1985, when Ronald Reagan was serving in his second term as president,
   there have been repeated attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment to the
   Constitution, which limits each president to two terms."^[6] In
   addition, several congressmen, including Democrats Rep. Barney Frank,
   Rep. José Serrano,^[7] Rep. Howard Berman, and Sen. Harry Reid,^[8] and
   Republicans Rep. Guy Vander Jagt,^[9] Rep. David Dreier^[10] and Sen.
   Mitch McConnell^[11] have introduced legislation to repeal the
   Twenty-second Amendment, but each resolution died before making it out
   of its respective committee. Other alterations have been proposed,
   including replacing the absolute two term limit with a limit of no more
   than two consecutive terms and giving Congress the power to grant a
   dispensation to a current or former president by way of a supermajority
   vote in both houses.^[citation needed]

   On January 4, 2013, Rep. José Serrano once again introduced H.J.Res. 15
   proposing an Amendment to repeal the 22nd Amendment, as he has done
   every two years since 1997.^[12]

Interaction with the Twelfth Amendment[edit]

   There is a point of contention regarding the interpretation of the
   Twenty-second Amendment as it relates to the Twelfth Amendment,
   ratified in 1804, which provides that "no person constitutionally
   ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice
   President of the United States."

   While it is clear that under the Twelfth Amendment the original
   constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply
   to both the President and Vice President, it is unclear whether a
   two-term president could later serve as Vice President. Some argue^[13]
   that the Twenty-second Amendment and Twelfth Amendment bar any two-term
   president from later serving as Vice President as well as from
   succeeding to the presidency from any point in the United States
   presidential line of succession. Others contend^[14]^[15] that the
   Twelfth Amendment concerns qualification for service, while the
   Twenty-second Amendment concerns qualifications for election, and thus
   a former two-term president is still eligible to serve as vice
   president. The practical applicability of this distinction has not been
   tested, as no former president has ever sought the vice presidency, and
   thus the courts have never been required to make a judgment regarding
   the matter.

Affected individuals[edit]

   The amendment specifically did not apply to the sitting president
   (Harry S. Truman) at the time it was proposed by Congress. Truman, who
   had served nearly all of Franklin D. Roosevelt's unexpired fourth term
   and who had been elected to a full term in 1948, withdrew as a
   candidate for re-election in 1952 after losing the New Hampshire
   primary. Had he won, he would have been eligible to run again in
   1956.^[citation needed]

   Since the amendment's ratification, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M.
   Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama
   have been elected president twice. The only president who could have
   served more than eight years was Lyndon B. Johnson.^[16]^[17] He became
   President in 1963 when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, served the
   final 14 months (less than two years) of Kennedy's term, was elected
   president in 1964, and ran briefly for re-election in 1968 but chose to
   withdraw from the race after barely winning the New Hampshire primary
   and polls showed him losing Wisconsin's. Gerald Ford became president
   on August 9, 1974, and served the final 29 months (more than two years)
   of Richard Nixon's unexpired term. Ford, who lost to Jimmy Carter in
   1976 would have been eligible to be elected in his own right only once.
