Energy policy of the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Hoover dam

   The energy policy of the United States is determined by federal, state
   and local entities in the United States, which address issues of energy
   production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and
   gas mileage standards. Energy policy may include legislation,
   international treaties, subsidies and incentives to investment,
   guidelines for energy conservation, taxation and other public policy
   techniques.

   Several mandates have been proposed over the years, such as gasoline
   will never exceed $1.00/gallon (Nixon), and the United States will
   never again import as much oil as it did in 1977 (Carter),^[1] but no
   comprehensive long-term energy policy has been proposed, although there
   has been concern over this failure.^[2] Three Energy Policy Acts have
   been passed, in 1992, 2005, and 2007,^[3] which include many provisions
   for conservation, such as the Energy Star program, and energy
   development, with grants and tax incentives for both renewable energy
   and non-renewable energy.

   There is also criticism that federal energy policies since the 1973 oil
   crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting
   expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and
   technology realities. Instead of providing stable rules that support
   basic research while leaving plenty of scope for American
   entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidential
   administrations have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions
   that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful,
   without adequate consideration of the dollar costs, environmental
   costs, or national security costs of their actions.^[4]^[5]

   State-specific energy-efficiency incentive programs also play a
   significant role in the overall energy policy of the United States.^[6]
   The United States refused to endorse the Kyoto Protocol, preferring to
   let the market drive CO[2] reductions to mitigate global warming, which
   will require CO[2] emission taxation. The administration of Barack
   Obama has proposed an aggressive energy policy reform, including the
   need for a reduction of CO[2] emissions, with a cap and trade program,
   which could help encourage more clean renewable, sustainable energy
   development.^[7] Thanks to new technologies such as fracking, the
   United States has in 2014 resumed its former role as the top oil
   producer in the world.^[8]

History[edit]

   See also: History of the petroleum industry in the United States and
   History of coal mining in the United States
   Jonah Sperm Whale Oil, an old label

   In the Colonial era the energy policy of the United States was for free
   use of standing timber for heating and industry. In the 19th century,
   new emphasis was placed on access to coal and its use for transport,
   heating and industry. Whales were rendered into lamp oil.^[9] Later,
   coal gas was fractionated for use as lighting and town gas. Natural gas
   was first used in America for lighting in 1816.,^[10] it has grown in
   importance for use in homes, industry, and power plants, but natural
   gas production reached its U.S. peak in 1973,^[11] and the price has
   risen significantly since then.

   Coal provided the bulk of the US energy needs well into the 20th
   century. Most urban homes had a coal bin and a coal fired furnace. Over
   the years these were replaced with oil furnaces, not because of it
   being cheaper but because it was easier and safer.^[12] Coal remains
   far cheaper than oil. The biggest use of oil has come from the
   development of the automobile.
   US oil reserves increased until 1970, and then began to decline.

   Oil became increasingly important to the United States, and, from the
   early 1940s, the US government and oil industry entered into a mutually
   beneficial collaboration to control global oil resources.^[13] By 1950,
   oil consumption exceeded that of coal.^[14]^[15] The abundance of oil
   in California, Texas, Oklahoma, as well as in Canada and Mexico,
   coupled with its low cost, ease of transportation, high energy density,
   and use in internal combustion engines, lead to its increasing use.
   Following World War II, oil heating boilers took over from coal burners
   along the Eastern Seaboard; diesel locomotives took over from
   coal-fired steam engines under dieselisation; oil-fired electricity
   plants were built; petroleum-burning buses replaced electric streetcars
   in a GM driven conspiracy, for which they were found guilty, and
   citizens bought gasoline powered cars. Interstate Highways helped make
   cars the major means of personal transportation.^[16] As oil imports
   increased, US foreign policy was inexorably drawn into Middle East
   politics, supporting oil-producing Saudi Arabia and patrolling the sea
   lanes of the Persian Gulf.^[17]
   Grand Coulee Dam

   Hydroelectricity was the basis of Nikola Tesla's introduction of the
   U.S. electricity grid, starting at Niagara Falls, NY in 1883.^[18]
   Electricity generated by major dams like the Jensen Dam, TVA Project,
   Grand Coulee Dam and Hoover Dam still produce some of the lowest-priced
   ($0.08/kWh), clean electricity in America. Rural electrification strung
   power lines to many more areas.^[9]^[19]

   Utilities have their rates set to earn a revenue stream that provides
   them with a constant 10% – 13% rate of return based on operating costs.
   Increases or decreases of the operating costs of electricity production
   are passed directly through to the consumers.^[20]^[unreliable source?]

   The federal government provided substantially larger subsidies to
   fossil fuels than to renewables in the 2002–2008 period. Subsidies to
   fossil fuels totaled approximately $72 billion over the study period,
   representing a direct cost to taxpayers. Subsidies for renewable fuels,
   totaled $29 billion over the same period.^[21]

   In some cases, the U.S. has used its energy policy as a means to pursue
   other international goals. Richard Heinberg, a professor from Santa
   Rosa, California argues that a declassified CIA document shows that the
   U.S. used oil prices as leverage against the economy of the Soviet
   Union. Specifically, he argues that the U.S. intentionally worked with
   Saudi Arabia during the Reagan administration to keep oil prices low,
   thus decreasing the purchasing power of the Soviet Union's petroleum
   export industry. When combined with other U.S. efforts to drain Soviet
   resources, this was eventually a major cause in the dissolution of the
   Soviet Union.^[22]

Energy independence?[edit]

   See also: 1973 oil crisis and U.S. Energy Independence
   Trend of net energy imports into the United States (US Energy
   Information Administration)
   United States oil production peaked in 1970 and began to decline. In
   2005 imports peaked at 60% of consumption.

   The United States receives approximately 84% of its energy from fossil
   fuels.^[23] This energy is used for transport, industry, and domestic
   use. The remaining portion comes primarily from Hydro and Nuclear
   stations.^[24] Americans constitute less than 5% of the world's
   population, but consumes 26% of the world's energy^[25] to produce 26%
   of the world's industrial output. They account for about 25% of the
   world's petroleum consumption, while producing only 6% of the world's
   annual petroleum supply.^[26]

   Almost all of Canada’s energy exports go to the United States, making
   it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports. Canada is the top
   source of U.S. imports of oil, gas. and electricity.^[27]

Petroleum[edit]

   In 2012, the US produced 60% of the petroleum it used, the remainder
   being imported. The largest sources of imported oil were Canada, Saudi
   Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Russia. Oil imports into the US peaked
   in 2005, when imports supplied 60% of US consumption; they have
   declined since, due both to increased domestic oil production, and
   reduced consumption.^[28]

   The 1973 oil embargo highlighted the vulnerability of the United States
   to oil supply disruptions when it depends on imports from nations that
   are either politically unstable or opposed to US interests. Perceived
   remedies include measures to reduce demand for petroleum (such as
   conservation or alternative fuels), increase the supply of petroleum
   (by increasing domestic production, or maintaining petroleum reserves),
   or enhance the reliability of foreign imports (through foreign
   policy).^[29] The Federal Department of Energy was started to direct
   the various approaches.^[30]

   Conservation. A National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph (88 km/h) was
   imposed to help reduce consumption, and Corporate Average Fuel Economy
   (aka CAFE) standards were enacted to downsize automobile
   categories.^[31] Year-round Daylight Saving Time was imposed, the
   United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created and the National
   Energy Act of 1978 was introduced. Alternate forms of energy and
   diversified oil supply resulted.^[32]

   Re-design of cities, telecommuting, mass transit, higher housing
   density and walking could also reduce automobile fuel consumption.^[33]
   Carpooling, flexcars, Smart cars, and shorter commutes could all reduce
   fuel use.^[34]^[35]

   Increasing supply. The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve was
   created to augment supply in case of a national emergency.^[32]

   Alternative fuels. Two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is in the
   transportation sector.^[36] The US – an important export country for
   food stocks – converted approximately 18% of its grain output to
   ethanol in 2008. Across the US, 25% of the whole corn crop went to
   ethanol in 2007.^[37] The percentage of corn going to biofuel is
   expected to go up.^[38] In 2006, U.S. Senators introduced the BioFuels
   Security Act.^[39]

   The proposal has been made for a hydrogen economy, in which cars and
   factories would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. However, energy
   would have to be used to produce the hydrogen, and hydrogen cars have
   been called one of the least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce
   greenhouse gases.^[40]^[41] Other plans include making society carbon
   neutral and using renewable energy, including solar, wind, and methane
   sources.

   It has been suggested that automobiles could be powered by the
   following forms of energy: 60% by grid electricity, 20% by biofuels,
   and 20% by direct solar. Re-design of cities, telecommuting, mass
   transit, higher housing density and walking could also reduce
   automobile fuel consumption.^[33]

   Enhance reliability of foreign sources One purpose of American foreign
   policy, especially in the Middle East, is commonly seen as securing the
   continued flow of petroleum exports from the region.

   The proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada is widely perceived as a
   way to enhance the security of US petroleum supply.^[42]

Natural gas[edit]

   The United States is a net importer of natural gas, most of it by
   pipeline from Canada, with a smaller amount of LNG from other sources.
   Net gas imports into the US peaked in 2007, when the country imported
   16.4 percent of the natural gas it consumed, and was the world's
   largest net importer of natural gas.^[43] By 2013, despite growing use
   of natural gas in the US, net imports had fallen to 5.0 percent of
   consumption.^[44]

Coal[edit]

   The United States mines more coal than it uses, and is an exporter of
   coal.^[45]

Electricity[edit]

   The United States is a net importer of electricity from Canada, and a
   net exporter to Mexico. Overall, in 2012 the US had net electricity
   imports of 47 thousand gigawatt-hours, which was less than 1.2% of the
   electrical power generated within the US.^[46]

   Nuclear power in the United States depends largely on imported uranium.
   In 2011, US uranium mining provided 8 percent of the uranium
   concentrate loaded into nuclear reactors.^[47] The remainder was
   imported. Principal sources of imported uranium were Russia, Canada,
   Australia, Kazakhstan, and Namibia.^[48]

Energy consumption[edit]

   US energy consumption by primary consuming sector

   Buildings and their construction consume more energy than
   transportation or industrial applications, and because buildings are
   responsible for the largest portion of greenhouse emissions, they have
   the largest impact on man-made climate change. The AIA has proposed
   making buildings carbon neutral by 2030, meaning that the construction
   and operation of buildings will not require fossil fuel energy or emit
   greenhouse gases, and having the U.S. reduce CO[2] emissions to 40 to
   60% below 1990 levels by 2050.^[49]

   Energy consumption can vary widely from state to state in the U.S. In
   2012 for example, there was a large gap in electricity consumption by
   state between the top three states - Louisiana (1254 kWh/mo.),
   Tennessee (1217 kWh/mo.) and Mississippi (1193 kWh/mo.) - and the
   bottom three states - Maine (531 kWh/mo.), Hawaii (544 kWh/mo.) and
   Vermont (565 kWh/mo.).^[50]

   When President Carter created the U.S. Department of Energy in 1977,
   one of their first successful projects was the Weatherization
   Assistance Program.^[51] During the last 30 years, this program has
   provided services to more than 5.5 million low-income families. On
   average, low-cost weatherization reduces heating bills by 31% and
   overall energy bills by $358 per year at current prices. Increased
   energy efficiency and weatherization spending has a high return on
   investment.^[52]

   The “Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007” has a significant
   impact on U.S. Energy Policy. It includes funding to help improve
   building codes, and will make it illegal to sell incandescent light
   bulbs, as they are less efficient than fluorescents and LEDs.^[3]

   Technologies such as passive solar building design and zero energy
   buildings (ZEB) have demonstrated significant new-construction energy
   bill reductions. The “Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007”
   includes funding to increase the popularity of ZEBs, photovoltaics, and
   even a new solar air conditioning program. Many energy-saving measures
   can be added to existing buildings as retrofits, but others are only
   cost-effective in new construction, which is why building code
   improvements are being encouraged. The solution requires both improved
   incentives for energy conservation, and new energy sources.

   The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 increases average gas
   mileage to 35 mpg by 2020. The current administration and 2007
   legislation are encouraging the near-term use of plug-in electric cars,
   and hydrogen cars by 2020. Toyota has suggested that their
   third-generation 2009 Prius^[53] may cost much less than the current
   model.^[54] Larger advanced-technology batteries have been suggested to
   make it plug-in rechargeable. Photovoltaics are an option being
   discussed to extend its daytime electric driving range. Improving solar
   cell efficiency factors will continue to make this a progressively
   more-cost-effective option.

Sources[edit]

   US energy consumption by primary source

   About 86% of all types of energy used in the United States is derived
   from fossil fuels. In 2007, the largest source of the country's energy
   came from petroleum (40%), followed by natural gas (24%) and coal
   (23%). The remaining 15% was supplied by nuclear power, hydroelectric
   dams, and miscellaneous renewable sources.^[55] Amory Lovins says that
   the sharp and steady cost reductions in solar power has been a
   "stunning market success". He says that solar, wind and cheap natural
   gas have significantly reduced the prospects of coal and nuclear power
   plants around the world. John Rowe, chair of Exelon (the largest
   nuclear power producer in the US), has said that the nuclear
   renaissance is dead.^[56]

Petroleum[edit]

   U.S. Imports of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products (Thousand Barrels),
   1981–2010.

   The US consumes, in 2006, 20.8 million barrels (3,310,000 m^3) of
   petroleum a day,^[57] of which 9 million barrels (1,400,000 m^3) is
   motor gasoline. Transportation has the highest consumption rates,
   accounting for approximately 68.9% of the oil used in the United States
   in 2006,^[58] and 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch
   report. With approximately 5% of the world's population, the United
   States is responsible for approximately 25% of annual global oil
   consumption and according to 2008 estimates has a per-person daily
   consumption rate more than double that of the European Union.^[59]^[60]
   Automobiles are the single largest consumer of oil,^[61] consuming 40%,
   and are also the source of 20% of the nation's greenhouse gas
   emissions.^[62]
   An offshore oil platform

   The USA has about 22 billion barrels (3.5×10^9 m^3) reserves while
   consuming about 7.6 billion barrels (1.21×10^9 m^3) per year.^[57] This
   has created pressure for additional drilling. European gasoline prices
   were artificially raised to $4 per gallon through taxation long before
   they reached $4/gallon in the U.S., leading to better fuel
   economy.^[63]^[64]

   Problems associated with oil supply include volatile oil prices,
   increasing world and domestic petroleum product demand, dependence on
   unstable imported foreign oil, falling domestic production (peak oil),
   and declining infrastructure, like the Alaska pipeline and oil
   refineries.

   American dependence on imports grew from 10% in 1970 to 65% by the end
   of 2004.^[65] The Energy Information Administration projects that U.S.
   oil imports will remain flat and consumption will grow, so net imports
   will decline to 54% of U.S. oil consumption by 2030.^[66]

   The subject of continued exploration for offshore drilling in the
   United States is a perennial debate, one which was heavily influenced
   in 2010 by the BP Macondo oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Coal[edit]

   Main article: Coal power in the United States
   US coal regions

   America is self-sufficient in coal.^[67] Indeed, it has several hundred
   years' supply of it.^[68]^[69] The United States trend in coal use has
   been rising from 1950 through 2007, when coal production and
   consumption more than doubled.^[70] The population of the US has almost
   doubled in this time period as well, while the per capita energy use
   has been declining since 1978.^[71]^[72]

   Most electricity (52% in 2000) in the country is generated from
   coal-fired power plants:^[9] in 2006, more than 90% of coal consumed
   was used to generate electricity. In 1950, about 19% percent of the
   coal consumed was for electricity generation.^[73]
   Coal in transit in Ohio

   In terms of the production of energy from domestic sources, from 1885
   through 1951, coal was the leading source of energy in the United
   States. Crude oil and natural gas then vied for that role until 1982.
   Coal regained the position of the top domestic resource that year and
   again in 1984, and has retained it since.^[74] The US burns 1 billion
   tons of coal every year.

   Concern for climate change has led to a call for a moratorium on all
   coal consumption, unless carbon capture is utilized. Coal is the
   largest potential source of CO[2] emissions.^[75]^[76]^[77]

   Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is the cleanest currently
   operational coal-fired electricity generation technology. FutureGen is
   an experimental U.S. research project to investigate the possibility of
   sequestering IGCC CO[2] emissions underground.

Natural gas[edit]

   See also: Shale gas in the United States

   Natural gas production and consumption quadrupled between 1950 and 1970
   to 20×10[DEL: ^ :DEL] ^12 cu ft (570 km^3), but declined steadily to
   stabilize in 1986. Since then, the United States imports a rising share
   of its gas. In 2008 consumption of natural gas stood at 23.2×10[DEL: ^
   :DEL] ^12 cu ft (660 km^3), while domestic production was at
   20.6×10[DEL: ^ :DEL] ^12 cu ft (580 km^3). Approximately 3.0×10[DEL: ^
   :DEL] ^12 cu ft (85 km^3) were imported, mainly by pipelines from
   Canada, which accounted for 90% of foreign supplies, while the
   remainder is delivered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers carrying
   gas from five different countries.^[78]

   The largest gas producing states in 2007 were Texas (30%), Wyoming
   (10%), Oklahoma (9%) and New Mexico (8%), while 14% of the country's
   production came from the federal offshore lands in the Gulf of
   Mexico.^[78] Recent development in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
   drilling have increased interest for shale gas across the United States
   in recent years. Leading fields are the Barnett Shale in Texas and the
   Antrim Shale in Michigan. Natural gas reserves in the United States
   were 35% higher in 2008 than two years earlier largely due to shale gas
   discoveries.^[79]

Nuclear power[edit]

   Main article: Nuclear power in the United States

   The United States is the world's largest supplier of commercial nuclear
   power. As of 2010, the demand for nuclear power is softening in
   America, and some companies have withdrawn their applications for
   licenses to build.^[80]^[81] Ground has been broken on two new nuclear
   plants with a total of four reactors. The only reactor currently under
   construction in America, at Watts Bar, Tennessee, was begun in 1973 and
   may be completed in 2012. Of the 104 reactors now operating in the
   U.S., ground was broken on all of them in 1974 or earlier.^[80]^[81] In
   September 2010, Matthew Wald from the New York Times reported that "the
   nuclear renaissance is looking small and slow at the moment".^[82]

   In August 2011, the head of America's largest nuclear utility said that
   this was not the time to build new nuclear plants, not because of
   political opposition or the threat of cost overruns, but because of the
   low price of natural gas. John Rowe, head of Exelon, said “Shale [gas]
   is good for the country, bad for new nuclear development".^[83]

   Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, the U.S. Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission has announced it will launch a comprehensive
   safety review of the 104 nuclear power reactors across the United
   States, at the request of President Obama. The Obama administration
   "continues to support the expansion of nuclear power in the United
   States, despite the crisis in Japan".^[84] Following the Japanese
   nuclear emergency, public support for building nuclear power plants in
   the U.S. dropped to 43%, slightly lower than it was immediately after
   the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News
   poll.^[85]

   In his 2012 state-of-the-union address, Barack Obama said that America
   needs “an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every
   available source of American energy.” President Obama boasted about a
   Michigan wind turbine factory, America's healthy supplies of natural
   gas and widespread oil exploration. He urged Congress to pass tax
   incentives for energy efficiency, clean energy, and an end to
   oil-company subsidies, but made no mention of nuclear power.^[83]

   In 2013, four aging reactors in the USA were permanently closed before
   their licenses expired because of high maintenance and repair costs at
   a time when natural gas prices have fallen: San Onofre 2 and 3 in
   California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in
   Wisconsin.^[86]^[87] The state of Vermont is trying to close Vermont
   Yankee, in Vernon. New York State is seeking to close Indian Point in
   Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City.^[87] Loss of nuclear generating
   capacity is expected to be offset by the five new nuclear reactors
   currently under construction, with a proposed combined capacity of more
   than 5,000 MW.^[88]

Renewable energy[edit]

   Main article: Renewable energy in the United States
   Part of the 354 MW SEGS solar complex in northern San Bernardino
   County, California.
   The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is an 845 megawatt (MW) wind farm in the
   U.S. state of Oregon.
   The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 MW solar photovoltaic power
   plant in Boulder City, Nevada.

   Renewable energy in the United States accounted for 13.2 percent of the
   domestically produced electricity in 2012.^[89] Renewable energy
   reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011, when it
   contributed 11.7 percent of total U.S. energy production (2.245
   quadrillion BTUs of energy), surpassing energy production from nuclear
   power (2.125 quadrillion BTUs).^[90] 2011 was the first year since 1997
   that renewables exceeded nuclear in US total energy production.^[91]

   Hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable
   power in the U.S. It produced around 6.2% of the nation's total
   electricity in 2010 which was 60.2% of the total renewable power in the
   U.S.^[26] The United States is the fourth largest producer of
   hydroelectricity in the world after China, Canada and Brazil. The Grand
   Coulee Dam is the 5th largest hydroelectric power station in the world.

   U.S. wind power installed capacity now exceeds 60,000 MW and supplies
   3% of the nation's electricity.^[92]^[93] Texas is firmly established
   as the leader in wind power development, followed by Iowa and
   California.^[94] Since the U.S. pioneered the technology with Solar
   One, several solar thermal power stations have also been built. The
   largest of these solar thermal power stations is the SEGS group of
   plants in the Mojave Desert with a total generating capacity of 354 MW,
   making the system the largest solar plant of any kind in the
   world.^[95] The largest photovoltaic power plant in North America is
   the over 200 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County, Arizona.
   The Geysers in Northern California is the largest complex of geothermal
   energy production in the world.

   With 2,957 MW of installed geothermal capacity, the United States
   remains the world leader with 30% of the online capacity total. As of
   early 2009, 120 new projects are underway.^[96] When developed, these
   projects could potentially supply up to 3,979 MW of power, meeting the
   needs of about 4 million homes. At this rate of development, geothermal
   production in the United States could exceed 15,000 MW by 2025.^[97]

   The development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marks "a new
   era of energy exploration" in the United States, according to President
   Barack Obama.^[98] In a joint address to the Congress on February 24,
   2009, President Obama called for doubling renewable energy within the
   next three years.^[99] In his 2012 State of the Union address,
   President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and
   mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit
   10,000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.^[100]

   President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
   included more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for
   clean energy and associated transportation programs. This
   policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment
   in U.S. history for renewable energy, advanced transportation, and
   energy conservation initiatives. As a result of these new initiatives,
   many more utilities are expected to strengthen their clean energy
   programs.^[101] In February 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy
   launched its SunShot Initiative, a collaborative national effort to cut
   the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75% by
   2020.^[102] Reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy
   cost-competitive with other forms of electricity.^[103]

Biofuels[edit]

   Main articles: Biofuel in the United States, Food vs. fuel and
   Sustainable biofuel

   In recent years there has been an increased interest in biofuels –
   bioethanol and biodiesel – derived from common agricultural staples or
   waste. Increased domestic production of these fuels could reduce US
   expenditure on foreign oil and improve energy security if methods of
   producing and transporting the fuels do not involve heavy inputs of
   fossil fuels, as current agriculture does.

   Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10%
   ethanol, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles
   designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Portland, Oregon,
   recently became the first city in the United States to require all
   gasoline sold within city limits to contain at least 10% ethanol.^[104]
   Ford, Daimler AG, and GM are among the automobile companies that sell
   “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and
   ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By
   mid-2006, there were approximately 6 million E85-compatible vehicles on
   U.S. roads.^[105]

   The Renewable Fuels Association counts 113 U.S. ethanol distilleries in
   operation and another 78 under construction, with capacity to produce
   11.8 billion gallons within the next few years. The Energy Information
   Administration (EIA) predicts in its Annual Energy Outlook 2007 that
   ethanol consumption will reach 11.2 billion US gallons (42,000,000 m^3)
   by 2012, outstripping the 7.5 billion US gallons (28,000,000 m^3)
   required in the Renewable Fuel Standard that was enacted as part of the
   Energy Policy Act of 2005.^[106]

   Expanding ethanol fuel (and biodiesel) industries provide jobs in plant
   construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities.
   According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry
   created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household
   income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax
   revenues at the local, state, and federal levels.^[105]

   In recent years, there has been criticism about the production of
   ethanol fuel from food crops.^[107]^[108]^[109] However, second
   generation biofuels are now being produced from a much broader range of
   feedstocks including the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial
   grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus), forestry
   materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable
   waste.^[110] Produced responsibly they are sustainable energy sources
   that need not divert any land from growing food, nor damage the
   environment.^[111]^[112]

Energy efficiency[edit]

   Main article: Efficient energy use
   A spiral-type integrated compact fluorescent lamp, which has been
   popular among North American consumers since its introduction in the
   mid 1990s.^[113]
   The Tesla Roadster, first delivered in 2008, uses Li-Ion batteries to
   achieve 220 miles per charge, while also capable of going 0-60 in under
   4 seconds.

   There are many different types of energy efficiency innovations and
   these include: efficient water heaters; improved refrigerators and
   freezers; advanced building control technologies and advances in
   heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC); smart windows that adapt to
   maintain a comfortable interior environment; a steady stream of new
   building codes to reduce needless energy use, and compact fluorescent
   lights. Improvements in buildings alone, where over sixty-percent of
   all energy is used, save tens of billions of dollars per year.^[114]

   Several states, including California, New York, Rhode Island, and
   Wisconsin, have consistently deployed energy efficiency innovations.
   Their state planners officials, citizens, and industry leaders, have
   found these to be very cost-effective, often providing greater service
   at lower personal and social cost than simply adding more fossil-fuel
   based supply technologies. This is the case for several reasons. Energy
   efficient technologies often represent upgrades in service through
   superior performance (e.g. higher quality lighting, heating and cooling
   with greater controls, or improved reliability of service through
   greater ability of utilities to respond to time of peak demand). So
   these innovations can provide a better, less expensive, service.^[114]

   A wide range of energy efficient technologies have ancillary benefits
   of improved quality of life, such as advanced windows that not only
   save on heating and cooling expenses, but also make the work-place or
   home more comfortable. Another example is more efficient vehicles,
   which not only save immediately on fuel purchases, but also emit less
   pollutants, improving health and saving on medical costs to the
   individual and to society.^[114]

   In 1994, Amory Lovins developed the design concept of the Hypercar.
   This vehicle would have ultra-light construction with an aerodynamic
   body using advanced composite materials, low-drag design, and hybrid
   drive.^[115] Designers of the Hypercar claim that it would achieve a
   three- to fivefold improvement in fuel economy, equal or better
   performance, safety, amenity, and affordability, compared with today's
   cars.^[116] Lovins says the commercialisation of the Hypercar began in
   2014, with the production of the all-carbon electric BMW i-3 family and
   the 313 miles per gallon Volkswagen XL1.^[117]

Energy budget, initiatives and incentives[edit]

   Main article: List of United States Energy Acts

   An incentive resulting from US energy policy is a factor that provides
   motive for a specific course of action regarding the use of energy. In
   the U.S. most energy policy incentives take the form of financial
   incentives. Examples of these include tax breaks, tax reductions, tax
   exemptions, rebates, loans and specific funding. Throughout US history
   there have been many incentives created through U.S. energy policy.
   Most recently the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Energy Independence and
   Security Act of 2007, and Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,
   each promote various energy efficiency improvements and encourage
   development of specific energy sources. U.S. Energy policy incentives
   can serve as a strategic manner to develop certain industries that plan
   to reduce America’s dependence on foreign petroleum products and create
   jobs and industries that boost the national economy. The ability to do
   this depends upon which industries and products the government chooses
   to subsidize.

Budget[edit]

   Further information: USDOE

   The 2012 budget that President Obama submitted to Congress calls for a
   70 percent increase over the 2011 allocation for federal research and
   development activities related to renewable energy. The Office of
   Science in the Department of Energy would receive $2.0 billion for
   basic energy sciences to discover new ways to produce, store and use
   energy. Included in that amount are allocations of $457 million for
   solar energy; $341 million for biofuels and biomass R&D, including a
   new reverse auction to promote advanced biofuels; and more than
   doubling investment in geothermal energy to $102 million. The budget
   includes funding to accelerate the deployment of new models of energy
   research pioneered in the last several years, including $550 million
   for the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, a program that
   supports breakthrough ideas.^[118]

Public investment[edit]

   Public investment can enable the development of infrastructure projects
   through the use of public funds, grants, loans or other financing
   options. These funds provide a means for allocating the capital
   necessary for the development of renewable energy technologies.

Tax incentives[edit]

   Federal tax incentives can be designed to accelerate market adoption,
   create jobs, encourage investment in a public good (reduced pollution)
   or encourage investment in renewable technology research and
   development. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) reduces the federal income
   taxes of qualified tax-paying owners of renewable energy projects based
   on the electrical output (measured in kWh) of grid-connected renewable
   energy facilities. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) reduces federal
   income taxes for qualified tax-paying owners based on dollars of
   capital investment in renewable energy projects. The Advanced Energy
   Manufacturing Tax Credit (MTC) awards tax credits to new, expanded, or
   re-equipped domestic manufacturing facilities that support clean energy
   development.^[119]

Loan guarantees[edit]

   The Department of Energy’s Loan Guarantee Program, established by the
   Energy Policy Act of 2005 and enhanced by the American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act of 2009, attempts to pave the way for investor support
   of clean energy projects by providing a guarantee of financing up to
   80% of the project cost. The program is scheduled to end on September
   30, 2011, unless Congress passes further legislation.^[120]

Renewable portfolio standard[edit]

   A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is a mandate that requires
   electricity providers to supply to their customers a minimum amount of
   power from renewable sources, usually as a percentage of total energy
   use. As of June 2010, such standards have been enacted in 31 U.S.
   states and the District of Columbia.^[121] For example, Governor Jerry
   Brown signed legislation requiring California's utilities to get 33
   percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by the end
   of 2020.^[122] Congress has considered a national RPS since 1997: the
   Senate has passed legislation three times, and the House once.^[123] As
   of April 2011, both houses have not acted in unison to pass
   legislation.

Biofuel subsidies[edit]

   See also: Food vs. fuel and Energy subsidies

   In the United States biofuel subsidies have been justified on the
   following grounds: energy independence, reduction in greenhouse gas
   emissions, improvements in rural development related to biofuel plants
   and farm income support. Several economists from Iowa State University
   found “ there is no evidence to disprove that the primary objective of
   biofuel policy is to support farm income.”^[124]

Consumer subsidies[edit]

   Consumers who purchase hybrid vehicles are eligible for a tax credit
   that depends upon the type of vehicle and the difference in fuel
   economy in comparison to vehicles of similar weights. These credits
   range from several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.^[125]
   Homeowners can receive a tax credit up to $500 for energy efficient
   products like insulation, windows, doors, as well as heating and
   cooling equipment. Homeowners who install solar electric systems can
   receive a 30% tax credit and homeowners who install small wind systems
   can receive a tax credit up to $4000. Geothermal heat pumps also
   qualify for tax credits up to $2,000.^[126]

Other subsidies[edit]

   Recent energy policy incentives have provided, among other things,
   billions of dollars in tax reductions for nuclear power, fossil fuel
   production, clean coal technologies,renewable electricity production,
   and conservation and efficiency improvements.^[127]

Greenhouse gas emissions[edit]

   See also: Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States and Kyoto
   Protocol
   CO[2] emission per capita per year per country

   Although exceeded by China,^[128] the United States has historically
   been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases.^[129] Some
   states, however, are much more prolific polluters than others. The
   state of Texas produces approximately 1.5 trillion pounds of carbon
   dioxide yearly, more than every nation in the world except five (and
   the United States): China, Russia, Japan, India, and Germany.^[130]

   Despite signing the Kyoto Protocol, the United States has neither
   ratified nor withdrawn from it. In the absence of ratification it
   remains non-binding on the US.

   The Obama Administration has promised to take specific action towards
   mitigation of climate change. In addition, at state and local levels,
   there are currently a number of initiatives. As of March 11, 2007,
   mayors of 418 US cities in 50 states have endorsed the Kyoto protocol,
   after Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle started a nationwide effort to get
   cities to agree to the protocol.^[131] As of January 18, 2007, eight
   Northeastern US states are involved in the Regional Greenhouse Gas
   Initiative (RGGI),^[132] a state level emissions capping and trading
   program.

   On August 31, 2006, the California Legislature reached an agreement
   with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to reduce the state's
   greenhouse-gas emissions, which rank at 12th-largest carbon emitter in
   the world,^[133] by 25 percent by the year 2020. This resulted in the
   Global Warming Solutions Act which effectively puts California in line
   with the Kyoto limitations, but at a date later than the 2008–2012
   Kyoto commitment period.

   In the non-binding 'Washington Declaration' agreed on February 16,
   2007, the United States, together with Presidents or Prime Ministers
   from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom,
   Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa agreed in principle on
   the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. They envisage a
   global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized
   nations and developing countries, and hoped that this would be in place
   by 2009.^[134]^[135]

   Chemistry Professor Nathan Lewis at Caltech estimates that to keep
   atmospheric carbon levels below 750 ppm, a level at which serious
   climate change would occur, by the year 2050, the United States would
   need to generate twice as much energy from renewable sources as is
   generated by all power sources combined today.^[136] However, current
   research indicates that even carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of
   450 ppm would result in irreversible global climate change.^[137]

   The book, Carbon-Free and Nuclear-Free, A Roadmap for U.S. Energy
   Policy,^[138] by Arjun Makhijani, argues that in order to meet goals of
   limiting global warming to 2 °C, the world will need to reduce CO[2]
   emissions by 85% and the U.S. will need to reduce emissions by 95%,
   which can be extended to within a few percent plus or minus of carbon
   free with little additional change.^[139] The book calls for phasing
   out use of oil, natural gas, and coal which does not use carbon
   sequestration by the year 2050.^[140] Effective delivered energy is
   projected to increase from about 75 Quadrillion Btu in 2005 to about
   125 Quadrillion in 2050,^[141] but due to efficiency increases, the
   actual energy input is projected to increase from about 99 Quadrillion
   Btu in 2005 to about 103 Quadrillion in 2010 and then to decrease to
   about 77 Quadrillion in 2050.^[142] Petroleum use is projected to
   increase until 2010 and then linearly decrease to zero by 2050. The
   roadmap calls for nuclear power to decrease to zero at the same time,
   with the reduction also beginning in 2010.^[143]

   In his book Hell and High Water, author Joseph Romm calls for the rapid
   deployment of existing technologies to decrease carbon emissions. In a
   follow-up article in Nature.com in June 2008, he argues that "If we are
   to have confidence in our ability to stabilize carbon dioxide levels
   below 450 p.p.m. emissions must average less than [5 billion metric
   tons of carbon] per year over the century. This means accelerating the
   deployment of the 11 wedges so they begin to take effect in 2015 and
   are completely operational in much less time than originally modelled
   by Socolow and Pacala."^[144]

   In 2012, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory assessed the
   technical potential for renewable electricity for each of the 50
   states, and concluded that each state has technical potential for
   renewable electricity, mostly from solar power and wind power, greater
   than its current electricity consumption. The report cautions: "Note
   that as a technical potential, rather than economic or market
   potential, these estimates do not consider availability of transmission
   infrastructure, costs, reliability or time-of-dispatch, current or
   future electricity loads, or relevant policies."^[145]

Distribution[edit]

   Main articles: Electricity distribution and V2G

   Long distance electric power transmission results in energy loss,
   through electrical resistance, heat generation, electromagnetic
   induction and less-than-perfect electrical insulation.^[146] In 1995,
   these losses were estimated at 7.2%.^[147] Energy generation and
   distribution can be more efficient the closer it is to the point of
   use, if conducted in a high-efficiency generator, such as a CHP. In the
   generation and delivery of electrical power, system losses along the
   delivery chain are pronounced. Of five units of energy going into most
   large power plants, only about one unit of energy is delivered to the
   consumer in a usable form.^[148] A similar situation exists in gas
   transport, where compressor stations along pipelines use energy to keep
   the gas moving, or where gas liquefaction/cooling/regasification in the
   liquiefied natural gas supply chain uses a substantial amount of
   energy, even though the scale of the loss is not as pronounced as it is
   in electricity.

   Distributed generation is a means of reducing total and transmission
   losses.

Carbon Dioxide emissions[edit]

   Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide versus Time

   The EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, under
   the Clean Air Act, and is one of the agency's seven priorities.^[154]
   US carbon dioxide emissions (millions of metric tons of CO[2])^[155]

   1990 5,100.5 0.00%
   2005 6,107.6 19.75%
   2006 6,019.0 18.01%

   2008 5,924.3 16.15%
   2009 5,500.5 7.84%
   2010 5,706.4 11.88%

Public opinion[edit]

   The US results from the 1st Annual World Environment Review, published
   on June 5, 2007 revealed that:^[156]
     * 74% are concerned about climate change.
     * 80% think their Government should do more to tackle global warming.
     * 84% think that the US is too dependent on fossil fuels.
     * 72% think that the US is too reliant on foreign oil.
     * 79% think that the US Government should do more to increase the
       number of hybrid cars that are sold.
     * 67% think that the US Government should allow more off shore
       drilling.

   The public is also quite clear on its priorities when it comes to
   promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil,
   coal, and natural gas. When asked which of these should be the higher
   priority, the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68
   percent-to-21 percent margin.^[157] The public also predominantly
   believes that the need to cut down on energy consumption and protect
   the environment means increased energy efficiency should be mandated
   for certain products. Ninety-two percent of Americans now support such
   requirements.^[158]

   However, when energy policy and climate change are compared to other
   issues, they are rated extremely low in terms of importance. A Pew
   Research Center poll on public priorities for 2011 found that global
   warming ranked last of twenty-two possible policy priorities. The same
   survey in 2012 found similar results.^[159]

   The Gallup organization found that from 2009 through the latest poll in
   March 2013, public opinion has been nearly evenly split on whether to
   give priority to the environment or to developing energy sources such
   as oil, gas, and coal. This represents a shift from poll results from
   2001 through 2008, when clear pluralities of Americans wanted
   environmental concerns to take priority over developing fossil fuel
   resources. However, public opinion still heavily favors an emphasis on
   wind and solar energy (59 percent) over fossil fuels (31
   percent).^[160]

General legislative policy, legislation and plans[edit]

   The current head of the U.S. Department of Energy under the Obama
   administration is Dr. Ernest Moniz, who succeeded Dr. Steven Chu in May
   2013.

   As of September 2012: "The mission of the Energy Department is to
   ensure America’s security and prosperity by addressing its energy,
   environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and
   technology solutions." – DOE website^[161]
     * Catalyze the timely, material, and efficient transformation of the
       nation’s energy system and secure U.S. leadership in clean energy
       technologies.
     * Maintain a vibrant U.S. effort in science and engineering as a
       cornerstone of our economic prosperity with clear leadership in
       strategic areas.
     * Enhance nuclear security through defense, nonproliferation, and
       environmental efforts.
     * Establish an operational and adaptable framework that combines the
       best wisdom of all Department stakeholders to maximize mission
       success.

   In December 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
   announced the Green Patent Pilot Program.^[162] The program was
   initiated to accelerate the examination of patent applications relating
   to certain green technologies, including the energy sector.^[163] The
   pilot program was initially designed to accommodate 3,000 applications
   related to certain green technology categories, and the program was
   originally set to expire on December 8, 2010. In May, 2010, the USPTO
   announced that it would expand the pilot program.^[164]
