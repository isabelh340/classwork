   Income inequality in the United States has grown significantly since
   the early 1970s,^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] after several decades of
   stability,^[7]^[8]^[9] and has been the subject of study of many
   scholars and institutions. The U.S. consistently exhibits higher rates
   of income inequality than most developed nations due to the nation's
   enhanced support of free market capitalism.^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13] Income
   inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) is not uniform among
   the states: after-tax income inequality in 2009 was greatest in Texas
   and lowest in Maine.^[14]

   Half of the U.S. population lives in poverty or is low-income,
   according to U.S. Census data.^[15] On the other hand, some members of
   the U. S. population have earned a considerable income: the top earner
   in 2011, hedge fund manager John Paulson, earned "$4.9 billion",
   according to Business Insider.^[16]^[improper synthesis?] Most of the
   growth has been between the middle class and top earners, with the
   disparity widening the further one goes up in the income
   distribution.^[17] A 2011 study by the CBO^[18] found that the top
   earning 1 percent of households increased their income by about 275%
   after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and
   2007, compared to a gain of just under 40% for the 60 percent in the
   middle of America's income distribution.^[18] Other sources find that
   the trend has continued since then.^[19] In spite of this data, only
   42% of Americans think inequality has increased in the past ten
   years.^[20] In 2012, the gap between the richest 1 percent and the
   remaining 99 percent was the widest it's been since the 1920s.^[21]
   Incomes of the wealthiest 1 percent rose nearly 20%, whereas the income
   of the remaining 99 percent rose 1% in comparison.^[21] The
   distribution of household incomes has become more unequal during the
   post-2008 economic recovery, a first for the US but in line with the
   trend over the last ten economic recoveries since 1949.^[22]^[23]
   Income inequality has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3
   metropolitan areas.^[24]

   Scholars and others differ as to the causes, and the significance of
   the trend.^[25] Education and increased demand for skilled labor are
   often cited as causes,^[26] some have emphasized the importance of
   public policy; others believe the cause(s) of inequality's rise are not
   well understood.^[18] Inequality has been described both as irrelevant
   in the face of economic opportunity (or social mobility) in America,
   and as a cause of the decline in that opportunity.^[27]^[28]^[29]
   Although some have spoken out in favor of inequality, including NYU Law
   School Professor and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago,
   Richard Epstein, (who said "if, in fact, it turns out that inequality
   creates an incentive for people to produce and to create wealth, it’s a
   wonderful force for innovation")^[30] (The notion that high levels of
   inequality drive innovation is disputed.^[31]); others have spoken out
   against inequality, including Yale Nobel prize for economics winner
   Robert J. Shiller, (who called rising economic inequality "the most
   important problem that we are facing now today"),^[32] former Federal
   Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, ("This is not the type of thing
   which a democratic society – a capitalist democratic society – can
   really accept without addressing"),^[28] and President Barack Obama
   (who referred to the widening income gap as the "defining challenge of
   our time").^[33]

History[edit]

   See also: Economic History of the United States and Great Divergence
   (inequality)
   Share of pre-tax household income received by the top 1 percent, top
   0.1 percent and top 0.01 percent, between 1917 and 2005^[34]^[35]

   The level of concentration of income in America has fluctuated
   throughout its history. Going back to the early 20th Century, when
   income statistics started to become available, there has been a "great
   economic arc" from high inequality "to relative equality and back
   again," in the words of Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman.^[36] In
   1915, an era in which the Rockefellers and Carnegies dominated American
   industry, the richest 1% of Americans earned roughly 18% of all income.
   By 2007, the top 1 percent account for 24% of all income.^[37] In
   between, their share fell below 10% for three decades. In terms of the
   nation's wealth rather than income, as of 2011 the top 1 percent
   control 40 percent.^[38]

   The first era of inequality lasted roughly from the post-civil war era
   ("the Gilded Age") to sometime around 1937. But from about 1937 to 1947
   – a period that has been dubbed the "Great Compression"^[39] – income
   inequality in America fell dramatically. Highly progressive New Deal
   taxation, the strengthening of unions, and regulation of the National
   War Labor Board during World War II raised the income of the poor and
   working class and lowered that of top earners.^[40] This "middle class
   society" of relatively low level of inequality remained fairly steady
   for about three decades ending in early 1970s,^[7]^[39]^[41] the
   product of relatively high wages for the US working class and political
   support for income leveling government policies.

   Wages remained relatively high because of lack of foreign competition
   for American manufacturing, lack of low skilled immigrant workers,^[42]
   competition for US workers in general, and – arguably most important –
   strong trade unions. By 1947 more than a third of non-farm workers were
   union members,^[43] and unions both raised average wages for their
   membership, and indirectly and to a lesser extent, raised wages for
   workers in similar occupations not represented by unions.^[44] Scholars
   believe political support for equalizing government policies was
   provided by high voter turnout from union voting drives, the support of
   the otherwise conservative South for the New Deal, and prestige that
   the massive mobilization and victory of World War II had given the
   government.^[45]

Post-1970 increase[edit]

   The income growth of the average American family closely matched that
   of economic productivity until some time in the 1970s. While it began
   to stagnate, productivity has continued to climb.^[46]

   The return to high inequality – or what Krugman and journalist Timothy
   Noah have referred as the "Great Divergence"^[37] – began in the 1970s.
   Studies have found income grew more unequal almost continuously except
   during the economic recessions in 1990–91, 2001 (Dot-com bubble), and
   2007 sub-prime bust.^[47]^[48]

   The Great Divergence differs in some ways from the pre-Depression era
   inequality. Before 1937 a larger share of top earners income came from
   capital (interest, dividends, income from rent, capital gains). Post
   1970, income of high-income taxpayers comes predominantly from "labor",
   i.e. employment compensation.^[49]

   Until 2011, the Great Divergence had not been a major political issue
   in America, though stagnation of middle class income was. In 2009 the
   Barack Obama administration White House Middle Class Working Families
   Task Force convened to focus on economic issues specifically affecting
   middle-income Americans. In 2011, the Occupy movement drew considerable
   attention to income inequality in the country.

   Breaking down the proportion of the increase in income inequality
   between 1979 and 2007 that came from distribution of pre-tax income and
   how much from taxes and "government transfers", the CBO data shows that
   the 33% increase^[50] is composed of the following:^[51]^[52]
     * 23% from changes in distribution of "market income" to households
       (top earners received a larger share of salaries, interest,
       dividends, capital gains, business income, etc.)
     * 6% from changes in "government transfers" (social security,
       unemployment, the end of AFDC welfare, etc.)
     * 4% from changes in federal taxation (overall decline in the average
       federal tax rate and shift in federal revenues from income taxes to
       less progressive payroll taxes, etc.)

   Of the 23% increase in inequality from changes in pre-tax "market
   income", 79% came from a shift to top earners in different types of
   income across the board. A smaller amount (21%) came from a shift from
   wages and salaries to more concentrated income sources – i.e.,
   interest, dividends, business income, and especially capital gains,
   which are greater among top earners than income from salaries and
   wages, which is more common to those with lower incomes.^[53]

   Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth
   Management noted that, "for the last two decades and especially in the
   current period, ... productivity soared ... [but] U.S. real average
   hourly earnings are essentially flat to down, with today's
   inflation-adjusted wage equating to about the same level as that
   attained by workers in 1970. ... So where have the benefits of
   technology-driven productivity cycle gone? Almost exclusively to
   corporations and their very top executives."^[54]

Indicators[edit]

   Inflation adjusted increase in after-tax household income between 1979
   and 2005 for the top 1% and the four of the five quintiles.^[55]

   A number of studies by the US Department of Commerce, Congressional
   Budget Office (CBO), and Internal Revenue Service, have found that the
   distribution of income in the United States – most commonly measured by
   household or individual – has become increasingly unequal since the
   1970s.

   One of the most recent and comprehensive studies on the change in
   income inequality in America was a 2011 study by the Congressional
   Budget Office (CBO) – "Trends in the Distribution of Household Income
   Between 1979 and 2007". (It chose those two years because they both
   preceded an economic recession and so both were periods of "similar
   overall economic activity"^[56]). The report found that real household
   income after federal taxes and including government transfers (payments
   from Social Security, unemployment insurance, etc.^[57]^[58]) grew by
   62%.

   However, income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by
   275%, compared to 65% for the next 19 percent, just under 40% for the
   next 60 percent, 18% for the bottom fifth of households. "As a result
   of that uneven income growth," the report noted, "the share of total
   after-tax income received by the 1 percent of the population in
   households with the highest income more than doubled between 1979 and
   2007, whereas the share received by low- and middle-income households
   declined … The share of income received by the top 1 percent grew from
   about 8% in 1979 to over 17% in 2007. The share received by the other
   19 percent of households in the highest income quintile (one-fifth of
   the population as divided by income) was fairly flat over the same
   period, edging up from 35% to 36%." ^[59]

   According to CBO,^[60] the major reason for observed rise in unequal
   distribution of after-tax income was an increase in market income, that
   is household income before taxes and transfers. Market income for a
   household is a combination of labor income (such as cash wages,
   employer-paid benefits, employer-paid payroll taxes), business income
   (such as income from businesses and farms operated solely by their
   owners), capital gains (profits realized from the sale of assets, stock
   options), capital income (such as interest from deposits, dividends,
   rental income), and other income. Of these, capital gains accounted for
   80% of the increase in market income for the households in top 20%, in
   the 2000–2007 period. Even over 1991–2000 period, according to CBO,
   capital gains accounted for 45% of the market income for the top 20%
   households.

   Pioneers in the use of IRS income data to analyze income distribution
   are Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics
   showed that the share of income held by the top 1 percent was as large
   in 2005 as in 1928.^[4] Other sources that have noted the increased
   inequality included economist Janet Yellen who stated, "the growth [in
   real income] was heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top, that
   is, the top 1 percent."^[61]

   Economist Timothy Smeeding summed up the current trend:^[62]

     Americans have the highest income inequality in the rich world and
     over the past 20–30 years Americans have also experienced the
     greatest increase in income inequality among rich nations. The more
     detailed the data we can use to observe this change, the more skewed
     the change appears to be ... the majority of large gains are indeed
     at the top of the distribution.

   Various methods are used to determine income inequality and different
   sources may give different figures for gini coefficients or ratio
   different ratio of percentiles, etc.. The United States Census Bureau
   studies on inequality of household income^[63] and individual
   income^[64] show lower levels of inequality^[65] than some other
   sources (Saez and Piketty, and the CBO), but do not include data for
   the highest-income households where most of change in income
   distribution has occurred.^[25]^[66]^[67]^[68]

Most recent statistics[edit]

   Income gini coefficient map according to The World Bank (2014).^[70]
   Higher Income Gini Index for a nation in this map implies more income
   inequality among its people.

   According to the United States Census Bureau, it reported that the
   income inequality between the richest and poorest people grew to its
   widest in 2012, as the census recorded 46.2 million people living in
   poverty.^[71] According to Michael Cembalest, the chief investment
   officer of JPMorgan Chase,^[72] as of 2011, corporate "profit margins
   have reached levels not seen in decades," and "reductions in wages and
   benefits explain the majority of the net improvement. ... US labor
   compensation is now at a 50-year low relative to both company sales and
   US GDP"^[73]

   From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 earners in the U.S. saw their income
   increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%.^[74]^[dubious
   – discuss] The share of total income in America going to the top 1% of
   American households (also after federal taxes and income transfers)
   increased from 11.3% in 1979 to 20.9% in 2007.^[75] A 2013 study by
   Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez et al., notes that the rise in the share
   of total annual income received by the top 1%, which has more than
   doubled since 1976, has had a significant effect on overall income
   inequality. It states: "It is tempting to dismiss the study of this
   group as a passing political fad due to the slogans of the Occupy
   movement or as the academic equivalent of reality TV. But the
   magnitudes are truly substantial."^[76] Also in 2013, the Economic
   Policy Institute noted that even though corporate profits are at
   historic highs, the wage and benefit growth of the vast majority has
   stagnated. The fruits of overall growth have accrued disproportionately
   to the top 1%.^[77]

   During the Great Recession of 2007–2009, inequality declined, with
   total income going to the bottom 99 percent of Americans declining by
   11.6%, but falling faster (36.3%) for the top 1%.^[78]^[79]

   However, disparity in income increased again during the 2009–2010
   recovery, with the top 1% of income earners capturing 11.6% of income
   and capital gains, and the income of the other 99% remained flat,
   growing by only 0.2%.^[80]^[81] 60% of earners in the top 0.1 percent
   are executives, managers, supervisors, and financial professionals.
   More than half of them work in closely held businesses.^[82] The top 1
   percent is composed of many professions, the five most common
   professions being managers,^[83] physicians, administrators, lawyers,
   and financial specialists. Doctors are more likely than any other
   profession to be in the 1 percent.^[84]

   OECD's study in May 2013 said the richest 10 percent of society in OECD
   countries pocketed 9.5 times as much market income as the poorest 10
   percent in 2010, up from 9 times in 2007. It also stated that the
   widest gap between rich and poor was found in Chile, Mexico, Turkey and
   the United States. By contrast, Iceland, Slovenia, Norway and Denmark
   were the most egalitarian societies.^[85]

   Upward redistribution of income is responsible for about 43% of the
   projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.^[86]

   Rising income inequality has been linked to the political polarization
   in Washington DC.^[87] According to a 2013 study published in the
   Political Research Quarterly, elected officials tend to be more
   responsive to the upper income bracket and ignore lower income
   groups.^[88]

   According to The New York Times, Canadian middle class incomes are now
   higher than those in the United States as of 2014, and some European
   nations are closing the gap as their citizens have been receiving
   higher raises than their American counterparts.^[89] Bloomberg reported
   in August 2014 that only the wealthy saw pay increases since the 2008
   recession, while average American workers saw no boost in their
   paychecks.^[90]

Measurement[edit]

   Inequality can be measured before and after the effects of taxes and
   transfer payments.
     * Market income, or income before taxes & transfers: Expertise,
       productiveness and work experience, inheritance, gender, and race
       have had a strong influence on distribution of personal
       income^[91]^[92] in the United States as in other countries.
     * After taxes & transfers: Reducing the progressivity of the income
       tax system and transfers increases income inequality. CBO reported
       in 2011 that: "The equalizing effect of transfers declined over the
       1979–2007 period primarily because the distribution of transfers
       became less progressive. The equalizing effect of federal taxes
       also declined over the period, in part because the amount of
       federal taxes shrank as a share of market income and in part
       because of changes in the progressivity of the federal tax
       system."^[93]

   One 2013 study indicated that U.S. income inequality is comparable to
   other developed countries before taxes and transfers, but rated last
   (worst) among 22 developed countries after taxes and transfers. This
   means that public policy choices, rather than market factors, drive
   U.S. income inequality disparities relative to comparable wealthy
   nations.^[94]

Demographic issues[edit]

   Comparisons of income over time should adjust for changes in average
   age, family size, number of breadwinners, and other characteristics of
   a population. Measuring personal income ignores dependent children, but
   household income also has problems – a household of ten has a lower
   standard of living than one of two people, though the income of the two
   households may be the same.^[95] People’s earnings tend to rise over
   their working lifetimes, so “snapshot measures of income inequality can
   be misleading.”^[96] The inequality of a recent college graduate and a
   55-year-old at the peak of his/her career is not an issue if the
   graduate has the same career path.

   Conservative researchers and organizations have focused on the flaws of
   household income as a measure for standard of living in order to refute
   claims that income inequality is growing, becoming excessive or posing
   a problem for society.^[97] According to sociologist Dennis Gilbert,
   growing inequality can be explained in part by growing participation of
   women in the workforce. High earning households are more likely to be
   dual earner households,^[7] And according to a 2004 analysis of income
   quintile data by the Heritage Foundation, inequality becomes less when
   household income is adjusted for size of household. Aggregate share of
   income held by the upper quintile (the top earning 20 percent)
   decreases by 20.3% when figures are adjusted to reflect household
   size.^[98]

   However the Pew Research Center found household income has appeared to
   decline less than individual income in the twenty-first century because
   those who are no longer able to afford their own housing have
   increasingly been moving in with relatives, creating larger households
   with more income earners in them.^[99] The 2011 CBO study "Trends in
   the Distribution of Household Income" mentioned in this article adjusts
   for household size so that its quintiles contain an equal number of
   people, not an equal number of households.^[100] Looking at the issue
   of how frequently workers or households move into higher or lower
   quintiles as their income rises or falls over the years,^[101] the CBO
   found income distribution over a multi-year period "modestly" more
   equal than annual income.^[102] The CBO study confirms earlier
   studies.^[55]

   Overall, according to Timothy Noah, correcting for demographic factors
   (today’s population is older than it was 33 years ago, and divorce and
   single parenthood have made households smaller), you find that income
   inequality, though less extreme than shown by the standard measure, is
   also growing faster than shown by the standard measure.^[103]

Wage inequality[edit]

   According to Janet L. Yellen, former President and CEO, Federal Reserve
   Bank of San Francisco,

     ...from 1973 to 2005, real hourly wages of those in the 90th
     percentile – where most people have college or advanced degrees –
     rose by 30% or more... among this top 10 percent, the growth was
     heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top, that is, the top 1
     percent. This includes the people who earn the very highest salaries
     in the U.S. economy, like sports and entertainment stars, investment
     bankers and venture capitalists, corporate attorneys, and CEOs. In
     contrast, at the 50th percentile and below – where many people have
     at most a high school diploma – real wages rose by only 5 to 10% –
     ^[61]

   Lisa Shalett of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management found that real average
   hourly earnings in the US "are essentially flat to down, with today’s
   inflation-adjusted wage equating to about the same level as that
   attained by workers in 1970", despite the fact that "for the last two
   decades and especially in the current period", productivity has
   "soared". The benefits of productivity during this cycle had gone
   "almost exclusively to corporations and their very top
   executives."^[54]

Gini index[edit]

   Further information: Gini coefficient
   Further information: List of U.S. states by income equality

   The Gini coefficient summarizes income inequality in a single number
   and is one of the most commonly used measures of income inequality. It
   uses a scale from 0 to 1 – the higher the number the more inequality. 0
   represents perfect equality (everyone having exactly the same income),
   and 1 represents perfect inequality (one person having all income).
   (Index scores are commonly multiplied by 100 to make them easier to
   understand.^[104]) Gini index ratings can be used to compare inequality
   within (by race, gender, employment) and between countries, before and
   after taxes.^[105]^[106]^[107]^[108] Different sources will often give
   different gini values for the same country or population measured. For
   example, the Census Bureau's official Gini coefficient for the United
   States was 46.9 in 2010, up from the all-time low of 38.6 in 1968. By
   contrast, the OECD's Gini coefficient for income inequality in the
   United States is 37 (including wages and other cash transfers), which
   is still the highest in the developed world, with the lowest being
   Denmark (24.3), Norway (25.6), and Sweden (25.9).^[109]

Comparisons by state[edit]

   This Gini Index map shows regional and county level variation in
   pre-tax income inequality Gini index. The 2010 Gini index value range
   from 0.207 for Loving County (Texas) to 0.645 to East Carroll Parish
   (Louisiana).^[110]

   The household income Gini index for the United States was 0.468 in
   2009, according to the US Census Bureau,^[111] though it varied
   significantly between states. The states of Utah, Alaska and Wyoming
   have a pre-tax income inequality Gini coefficient that is 10% lower
   than the average, while Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico 10% higher.
   After including the effects of federal and state taxes, the U.S.
   Federal Reserve estimates 34 states in the USA have a Gini coefficient
   between 0.30 and 0.35, with the state of Maine the lowest.^[14] At the
   county and municipality levels, the pre-tax Gini index ranged from 0.21
   to 0.65 in 2010 across the United States, according to Census Bureau
   estimates.^[110]

   OECD estimates the pre-tax Gini index for the United States was 0.49,
   and after-tax Gini index was 0.38, in 2008–2009. The average pre-tax
   Gini index for OECD countries was 0.46, while the average after-tax
   Gini index was 0.31.^[105]

International comparisons[edit]

   The UN, CIA World Factbook,^[112] and OECD have used the Gini index to
   compare inequality between countries, and as of 2006, the United States
   had one of the highest levels of income inequality among similar
   developed or high income countries, as measured by the index.^[10]
   While inequality has increased since 1981 in two-thirds of OECD
   countries^[113]^[114] most developed countries are in the lower, more
   equal, end of the spectrum, with a Gini coefficient in the high
   twenties to mid thirties.^[115]

   The gini rating (after taxes and government income transfers^[11]) of
   the United States is sufficiently high, however, to put it among less
   developed countries. The US ranks above (more unequal than) South
   American countries such Guyana, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and roughly
   on par with Uruguay, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, according to the
   CIA.^[116]

   income equality (27th) is higher before taxes and "transfers" are
   measured,^[120] than after (31st) ^[121] – i.e., the US has less income
   redistribution by government than some other post-industrial economies.
   However some developed countries, such as the Netherlands and Greece,
   have less inequality simply because incomes are more equal than in the
   US even before taxes.^[122]

   Some have argued that inequality is higher in other countries than
   official statistics indicate because of unreported income. European
   countries have higher amounts of wealth in offshore
   holdings.^[123]^[124]^[125]^[126]

Causes[edit]

   According to the CBO and others, "the precise reasons for the [recent]
   rapid growth in income at the top are not well understood",^[49]^[116]
   but "in all likelihood," an "interaction of multiple factors" was
   involved.^[127] "Researchers have offered several potential
   rationales."^[49]^[61] Some of these rationales conflict, some
   overlap.^[128] They include:
     * the globalization hypothesis – low skilled American workers have
       been losing ground in the face of competition from low-wage workers
       in Asia and other "emerging" economies;^[129]
     * skill-biased technological change – the rapid pace of progress in
       information technology has increased the demand for the highly
       skilled and educated so that income distribution favored brains
       rather than brawn;^[129]
     * the superstar hypothesis – modern technologies of communication
       often turn competition into a tournament in which the winner is
       richly rewarded, while the runners-up get far less than in the
       past;^[129]^[130]
     * immigration of less-educated workers – relatively high levels of
       immigration of low skilled workers since 1965 may have reduced
       wages for American-born high school dropouts;^[131]
     * policy and politics – capital account liberalization,^[132] soaring
       executive compensation, stagnating middle income pay and more
       regressive taxation resulting from political decisions, not market
       forces. Decision such as not intervening to stop executive capture
       of corporate boards, the crushing of labor unions, etc. or changes
       in the governance and structure of executive compensation,^[18] and
       the failure of government policy makers to do anything about rising
       inequality.^[133]
          + This includes less progressive taxation since 1970,
            particularly the reduction in the top marginal income tax
            rates from 91% to less than 40%; and taxes on capital gains at
            lower rates than income taxes;
          + a decline in unionization of the workforce, leaving workers
            with less bargaining power in the labor market; and
          + austerity, or cuts in public spending during adverse economic
            conditions, which can reduce wages of public employees, and
            reduce financial aid to the unemployed and underemployed^[132]

   Analyzing the top three hypotheses, economist Paul Krugman found them
   to be "increasingly inadequate" as more evidence accumulated.

     Globalization can explain part of the relative decline in
     blue-collar wages, but it can't explain the 2,500 percent rise in
     C.E.O. incomes. Technology may explain why the salary premium
     associated with a college education has risen, but it's hard to
     match up with the huge increase in inequality among the
     college-educated, with little progress for many but gigantic gains
     at the top. The superstar theory works for Jay Leno, but not for the
     thousands of people who have become awesomely rich without going on
     TV.^[129]

   While immigration was found to have slightly depressed the wages of the
   least skilled and least educated American workers, it doesn't explain
   rising inequality among high school and college graduates.^[134]
   Scholars such as political scientists Jacob S. Hacker, Paul Pierson,
   Larry Bartels and Nathan Kelly, and economist Timothy Smeeding question
   the explanation of educational attainment and workplace skills point
   out that other countries with similar education levels and economies
   have not gone the way of the US, and that the concentration of income
   in the US hasn't followed a pattern of "the 29% of Americans with
   college degrees pulling away" from those who have less
   education.^[62]^[135]^[136]^[137]^[138]^[10]

Race and gender disparities[edit]

   Median personal income by gender and race in 2005.
   Further information: Male-female income disparity in the United States
   Further information: Racial wage gap in the United States

   Income levels vary by gender and race with median income levels
   considerably below the national median for females compared to men with
   certain racial demographics.^[139]

   Despite considerable progress in pursuing gender and racial equality,
   some social scientists attribute these discrepancies in income partly
   to continued discrimination.^[140]

   Among women, part of the wage gap is due to employment choices and
   preferences. Women are more likely to consider factors other than
   salary when looking for employment. On average, women are less willing
   to travel or relocate, take more hours off and work fewer hours, and
   choose college majors that lead to lower paying jobs. Women are also
   more likely to work for governments or non-profits, that pay less than
   the private sector.^[141]^[142] According to this perspective certain
   ethnic minorities and women receive fewer promotions and opportunities
   for occupation and economic advancement than others. In the case of
   women this concept is referred to as the glass ceiling keeping women
   from climbing the occupational ladder.

   In terms of race, Asian Americans are far more likely to be in the
   highest earning 5 percent than the rest of Americans.^[143] Studies
   have shown that African Americans are less likely to be hired than
   White Americans with the same qualifications.^[144] The continued
   prevalence of traditional gender roles and ethnic stereotypes may
   partially account for current levels of discrimination.^[140] In 2005,
   median income levels were highest among Asian and White males and
   lowest among females of all races, especially those identifying as
   African American or Hispanic. Despite closing gender and racial gaps,
   considerable discrepancies remain among racial and gender demographics,
   even at the same level of educational attainment.^[145] The economic
   success of Asian Americans may come from how they devote much more time
   to education than their peers. Asian Americans have significantly
   higher college graduation rates than their peers and are much more
   likely to enter high status and high income occupations.^[146]
   Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex,
   race, and ethnicity, 2009.^[147]

   Since 1953 the income gap between male and female workers has decreased
   considerably but remains relatively large.^[148] Women currently earn
   significantly more Associate's, Bachelor's, and Master's degrees than
   men and almost as many Doctorates.^[149] Women are projected to have
   passed men in Doctorates earned in 2006–2007, and to earn nearly two
   thirds of Associate's, Bachelor's, and Master's degrees by 2016.^[150]
   Despite this, some^[who?] still argue that male workers still hold
   higher educational attainment, as the success of women in academia is a
   relatively new phenomenon.^[91]
   Household income levels and gains for different percentiles in 2003
   dollars.^[151]

   Though it is important to note that income inequality between sexes
   remained stark at all levels of educational attainment.^[139] Between
   1953 and 2005 median earnings as well as educational attainment
   increased, at a far greater pace for women than for men. Median income
   for female earners male earners increased 157.2% versus 36.2% for men,
   over four times as fast. Today the median male worker earns roughly
   68.4% more than their female counterparts, compared to 176.3% in 1953.
   The median income of men in 2005 was 2% higher than in 1973 compared to
   a 74.6% increase for female earners.^[148]

   Racial differences remained stark as well, with the highest earning
   sex-gender demographic of workers aged 25 or older, Asian males (who
   were roughly tied with white males) earning slightly more than twice as
   much as the lowest-earning demographic, Hispanic females.^[152]^[153]
   As mentioned above, inequality between races and gender persisted at
   similar education levels.^[153]^[154] Racial differences were overall
   more pronounced among male than among female income earners. In 2009,
   Hispanics were more than twice as likely to be poor than non-Hispanic
   whites, research indicates.^[155] Lower average English ability, low
   levels of educational attainment, part-time employment, the
   youthfulness of Hispanic household heads, and the 2007–09 recession are
   important factors that have pushed up the Hispanic poverty rate
   relative to non-Hispanic whites. During the early 1920s, median
   earnings decreased for both sexes, not increasing substantially until
   the late 1990s. Since 1974 the median income for workers of both sexes
   increased by 31.7% from $18,474 to $24,325, reaching its high-point in
   2000.^[156]

Education[edit]

   Median personal and household income according to different education

   Main article: Educational attainment in the United States

   Income differences between the varying levels of educational attainment
   (usually measured by the highest degree of education an individual has
   completed) have increased. Expertise and skill certified through an
   academic degree translates into increased scarcity of an individual's
   occupational qualification which in turn leads to greater economic
   rewards.^[172] As the United States has developed into a
   post-industrial society more and more employers require expertise that
   they did not a generation ago, while the manufacturing sector which
   employed many of those lacking a post-secondary education is decreasing
   in size.^[173]

   In the resulting economic job market the income discrepancy between the
   working class and the professional with the higher academic
   degrees,^[91] who possess scarce amounts of certified expertise, may be
   growing.

   Households in the upper quintiles are generally home to more, better
   educated and employed working income earners, than those in lower
   quintiles.^[98] Among those in the upper quintile, 62% of householders
   were college graduates, 80% worked full-time and 76% of households had
   two or more income earners, compared to the national percentages of
   27%, 58% and 42%, respectively.^[91]^[92]^[174] Upper-most sphere US
   Census Bureau data indicated that occupational achievement and the
   possession of scarce skills correlates with higher income.^[174]

     Average earnings in 2002 for the population 18 years and over were
     higher at each progressively higher level of education... This
     relationship holds true not only for the entire population but also
     across most subgroups. Within each specific educational level,
     earnings differed by sex and race. This variation may result from a
     variety of factors, such as occupation, working full- or part-time,
     age, or labor force experience. – ^[91]^[175]

   Two researchers have suggested that children in low income families are
   exposed to 636 words an hour, as opposed to 2,153 words in high income
   families during the first four formative years of a child's
   development. This, in turn, led to low achievement in later schooling
   due to the inability of the low income group to verbalize
   concepts.^[176]

   A psychologist has stated that society stigmatizes poverty. Conversely,
   poor people tend to believe that the wealthy have been lucky or have
   earned their money through illegal means. She believes that both
   attitudes need to be discarded if the nation is to make headway in
   addressing the issue of inequality. She suggests that college not be a
   litmus test of success; that valorizing of one profession as more
   important than another is a problem.^[177]

Skill-biased technological change[edit]

   As of the mid- to late- decade of the 2000s, the most common
   explanation for income inequality in America was "skill-biased
   technological change" (SBTC) ^[178] – "a shift in the production
   technology that favors skilled over unskilled labor by increasing its
   relative productivity and, therefore, its relative demand".^[179] For
   example, one scholarly colloquium on the subject that included many
   prominent labor economists estimated that technological change was
   responsible for over 40% of the increase in inequality. Other factors
   like international trade, decline in real minimum wage, decline in
   unionization and rising immigration, were each responsible for 10–15%
   of the increase.^[180]^[181]

   Numbers show the strength of education's influence on income
   distribution.^[182] In 2005, roughly 55% of income earners with
   doctorate degrees – the most educated 1.4% – were among the top 15
   percent earners. Among those with Masters degrees – the most educated
   10% – roughly half had incomes among the top 20 percent of
   earners.^[170] Only among households in the top quintile were
   householders with college degrees in the majority.^[92]

   But while the higher education commonly translates into higher
   income,^[182] and the highly educated are disproportionately
   represented in upper quintile households, differences in educational
   attainment fail to explain income discrepancies between the top 1
   percent and the rest of the population. Large percentages of
   individuals lacking a college degree are present in all income
   demographics, including 33% of those with heading households with six
   figure incomes.^[92] From 2000 to 2010, the 1.5% of Americans with an
   M.D., J.D., or M.B.A. and the 1.5% with a PhD saw median income gains
   of approximately 5%. Among those with a college or master’s degree
   (about 25% of the American workforce) average wages dropped by about
   7%, (though this was less than the decline in wages for those who had
   not completed college).^[183] Post-2000 data has provided "little
   evidence" for SBTC’s role in increasing inequality. The wage premium
   for college educated has risen little and there has been little shift
   in shares of employment to more highly skilled occupations.^[184]

   Approaching the issue from occupations that have been replaced or
   downgraded since the late 1970s, one scholar found that jobs that
   "require some thinking but not a lot" – or moderately skilled
   middle-class occupations such as cashiers, typists, welders, farmers,
   appliance repairmen – declined the furthest in wage rates and/or
   numbers. Employment requiring either more skill or less has been less
   affected.^[185] However the timing of the great technological change of
   the era – internet use by business starting in the late 1990s – does
   not match that of the growth of income inequality (starting in the
   early 1970s but slackening somewhat in the 1990s). Nor does the
   introduction of technologies that increase the demand for more skilled
   workers seem to be generally associated with a divergence in household
   income among the population. Inventions of the 20th century such as AC
   electric power, the automobile, airplane, radio, television, the
   washing machine, Xerox machine, each had an economic impact similar to
   computers, microprocessors and internet, but did not coincide with
   greater inequality.^[185]

Relative to technological development rate[edit]

   Another explanation is that the combination of the introduction of
   technologies that increase the demand for skilled workers, and the
   failure of the American education system to provide a sufficient
   increase in those skilled workers has bid up those workers' salaries.
   An example of the slowdown in education growth in America (that began
   about the same time as the Great Divergence began) is the fact that the
   average person born in 1945 received two more years of schooling than
   his parents, while the average person born in 1975 received only half a
   year more of schooling.^[186] Author Timothy Noah's
   "back-of-the-envelope" estimation based on "composite of my discussions
   with and reading of the various economists and political scientists" is
   that the "various failures" in America's education system are
   "responsible for 30%" of the post-1978 increase in inequality.^[186]

Incentives[edit]

   Percent of households with 2+ income earners, and full-time workers by
   income.^[174]

   In the context of concern over income inequality, a number of
   economists, such as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, have talked
   about the importance of incentives: "... without the possibility of
   unequal outcomes tied to differences in effort and skill, the economic
   incentive for productive behavior would be eliminated, and our
   market-based economy ... would function far less
   effectively."^[172]^[187]

   Since abundant supply decreases market value, the possession of scarce
   skills considerably increases income.^[91] Among the American lower
   class, the most common source of income was not occupation, but
   government welfare.^[188]

Taxation[edit]

   Main article: Tax policy and economic inequality in the United States

   Another factor in income inequality/equality is the effective rate at
   which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system.
   A progressive tax is a tax in which the effective tax rate increases as
   the taxable base amount increases.^[189]^[190]^[191]^[192]^[193]
   Overall income tax rates in the U.S. are below the OECD average, and
   until 2005 have been declining.^[194]

   How much tax policy change over the last thirty years has contributed
   to income inequality is disputed. In their comprehensive 2011 study of
   income inequality (Trends in the Distribution of Household Income
   Between 1979 and 2007),^[51] the CBO found that,

     The top fifth of the population saw a 10-percentage-point increase
     in their share of after-tax income. Most of that growth went to the
     top 1 percent of the population. All other groups saw their shares
     decline by 2 to 3 percentage points. In 2007, federal taxes and
     transfers reduced the dispersion of income by 20 percent, but that
     equalizing effect was larger in 1979. The share of transfer payments
     to the lowest-income households declined. The overall average
     federal tax rate fell.

   However, a more recent CBO analysis indicates that with changes to 2013
   tax law, the effective federal tax rates for the highest earning
   household will increase to levels not seen since 1979.^[195]

   According to journalist Timothy Noah, "you can't really demonstrate
   that U.S. tax policy had a large impact on the three-decade income
   inequality trend one way or the other. The inequality trend for pre-tax
   income during this period was much more dramatic."^[196] Noah estimates
   tax changes account for 5% of the Great Divergence.^[186]

   But many – such as economist Paul Krugman – emphasize the effect of
   changes in taxation – such as the 2001 and 2003 Bush administration tax
   cuts which cut taxes far more for high-income households than those
   below – on increased income inequality.^[197]

   Part of the growth of income inequality under Republican
   administrations (described by Larry Bartels) has been attributed to tax
   policy. A study by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that "large
   reductions in tax progressivity since the 1960s took place primarily
   during two periods: the Reagan presidency in the 1980s and the Bush
   administration in the early 2000s."^[198]
   Based on CBO Estimates,^[195] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be
   paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income
   groups will remain at historic lows.^[199]

   During Republican President Ronald Reagan's tenure in office the top
   marginal income tax rate was reduced from over 70 to 28 percent, high
   top marginal rates like 70% being the sort in place during much of the
   period of great income equality following the "Great
   Compression".^[196] The lowest marginal rate for the bottom fell from
   14 to 11 percent.^[200] However the effective rate on top earners
   before Reagan's tax cut was much lower because of loopholes and
   charitable contributions.^[201]^[202] President Ronald Reagan's 1981
   cut in the top rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital
   gains rate to only 20% – its lowest level since the Hoover
   administration. The net result being an increase in growth in the U.S.
   economy, rising from 3.1 percent to 3.5 percent.^[203]^[204]

   In 1997, Democrat President Bill Clinton reduced the capital gains tax
   rate from 28 percent to 20 percent as part of an effort to stimulate
   free market investment. This action, like Reagan's capital gains cut,
   is correlated with a substantial boom in the U.S. economy, again
   increasing annual growth from 3.1 to 4.5 percent.^[205]^[206]During the
   Republican administration under George W. Bush, the tax rate on capital
   gains and qualifying dividends – a disproportionate source of income
   for top earners – fell to 15%, less than half the 35% top rate on
   ordinary income.^[207] Rising inequality has also been attributed to
   President Bush's veto of tax harmonization, as this would have
   prohibited offshore tax havens.^[208]

   One study^[209] found reductions of total effective tax rates were most
   significant for individuals with highest incomes. (see "Federal Tax
   Rate by Income Group" chart) For those with incomes in the top 0.01
   percent, overall rates of Federal tax fell from 74.6% in 1970, to 34.7%
   in 2004 (the reversal of the trend in 2000 with a rise to 40.8% came
   after the 1993 Clinton deficit reduction tax bill), the next 0.09
   percent falling from 59.1% to 34.1%, before leveling off with a
   relatively modest drop of 41.4 to 33.0% for the 99.5–99.9 percent
   group. Although the tax rate for low-income earners fell as well
   (though not as much), these tax reductions compare with virtually no
   change – 23.3% tax rate in 1970, 23.4% in 2004 – for the US population
   overall.^[209]

   The study found the decline in progressivity since 1960 was due to the
   shift from allocation of corporate income taxes among labor and capital
   to the effects of the individual income tax.^[209]^[210] Paul Krugman
   also supports this claim saying, "The overall tax rate on these high
   income families fell from 36.5% in 1980 to 26.7% in 1989."^[211]

   From the White House's own analysis, the federal tax burden for those
   making greater than $250,000 fell considerably during the late 1980s,
   1990s and 2000s, from an effective tax of 35% in 1980, down to under
   30% from the late 1980s to 2011.^[212]

   Many studies argue that tax changes of S corporations confound the
   statistics prior to 1990. However, even after these changes
   inflation-adjusted average after-tax income grew by 25% between 1996
   and 2006 (the last year for which individual income tax data is
   publicly available). This average increase, however, obscures a great
   deal of variation. The poorest 20% of tax filers experienced a 6%
   reduction in income while the top 0.1 percent of tax filers saw their
   income almost double. Tax filers in the middle of the income
   distribution experienced about a 10% increase in income. Also during
   this period, the proportion of income from capital increased for the
   top 0.1 percent from 64% to 70%.^[213]

Taxes and transfer payments[edit]

   CBO reported in 2011 that less progressive tax and transfer policies
   have contributed to greater after-tax income inequality: "As a result
   of the diminishing effect of transfers and federal taxes, the Gini
   index for income after transfers and federal taxes grew by more than
   the index for market income. Between 1979 and 2007, the Gini index for
   market income increased by 23 percent, the index for market income
   after transfers increased by 29 percent, and the index for income
   measured after transfers and federal taxes increased by 33
   percent."^[93]

Globalization[edit]

   While economists who have studied globalization agree imports have had
   an effect, the timing of import growth does not match the growth of
   income inequality. China is the world's biggest exporter and maker of
   manufactured products but had a per capita income in 2007 one-seventh
   that of the United States. By 1995 imports of manufactured goods from
   low-wage countries totaled less than 3% of US gross domestic
   product.^[214]

   It wasn't until 2006 that the US imported more manufactured goods from
   low-wage (developing) countries than from high-wage (advanced)
   economies.^[215] Inequality increased during the 2000–2010 decade not
   because of stagnating wages for less-skilled workers, but because of
   accelerating incomes of the top 0.1%.^[214] Author Timothy Noah
   estimates that "trade", increases in imports are responsible for just
   10% of the "Great Divergence" in income distribution.^[186]

   Journalist James Surowiecki notes that in the last 50 years, companies
   and the sectors of the economy providing the most employment in the US
   – major retailers, restaurant chains, and supermarkets – are ones with
   lower profit margins and less pricing power than in the 1960s; while
   sectors with high profit margins and average salaries – like high
   technology – have relatively few employees.^[216]

   Some economists claim that is it WTO-led globalization and competition
   from developing countries, especially China, that has resulted in the
   recent decline in labor’s share of income and increased unemployment in
   the U.S.^[217] And the Economic Policy Institute and the Center for
   Economic and Policy Research argue that some trade agreements such as
   the Trans-Pacific Partnership could result in further job losses and
   declining wages.^[218]^[219]

Immigration[edit]

   The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 increased immigration to
   America, especially of non-Europeans.^[116] From 1970 to 2007, the
   foreign-born proportion of America's population grew from 5% to 11%,
   most of whom had lower education levels and incomes than native-born
   Americans. But the contribution of this increase in supply of low-skill
   labor seem to have been relatively modest. One estimate stated that
   immigration reduced the average annual income of native-born
   "high-school dropouts" ("who roughly correspond to the poorest tenth of
   the workforce") by 7.4% from 1980 to 2000. The decline in income of
   better educated workers was much less.^[116] Author Timothy Noah
   estimates that "immigration" is responsible for just 5% of the "Great
   Divergence" in income distribution.^[186]

Changes in income calculation[edit]

   One observer who denies that household income has become more unequal
   is Alan Reynolds, senior fellow with the Cato Institute. Reynolds has
   declared that income inequality is a statistical illusion brought about
   by technical changes in the tax law that alter what income gets
   reported to the Internal Revenue Service and what income does
   not.^[97]^[220] This claim has been criticized as "a mountain of
   hard-to-follow, often irrelevant, and sometimes entirely erroneous
   statistical quibbles"^[221] or "intellectual three-card monte."^[222]

   Reynolds points out that all the data gathered to calculate income
   inequality is based on federal tax returns. Income that is not on tax
   returns is not included in the data. Not surprisingly, what income is
   required and not required to be reported has changed. Prior to the
   1980s, interest in municipal bonds and executive stock options did not
   need to be reported as taxable income.^[223] In addition, many
   corporations filed as C-Corporations and therefore their income did not
   show up on individual tax returns. After the 1986 tax reform
   legislation and tax cuts under President Reagan, many corporations
   switched to being S-Corporations and therefore paid the personal income
   tax rate rather than the corporate tax rate.^[224] As a result of these
   and other changes, during and after the 1980s lots of new income began
   to show up on the tax returns of top earners that had really been
   earned all along. For this reason it is not surprising that studies
   done by Pikkety/Saez and others show most of the increase in the top
   1%'s share of annual income occurring in the 1986–1988 period.
   Furthermore, tax-deferred accounts began to show income disappearing
   from the returns of the holders of the accounts as they appeared in the
   1980s. A 2001 Federal Reserve study showed that just 5.5% of the top
   1%'s assets were held in tax deferred accounts, while 14.5% of the
   50th–95th percentile's assets were held in tax deferred accounts.^[225]
   Transfer payments are also largely ignored by most studies, but the
   proportion of income the absorb has risen from 5.9% in 1970 to 14.2% in
   2004.^[226] These payments generally go to lower-income families and
   therefore their absence has steadily made the statistics more and more
   flawed over the years. Reynolds' argument is that the changes have
   eliminated income from the middle while adding income to the top,
   exacerbating the situation statistically but in reality changing little
   to nothing.

Executive and labor pay and institutions[edit]

   Critics of technological change as an explanation for the "Great
   Divergence" of income levels in America^[26] point to public policy and
   party politics, or "stuff the government did, or didn't do".^[196] They
   argue these have led to a trend of declining labor union membership
   rates and resulting diminishing political clout, decreased expenditure
   on social services, and less government redistribution. Moreover, the
   United States is the only advanced economy without a labor-based
   political party.^[227]

   As of 2011, several state legislatures have launched initiatives aimed
   at lowering wages, labor standards, and workplace protections for both
   union and non-union workers.^[228]

Political parties and presidents[edit]

   Liberal political scientist Larry Bartels has found a strong
   correlation between the party of the president and income inequality in
   America since 1948. (see below)^[137]^[229] Examining average annual
   pre-tax income growth from 1948 to 2005 (which encompassed most of the
   egalitarian Great Compression and the entire inegalitarian Great
   Divergence)^[230] Bartels shows that under Democratic presidents (from
   Harry Truman forward), the greatest income gains have been at the
   bottom of the income scale and tapered off as income rose. Under
   Republican presidents, in contrast, gains were much less but what
   growth there was concentrated towards the top, tapering off as you went
   down the income scale.^[52]^[231]

   Summarizing Bartels's findings, journalist Timothy Noah referred to the
   administrations of Democratic presidents as "Democrat-world", and GOP
   administrations as "Republican-world":

     In Democrat-world, pre-tax income increased 2.64% annually for the
     poor and lower-middle-class and 2.12% annually for the
     upper-middle-class and rich. There was no Great Divergence. Instead,
     the Great Compression – the egalitarian income trend that prevailed
     through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s – continued to the present,
     albeit with incomes converging less rapidly than before. In
     Republican-world, meanwhile, pre-tax income increased 0.43 percent
     annually for the poor and lower-middle-class and 1.90 percent for
     the upper-middle-class and rich. Not only did the Great Divergence
     occur; it was more greatly divergent. Also of note: In
     Democrat-world pre-tax income increased faster than in the real
     world not just for the 20th percentile but also for the 40th, 60th,
     and 80th. We were all richer and more equal! But in
     Republican-world, pre-tax income increased slower than in the real
     world not just for the 20th percentile but also for the 40th, 60th,
     and 80th. We were all poorer and less equal! Democrats also produced
     marginally faster income growth than Republicans at the 95th
     percentile, but the difference wasn't statistically
     significant.^[196]

   The pattern of distribution of growth appears to be the result of a
   whole host of policies,

     including not only the distribution of taxes and benefits but also
     the government's stance toward unions, whether the minimum wage
     rises, the extent to which the government frets about inflation
     versus too-high interest rates, etc., etc.^[52]

   Noah admits the evidence of this correlation is "circumstantial rather
   than direct", but so is "the evidence that smoking is a leading cause
   of lung cancer."^[196]

Non-party political action[edit]

   Ratio of average compensation of CEOs and production workers,
   1965–2009. Source: Economic Policy Institute. 2011. Based on data from
   Wall Street Journal/Mercer, Hay Group 2010.^[232]

   According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson writing
   in the book Winner-Take-All Politics, the important policy shifts were
   brought on not by the Republican Party but by the development of a
   modern, efficient political system, especially lobbying, by top earners
   – and particularly corporate executives and the financial services
   industry.^[233] the end of the 1970s saw a transformation of American
   politics away from a focus on the middle class, with new, much more
   effective, aggressive and well-financed lobbyists and pressure groups
   acting on behalf of upper income groups. Executives successfully
   eliminated any countervailing power or oversight of corporate managers
   (from private litigation, boards of directors and shareholders, the
   Securities and Exchange Commission or labor unions).^[234]

   The financial industry's success came from successfully pushing for
   deregulation of financial markets, allowing much more lucrative but
   much more risky investments from which it privatized the gains while
   socializing the losses with government bailouts.^[235] (the two groups
   formed about 60% of the top 0.1 percent of earners.) All top earners
   were helped by deep cuts in estate and capital gains taxes, and tax
   rates on high levels of income.

   Arguing against the proposition that the explosion in pay for corporate
   executives – which grew from 35X average worker pay in 1978 to over
   250X average pay before the 2007 recession^[236] – is driven by an
   increased demand for scarce talent and set according to performance,
   Krugman points out that multiple factors outside of executives' control
   govern corporate profitability, particularly in short term when the
   head of a company like Enron may look like a great success. Further,
   corporate boards follow other companies in setting pay even if the
   directors themselves disagree with lavish pay "partly to attract
   executives whom they consider adequate, partly because the financial
   market will be suspicious of a company whose CEO isn't lavishly paid."
   Finally "corporate boards, largely selected by the CEO, hire
   compensation experts, almost always chosen by the CEO" who naturally
   want to please their employers.^[237]

   Lucian Arye Bebchuk, Jesse M. Fried, the authors of Pay Without
   Performance, critique of executive pay, argue that executive capture of
   corporate governance is so complete that only public relations, i.e.
   public `outrage`, constrains their pay.^[238] This in turn has been
   reduced as traditional critics of excessive pay – such as politicians
   (where need for campaign contributions from the richest outweighs
   populist indignation), media (lauding business genius), unions
   (crushed) – are now silent.^[239]

   In addition to politics, Krugman postulated change in norms of
   corporate culture have played a factor. In the 1950s and 60s, corporate
   executives had (or could develop) the ability to pay themselves very
   high compensation through control of corporate boards of directors,
   they restrained themselves. But by the end of the 1990s, the average
   real annual compensation of the top 100 C.E.O.'s skyrocketed from $1.3
   million – 39 times the pay of an average worker – to $37.5 million,
   more than 1,000 times the pay of ordinary workers from 1982 to
   2002.^[129] Journalist George Packer also sees the dramatic increase in
   inequality in America as a product of the change in attitude of the
   American elite, which (in his view) has been transitioning itself from
   pillars of society to a special interest group.^[240] Author Timothy
   Noah estimates that what he calls "Wall Street and corporate boards'
   pampering" of the highest earning 0.1% is "responsible for 30%" of the
   post-1978 increase in inequality.^[186]

Decline of unions[edit]

   Union membership in the United States from the Great Depression to
   current day. (Source: Union Membership Trends in the United States,
   Table A-1 Appendix A for 1930 to 2000; Bureau of Labor Statistics for
   2005 and 2010.)

   The era of inequality growth has coincided with a dramatic decline in
   labor union membership from 20% of the labor force in 1983 to about 12%
   in 2007.^[241] Economists have traditionally thought that since the
   chief purpose of a union is to maximize the income of its members, a
   strong but not all-encompassing union movement led to increased income
   inequality. Given the increase in income inequality of the past few
   decades, either the sign of the effect must be reversed, the magnitude
   of the effect small, or a much larger opposing force overridden it,
   since unionization has decreased in that period.^[242]^[243]

   However more recently research has shown that unions' ability to reduce
   income disparities among members outweighed other factors and its net
   effect has been to reduce national income inequality.^[243]^[244] The
   decline of unions has hurt this leveling effect among men, and one
   economist (Berkeley economist David Card) estimating about 15–20% of
   the "Great Divergence" among that gender is the result of declining
   unionization.^[243]^[245]

   Still other researchers think it is the labor movement's loss of
   national political power to promote equalizing "government intervention
   and changes in private sector behavior" has had the greatest impact on
   inequality in the US.^[243]^[246] Timothy Noah estimates the "decline"
   of labor union power "responsible for 20%" of the Great
   Divergence.^[186] While the decline of union power in the US has been a
   factor in declining middle class incomes,^[247] they have retained
   their clout in Western Europe.^[248]

Effects[edit]

   Among economists and related experts, most agree that America's growing
   income inequality is "deeply worrying",^[28] unjust,^[129] a danger to
   democracy/social stability,^[249]^[250]^[251] or a sign of national
   decline.^[240] Yale professor Robert Shiller, who was among three
   Americans who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2013, said after
   receiving the award, "The most important problem that we are facing now
   today, I think, is rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere
   in the world."^[252] Economist Thomas Piketty, who has spent nearly 20
   years studying inequality primarily in the US, warns that “The
   egalitarian pioneer ideal has faded into oblivion, and the New World
   may be on the verge of becoming the Old Europe of the twenty-first
   century’s globalized economy.”^[253]

   Inequality in land and income ownership is negatively correlated with
   subsequent economic growth. A strong demand for redistribution will
   occur in societies where a large section of the population does not
   have access to the productive resources of the economy. Rational voters
   must internalize such issues.^[254] High unemployment rates have a
   significant negative effect when interacting with increases in
   inequality. Increasing inequality harms growth in countries with high
   levels of urbanization. High and persistent unemployment also has a
   negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment
   may seriously harm growth because it is a waste of resources, because
   it generates redistributive pressures and distortions, because it
   depreciates existing human capital and deters its accumulation, because
   it drives people to poverty, because it results in liquidity
   constraints that limit labor mobility, and because it erodes individual
   self-esteem and promotes social dislocation, unrest and conflict.
   Policies to control unemployment and reduce its inequality-associated
   effects can strengthen long-run growth.^[255]

   Concern extends even to such supporters (or former supporters) of
   laissez-faire economics and private sector financiers. Former Federal
   Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, has stated reference to growing
   inequality: "This is not the type of thing which a democratic society –
   a capitalist democratic society – can really accept without
   addressing."^[28] Some economists (David Moss, Paul Krugman, Raghuram
   Rajan) believe the "Great Divergence" may be connected to the financial
   crisis of 2008.^[256]^[257] Money manager William H. Gross, managing
   director of PIMCO, criticized the shift in distribution of income from
   labor to capital that underlies some of the growth in inequality as
   unsustainable, saying:

     Even conservatives must acknowledge that return on capital
     investment, and the liquid stocks and bonds that mimic it, are
     ultimately dependent on returns to labor in the form of jobs and
     real wage gains. If Main Street is unemployed and undercompensated,
     capital can only travel so far down Prosperity Road.

   He concluded: "Investors/policymakers of the world wake up – you’re
   killing the proletariat goose that lays your golden eggs."^[258]^[259]

   On the other side of the issue are those who have claimed that the
   increase is not significant,^[260] that it doesn't matter^[251] because
   America's economic growth and/or equality of opportunity are what's
   important,^[261] that it is a global phenomenon which would be foolish
   to try to change through US domestic policy,^[262] that it "has many
   economic benefits and is the result of ... a well-functioning
   economy",^[256]^[263] and has or may become an excuse for
   "class-warfare rhetoric",^[260] and may lead to policies that "reduce
   the well-being of wealthier individuals".^[101] ^[256]

Aggregate demand, consumption and debt[edit]

   Income inequality lowers aggregate demand, leading to increasingly
   large segments of formerly middle class consumers unable to afford as
   many luxury and essential goods and services.^[264] This pushes
   production and overall employment down.^[255]

   Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not
   significant because consumption, rather than income should be the
   measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme
   than inequality of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian
   Cato Institute states that "the weight of the evidence shows that the
   run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic
   than the rise in income inequality," and consumption is more important
   than income.^[265] According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory,
   consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in
   1986.^[266]^[267] The debate is summarized in "The Hidden Prosperity of
   the Poor" by journalist Thomas B. Edsall.^[268] Other studies have not
   found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income
   inequality,^[103]^[269] and the CBO's study found consumption data not
   "adequately" capturing "consumption by high-income households" as it
   does their income, though it did agree that household consumption
   numbers show more equal distribution than household income.^[270]

   Others dispute the importance of consumption over income, pointing out
   that if middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn it is
   because they are saving less or going deeper into debt.^[256] A
   "growing body of work" suggests that income inequality has been the
   driving factor in the growing household debt,^[103]^[271] as high
   earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go
   deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class
   lifestyle.^[272] Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their
   debt fall from 80 cents for every dollar of income to 65 cents, while
   the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents for every
   dollar of income to $1.40.^[103] Economist Krugman has found a strong
   correlation between inequality and household debt in America over the
   last hundred years.^[273]

   Deep debt may lead to bankruptcy and researchers Elizabeth Warren and
   Amelia Warren Tyagi found a fivefold increase in the number of families
   filing for bankruptcy between 1980 and 2005.^[274] The bankruptcies
   came not from increased spending "on luxuries", but from an "increased
   spending on housing, largely driven by competition to get into good
   school districts." Intensifying inequality may mean a dwindling number
   of ever more expensive school districts that compel middle class – or
   would-be middle class – to "buy houses they can't really afford, taking
   on more mortgage debt than they can safely handle".^[275]

   Central Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that "systematic
   economic inequalities, within the United States and around the world,
   have created deep financial 'fault lines' that have made [financial]
   crises more likely to happen than in the past" – the Financial crisis
   of 2007–08 being the most recent example.^[276] To compensate for
   stagnating and declining purchasing power, political pressure has
   developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income
   earners – particularly to buy homes – and easier credit in general to
   keep unemployment rates low. This has given the American economy a
   tendency to go "from bubble to bubble" fueled by unsustainable monetary
   stimulation.^[277]

Monopolization of labor, consolidation, and competition[edit]

   Greater income inequality can lead to monopolization of the labor
   force, resulting in fewer employers requiring fewer
   workers.^[264]^[278] Remaining employers can consolidate and take
   advantage of the relative lack of competition, leading to less consumer
   choice, market abuses, and relatively higher prices.^[255]^[278]

Economic growth[edit]

   A 2011 study by Ostry and Berg^[279] of the factors affecting the
   duration of economic growth in developed and developing countries,
   found that income equality has a more beneficial impact on steady
   growth than trade openness, sound political institutions, or foreign
   investment.

   In response to the Occupy movement Richard A. Epstein defended
   inequality in a free market society, maintaining that "taxing the top
   one percent even more means less wealth and fewer jobs for the rest of
   us." According to Epstein, "the inequalities in wealth ... pay for
   themselves by the vast increases in wealth", while "forced transfers of
   wealth through taxation ... will destroy the pools of wealth that are
   needed to generate new ventures.^[280] Some researchers have found a
   connection between lowering high marginal tax rates on high income
   earners (high marginal tax rates on high income being a common measure
   to fight ineuality), and higher rates of employment growth.^[281]^[282]

   Among economists and reports that find inequality harming economic
   growth are a December 2013 Associated Press survey of three dozen
   economists',^[283] a 2014 report by Standard and Poor's,^[284]
   economists Gar Alperovitz, Robert Reich, Joseph Stiglitz, and Branko
   Milanovic.

   A December 2013 Associated Press survey of three dozen economists found
   that the majority believe that widening income disparity is harming the
   US economy. They argue that wealthy Americans are receiving higher pay,
   but they spend less per dollar earned than middle class consumers, the
   majority of the population, whose incomes have largely stagnated.^[283]
   Economists Gar Alperovitz and Robert Reich argue that too much
   concentration of wealth prevents there being sufficient purchasing
   power to make the rest of the economy function effectively.^[285]^[286]

   A 2014 report by Standard and Poor's concluded that diverging income
   inequality has slowed the economic recovery and could contribute to
   boom-and-bust cycles in the future as more and more Americans take on
   debt in order to consume. Higher levels of income inequality increase
   political pressures, discouraging trade, investment, hiring, and social
   mobility according to the report.^[284] Joseph Stiglitz argues that
   concentration of wealth and income leads the politically powerful
   economic elite seek to protect themselves from redistributive policies
   by weakening the state, and this leads to less public investments by
   the state – roads, technology, education, etc. – that are essential for
   economic growth.^[287]^[288]

   According to economist Branko Milanovic, while traditionally economists
   thought inequality was good for growth,

     The view that income inequality harms growth – or that improved
     equality can help sustain growth – has become more widely held in
     recent years. ... The main reason for this shift is the increasing
     importance of human capital in development. When physical capital
     mattered most, savings and investments were key. Then it was
     important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a
     greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in
     physical capital. But now that human capital is scarcer than
     machines, widespread education has become the secret to
     growth.^[289]

   "Broadly accessible education" is both difficult to achieve when income
   distribution is uneven and tends to reduce "income gaps between skilled
   and unskilled labor."

   Economic sociologist Lane Kenworthy has found no correlation between
   levels of inequality and economic growth among developed countries,
   among states of the US, or in the US over the years from 1947 to
   2005.^[290] Jared Bernstein found a nuanced relation he summed up as
   follows: "In sum, I’d consider the question of the extent to which
   higher inequality lowers growth to be an open one, worthy of much
   deeper research".^[291]

Socio-economic mobility[edit]

   Further information: Socio-economic mobility in the United States

   Conservatives and libertarians such as economist Thomas Sowell, and
   Congressman Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.)^[292] argue that more important than
   the level of equality of results is America's equality of opportunity,
   especially relative to other developed countries such as western
   Europe.

Over lifetimes[edit]

   The centrist Brookings Institution said in March 2013 that income
   inequality was increasing and becoming permanent, sharply reducing
   social mobility in the US.^[29] A 2007 study (by Kopczuk, Saez and Song
   in 2007) found the top population in America "very stable" and "not
   mitigated the dramatic increase in annual earnings concentration since
   the 1970s."^[293]

   Economist Paul Krugman, attacks conservatives for resorting to
   "extraordinary series of attempts at statistical distortion". He argues
   that while in any given year, some of the people with low incomes will
   be "workers on temporary layoff, small businessmen taking writeoffs,
   farmers hit by bad weather" – the rise in their income in succeeding
   years is not the same 'mobility' as poor people rising to middle class
   or middle income rising to wealth. It's the mobility of "the guy who
   works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early
   thirties."

     Studies by the Urban Institute and the US Treasury have both found
     that about half of the families who start in either the top or the
     bottom quintile of the income distribution are still there after a
     decade, and that only 3 to 6% rise from bottom to top or fall from
     top to bottom.^[25]

   On the issue of whether most Americans do not stay put in any one
   income bracket, Krugman quotes from 2011 CBO distribution of income
   study

     Household income measured over a multi-year period is more equally
     distributed than income measured over one year, although only
     modestly so. Given the fairly substantial movement of households
     across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured
     over a number of years should be significantly more equally
     distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the
     movement of households involves changes in income that are large
     enough to push households into different income groups but not large
     enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income.
     Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing
     inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.^[18]

   In other words, "many people who have incomes greater than $1 million
   one year fall out of the category the next year – but that’s typically
   because their income fell from, say, $1.05 million to 0.95 million, not
   because they went back to being middle class."^[18]^[294]

Between generations[edit]

   Several studies have found the ability of children from poor or
   middle-class families to rise to upper income – known as "upward
   relative intergenerational mobility" – is lower in the US than in other
   developed countries^[295] – and at least two economists have found
   lower mobility linked to income inequality.^[27]^[28]
   The Great Gatsby Curve.png

   In their "Great Gatsby" curve,^[27] White House Council of Economic
   Advisers Chairman Alan B. Krueger and labor economist Miles Corak show
   a negative correlation between inequality and social mobility. The
   curve plotted "intergenerational income elasticity" – i.e. the
   likelihood that someone will inherit their parents' relative position
   of income level – and inequality for a number of countries.^[28]^[296]

   In the words of journalist Timothy Noah

     you can't really experience ever-growing income inequality without
     experiencing a decline in Horatio Alger-style upward mobility
     because (to use a frequently-employed metaphor) it's harder to climb
     a ladder when the rungs are farther apart.^[28]

   Aside from the proverbial distant rungs, the connection between income
   inequality and low mobility can be explained by the lack of access for
   un-affluent children to better (more expensive) schools and preparation
   for schools crucial to finding high-paying jobs; the lack of health
   care that may lead to obesity and diabetes and limit education and
   employment.^[295]

   Krueger estimates that "the persistence in the advantages and
   disadvantages of income passed from parents to the children" will "rise
   by about a quarter for the next generation as a result of the rise in
   inequality that the U.S. has seen in the last 25 years."^[28]

Poverty[edit]

   Further information: Poverty in the United States

   Greater income inequality can increase the poverty rate, as more income
   shifts away from lower income brackets to upper income brackets. Jared
   Bernstein wrote: "If less of the economy's market-generated growth –
   i.e., before taxes and transfers kick in – ends up in the lower reaches
   of the income scale, either there will be more poverty for any given
   level of GDP growth, or there will have to be a lot more transfers to
   offset inequality's poverty-inducing impact." The Economic Policy
   Institute estimated that greater income inequality would have added
   5.5% to the poverty rate between 1979 and 2007, other factors equal.
   Income inequality was the largest driver of the change in the poverty
   rate, with economic growth, family structure, education and race other
   important factors.^[297]^[298] An estimated 16% of Americans lived in
   poverty in 2012, versus 26% in 1967.^[299]

Impact on democracy and society[edit]

   Economists Jared Bernstein and Paul Krugman have attacked the
   concentration of income as variously "unsustainable"^[250] and
   "incompatible"^[251] with real democracy. American political scientists
   Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson quote a warning by Greek-Roman
   historian Plutarch: `An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest
   and most fatal ailment of all republics.`^[249] Some academic
   researchers have written that the US political system risks drifting
   towards a form of oligarchy, through the influence of corporations, the
   wealthy, and other special interest groups.^[300]^[301]

   Two journalists concerned about social separation in the US are
   economist Robert Frank, who notes that:

     Today's rich had formed their own virtual country .. [T]hey had
     built a self-contained world unto themselves, complete with their
     own health-care system (concierge doctors), travel network (Net
     jets, destination clubs), separate economy. .... The rich weren't
     just getting richer; they were becoming financial foreigners,
     creating their own country within a country, their own society
     within a society, and their economy within an economy. ^[302]

   and George Packer,

     Inequality hardens society into a class system ... Inequality
     divides us from one another in schools, in neighborhoods, at work,
     on airplanes, in hospitals, in what we eat, in the condition of our
     bodies, in what we think, in our children's futures, in how we die.
     Inequality makes it harder to imagine the lives of others.^[240]

   Loss of income by the middle class relative to the top-earning 1% and
   0.1% is both a cause and effect of political change, according to
   journalist Hedrick Smith. In the decade starting around 2000, business
   groups employed 30 times as many Washington lobbyists as trade unions
   and 16 times as many lobbyists as labor, consumer, and public interest
   lobbyists combined.^[303]

     From 1998 through 2010 business interests and trade groups spent
     $28.6 billion on lobbying compared with $492 million for labor,
     nearly a 60-to-1 business advantage.^[304]

   The result, according to Smith, is a political landscape dominated in
   the 1990s and 2000s by business groups, specifically "political
   insiders" – former members of Congress and government officials with an
   inside track – working for "Wall Street banks, the oil, defense, and
   pharmaceutical industries; and business trade associations." In the
   decade or so prior to the Great Divergence, middle-class-dominated
   reformist grassroots efforts – such as civil rights movement,
   environmental movement, consumer movement, labor movement – had
   considerable political impact.^[303]

   Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that hyper-inequality may explain
   political questions – such as why America's infrastructure (and other
   public investments) are deteriorating,^[305] or the country's recent
   relative lack of reluctance to engage in military conflicts such as the
   2003 invasion of Iraq. Top-earning families, wealthy enough to buy
   their own education, medical care, personal security, and parks, have
   little interest in helping pay for such things for the rest of society,
   and the political influence to make sure they don't have to. So too,
   the lack of personal or family sacrifice involved for top earners in
   the military intervention of their country – their children being few
   and far between in the relatively low-paying all-volunteer military –
   may mean more willingness by influential wealthy to see its government
   wage war.^[38]

   Concentration of resources in a smaller segment of the population may
   affect charitable giving. Contrary to the image of the wealthy being
   great benefactors of charity, researchers^[who?] have found
   higher-income groups donate less not more to charity than lower income.
   In 2011, the top 20 percent income group donated 1.3% of their income,
   the bottom 20 percent, 3.2%.^[306] Donations among the economic elite
   were more likely to go to elite colleges, universities, museums and
   arts organizations; and less likely to go to social-service
   organizations, such as the United Way, Salvation Army, or Feeding
   America.^[307]^[308]

   The relatively high rates of health and social problems (obesity,
   mental illness, homicides, teenage births, Incarceration, child
   conflict, drug use) and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy,
   educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social
   mobility, even numbers of patents issued per capita), in the US
   compared to other developed countries may be related to its high income
   inequality. Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50
   states of the US, British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate
   Pickett have found such a correlation which remains after accounting
   for ethnicity,^[309] national culture,^[310] and occupational classes
   or education levels.^[311] Their findings, based on UN Human
   Development Reports and other sources, locate the United States at the
   top of the list in regards to inequality and various social and health
   problems among developed countries.^[312] The authors argue inequality
   creates psychosocial stress and status anxiety that lead to social
   ills.^[313] A 2009 study conducted by researchers at Harvard University
   and published in the British Medical Journal attribute one in three
   deaths in the United States to high levels of inequality.^[314]
   According to The Earth Institute, life satisfaction in the US has been
   declining over the last several decades, which has been attributed to
   soaring inequality, lack of social trust and loss of faith in
   government.^[315]

   Paul Krugman argues that the much lamented long-term funding problems
   of Social Security and Medicare can be blamed in part on the growth in
   inequality as well as the usual culprits like longer life expectancies.
   The traditional source of funding for these social welfare programs –
   payroll taxes – is inadequate because it does not capture income from
   capital, and income above the payroll tax cap, which make up a larger
   and larger share of national income as inequality increases.^[316]

   Disagreeing with this focus on the top-earning 1%, and urging attention
   to the economic and social pathologies of lower-income/lower education
   Americans, is conservative^[citation needed] journalist David Brooks.
   Whereas in the 1970s, high school and college graduates had "very
   similar family structures", today, high school grads are much less
   likely to get married and be active in their communities, and much more
   likely to smoke, be obese, get divorced, or have "a child out of
   wedlock."^[317]

     The zooming wealth of the top one percent is a problem, but it’s not
     nearly as big a problem as the tens of millions of Americans who
     have dropped out of high school or college. It’s not nearly as big a
     problem as the 40 percent of children who are born out of wedlock.
     It’s not nearly as big a problem as the nation’s stagnant human
     capital, its stagnant social mobility and the disorganized social
     fabric for the bottom 50 percent.^[317]^[318]

   Contradicting most of these arguments, classical liberals such as
   Friedrich Hayek have maintained that because individuals are diverse
   and different, state intervention to redistribute income is inevitably
   arbitrary and incompatible with the concept of general rules of law,
   and that "what is called 'social' or distributive' justice is indeed
   meaningless within a spontaneous order". Those who would use the state
   to redistribute, "take freedom for granted and ignore the preconditions
   necessary for its survival." ^[319]^[320]^[320]

Public attitudes[edit]

   The growth of inequality has provoked a political protest movement –
   the Occupy movement – starting in Wall Street and spreading to 600
   communities across the United States in 2011. Its main political slogan
   – "We are the 99%" – references its dissatisfaction with the
   concentration of income in the top 1%.

   A December 2011 Gallup poll found a decline in the number of Americans
   who felt reducing the gap in income and wealth between the rich and the
   poor was extremely or very important (21 percent of Republicans, 43
   percent of independents, and 72 percent of Democrats).^[321] In 2012,
   several surveys of voters attitudes toward growing income inequality
   found the issue ranked less important than other economic issues such
   as growth and equality of opportunity, and relatively low in affecting
   voters "personally". ^[322]^[323] In 1998 a Gallup poll had found 52%
   of Americans agreeing that the gap between rich and the poor was a
   problem that needed to be fixed, while 45% regarded it as "an
   acceptable part of the economic system". In 2011, those numbers are
   reversed: Only 45% see the gap as in need of fixing, while 52% do not.
   However, there was a large difference between Democrats and
   Republicans, with 71% of Democrats calling for a fix.^[321]

   In contrast, a January 2014 poll^[324] found 61% of Republicans, 68% of
   Democrats and 67% of independents accept the notion that income
   inequality in the US has been growing over the last decade.^[325] The
   Pew Center poll also indicated that 69% of Americans supported the
   government doing "a lot" or "some" to address income inequality and
   that 73% of Americans supported raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to
   $10.10 per hour.^[326]

   Opinion surveys of what respondents thought was the right level of
   inequality have found Americans no more accepting of income inequality
   than other citizens of other nations, but more accepting of what they
   thought the level of inequality was in their country, being under the
   impression that there was less inequality than there actually
   was.^[327] Dan Ariely and Michael Norton show in a study (2011) that US
   citizens across the political spectrum significantly underestimate the
   current US wealth inequality and would prefer a more egalitarian
   distribution of wealth.^[328] Joseph Stiglitz in "The Price of
   Inequality" has argued that this sense of unfairness has led to
   distrust in government and business.^[329]

Policy responses[edit]

   This section may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints. Please
   improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or
   discuss the issue on the talk page. (May 2014)

   Public policy responses addressing causes and effects of income
   inequality include: progressive tax incidence adjustments,
   strengthening social safety net provisions such as Aid to Families with
   Dependent Children, welfare, the food stamp program, Social Security,
   Medicare, and Medicaid, increasing and reforming higher education
   subsidies, increasing infrastructure spending, and placing limits on
   and taxing rent-seeking.^[330]

Public spending and welfare state spending[edit]

   The OECD asserts that public spending is vital in reducing the ever
   expanding wealth gap.^[85] Lane Kenworthy advocates incremental reforms
   to the U.S. welfare state in the direction of the Nordic social
   democratic model, thereby increasing economic security and equal
   opportunity.^[331] Currently, the U.S. has the weakest social safety
   net of all developed nations.^[332]^[333]

   Welfare spending may entice the poor away from finding remunerative
   work and toward dependency on the state.^[334] Eliminating social
   safety nets can discourage free market entrepreneurs by increasing the
   risk of business failure from a temporary setback to financial
   ruin.^[335]^[336]

Taxes on the wealthy[edit]

   CBO reported that less progressive tax and transfer policies
   contributed to an increase in after-tax income inequality between 1979
   and 2007.^[93] This indicates that more progressive income tax policies
   (e.g., higher income taxes on the wealthy and a higher earned-income
   tax credit) would reduce after-tax income inequality.

   The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty recommend much higher
   top marginal tax rates on the wealthy, up to 50 percent, or 70 percent
   or even 90 percent.^[337] Ralph Nader, Jeffrey Sachs, the United Front
   Against Austerity, among others, call for a financial transactions tax
   (also known as the Robin Hood tax) to bolster the social safety net and
   the public sector.^[338]^[339]^[340]

   The Pew Center reported in January 2014 that 54% of Americans supported
   raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations to expand aid to the
   poor. By party, 29% of Republicans and 75% of Democrats supported this
   action.^[326]

Minimum wages[edit]

   Main article: Minimum wage in the United States

   In his 2013 State of the Union address, Barack Obama proposed raising
   the federal minimum wage. The progressive economic think tank the
   Economic Policy Institute agrees with this position, stating: "Raising
   the minimum wage would help reverse the ongoing erosion of wages that
   has contributed significantly to growing income inequality."^[341] In
   response to the fast-food worker strikes of 2013, Labor Secretary
   Thomas Perez said that it was another sign of the need to raise the
   minimum wage for all workers: "It's important to hear that voice... For
   all too many people working minimum wage jobs, the rungs on the ladder
   of opportunity are feeling further and further apart."^[342]

   The Economist wrote in December 2013: "A minimum wage, providing it is
   not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on
   jobs....America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one
   of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment
   from federal of state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none
   finds any serious damage."^[343]

   The U.S. minimum wage was last raised to $7.25 per hour in July
   2009.^[344] As of December 2013, there were 21 states with minimum
   wages above the Federal minimum, with the State of Washington the
   highest at $9.32. Ten states index their minimum wage to
   inflation.^[345]

   The Pew Center reported in January 2014 that 73% of Americans supported
   raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour. By party, 53%
   of Republicans and 90% of Democrats favored this action.^[326] Also in
   January 2014, six hundred economists sent the President and Congress a
   letter urging for a minimum wage hike to $10.10 an hour by 2016.^[346]

Maximum wage implementation[edit]

   Amalgamated Transit Union international president Lawrence J. Hanley
   has called for a maximum wage law, which "would limit the amount of
   compensation an employer could receive to a specified multiple of the
   wage earned by his or her lowest paid employees."^[347] CEO pay at the
   largest 350 U.S. companies was 20 times the average worker pay in 1965;
   58 times in 1989 and 273 times in 2012.^[348]

Subsidies and income guarantees[edit]

   Others argue for a Basic income guarantee, ranging from civil rights

Rent-seeking limits[edit]

   General limitations on and taxation of rent-seeking is popular with
   large segments of both Republicans and Democrats.^[354]

Economic democracy[edit]

   The economists Richard D. Wolff and Gar Alperovitz claim that greater
   economic equality could be achieved by extending democracy into the
   economic sphere.^[355]^[356] In an essay for Harper's Magazine,
   investigative journalist Erik Reece argues that "With the political
   right entrenched in its opposition to unions, worker-owned cooperatives
   represent a less divisive yet more radical model for returning wealth
   to the workers who earned it."^[357]
