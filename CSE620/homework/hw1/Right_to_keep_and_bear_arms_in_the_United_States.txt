   The right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right that is codified
   in the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of
   the United States of America and in the state constitutions of
   forty-four States.^[1] The text of the United States Constitutional
   amendment reads:

     A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
     state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
     infringed.^[2]^[3]

English precedent[edit]

   See also: Assize of Arms of 1181

   The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was influenced
   by the English Bill of Rights 1689, which also dealt with personal
   defence by English subjects.

   The 1689 Bill of Rights did not create a new right to have arms but
   instead rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed Catholic King James
   II, who, as far as relevant here, forced the disarming of Protestants
   while extending the right to bear arms to Catholics and Protestant
   dissenters in addition to upholding prior legislation that limited the
   ownership of arms to certain social classes. The relevant grievance
   reads:

          By causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be
          disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and
          Imployed contrary to Law.

   The remedy in the 1689 Bill of Rights reads:

          That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their
          Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.

   The English Bill of Rights established that regulating the right to
   bear arms was one of the powers of Parliament, and did not belong to
   the monarch.^[4] The 1689 Bill of Rights also restricted the right of
   the monarch to have a standing army.

   Sir William Blackstone wrote in the eighteenth century about the right
   to have arms being auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and
   self-preservation", but conceded that the right was subject to their
   suitability and allowance by law.

     "The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at
     present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable
     to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which
     is also declared by the same statute and is indeed a public
     allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of
     resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and
     laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of
     oppression."^[5]

Civilian usage meaning[edit]

   The right to keep and bear arms, which is protected under the second
   amendment,^[6] is often presented in the context of military service
   and the broader right of self defense. Whether this right pertains to
   individuals acting independently or the people acting collectively has
   been the topic of several Supreme Court decisions. The Supreme court
   has ruled in two separate cases that the 2nd amendment is an individual
   and incorporated right, "completely independent of any service in any
   militia." On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States, in
   a 5-4 decision, held that residents of the District of Columbia have an
   individual right to firearms, and specifically handguns, for
   self-defense within the home. District of Columbia v. Heller while at
   the same time reaffirming a broad but unnamed range of federal
   restrictions on firearms as being permissible. Also, the large body of
   state based law regarding the right to firearms and restrictions on
   firearms remain largely unchanged, though the Supreme Court ruled in
   the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago that the right to keep and bear arms
   applies to state governments via the due process clause of the
   fourteenth amendment, and is therefore an individual incorporated
   right.^[7]

   The people's right to have their own arms for their defense is
   described in the philosophical and political writings of Aristotle,
   Cicero, John Locke, Machiavelli, the English Whigs and others.^[8]
   Though possessing arms appears to be distinct from "bearing" them, the
   possession of arms is recognized as necessary for and a logical
   precursor to the bearing of arms.^[9] Don Kates, a civil liberties
   lawyer, cites historic English usage describing the "right to keep and
   bear their private arms."^[10]

   Likewise, Sayoko Blodgett-Ford notes a non-military usage of the phrase
   in pamphlet widely circulated by the dissenting minority dating from
   the time of the Pennsylvania ratifying convention for the U.S.
   Constitution:

     "[T]he people have a right to bear arms for the defense of
     themselves and their own state, or the United States, or the purpose
     of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people
     or any of them, unless for crimes committed..."^[11]

   In commentary written by Judge Garwood in United States v. Emerson, the
   United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded in 2001
   that:^[12]

     there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to
     describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional
     provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different
     states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or
     'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself']
     and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting
     that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to
     bearing arms in military service. See Bliss v. Commonwealth, 13 Am.
     Dec. 251, 12 Ky. 90 (Ky. 1822).^[13]

   Similarly, in a released Senate report on the Right to Keep and Bear
   Arms, Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,
   Subcommittee on the Constitution, states:

     They argue that the Second Amendment's words "right of the people"
     mean "a right of the state" — apparently overlooking the impact of
     those same words when used in the First and Fourth Amendments. The
     "right of the people" to assemble or to be free from unreasonable
     searches and seizures is not contested as an individual guarantee.
     Still they ignore consistency and claim that the right to "bear
     arms" relates only to military uses. This not only violates a
     consistent constitutional reading of "right of the people" but also
     ignores that the second amendment protects a right to "keep" arms.
     "When our ancestors forged a land "conceived in liberty", they did
     so with musket and rifle. When they reacted to attempts to dissolve
     their free institutions, and established their identity as a free
     nation, they did so as a nation of armed freemen. When they sought
     to record forever a guarantee of their rights, they devoted one full
     amendment out of ten to nothing but the protection of their right to
     keep and bear arms against governmental interference. Under my
     chairmanship the Subcommittee on the Constitution will concern
     itself with a proper recognition of, and respect for, this right
     most valued by free men."^[14]

   Likewise, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v.
   Heller (2008), No. 07-290, that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an
   individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a
   militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as
   self-defense within the home."^[15]

Military service and civilian usage meanings[edit]

   Some historians have argued that prior to and through the 18th century,
   the expression "bear arms" appeared exclusively in military contexts,
   as opposed to the use of firearms by civilians.^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19]

     "In late-eighteenth-century parlance, bearing arms was a term of art
     with an obvious military and legal connotation. ... As a review of
     the Library of Congress's data base of congressional proceedings in
     the revolutionary and early national periods reveals, the thirty
     uses of 'bear arms' and 'bearing arms' in bills, statutes, and
     debates of the Continental, Confederation, and United States'
     Congresses between 1774 and 1821 invariably occur in a context
     exclusively focused on the army or the militia."^[16]

   However, this conclusion is disputed and may be due to selection bias,
   which arises from the use of a limited selection of government
   documents that overwhelmingly refer to matters of military
   service.^[20] Commenting on this previous research, other historians
   note:

     "Searching more comprehensive collections of English language works
     published before 1820 shows that there are a number of uses
     that...have nothing to do with military service...[and] The common
     law was in agreement. Edward Christian's edition of Blackstone's
     Commentaries that appeared in 1790s described the rights of
     Englishmen (which every American colonist had been promised) in
     these terms 'everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun, if he
     does not use it for the [unlawful] destruction of game.' This right
     was separate from militia duties."^[20]

   The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term to bear arms as: "to
   serve as a soldier, do military service, fight," dating to about 1330.

   Garry Wills, author and history professor at Northwestern University,
   has written of the origin of the term bear arms:

     "By legal and other channels, the Latin "arma ferre" entered deeply
     into the European language of war. Bearing arms is such a synonym
     for waging war that Shakespeare can call a just war " 'justborne
     arms" and a civil war "self-borne arms." Even outside the special
     phrase "bear arms," much of the noun's use echoes Latin phrases: to
     be under arms (sub armis), the call to arms (ad arma), to follow
     arms (arma sequi), to take arms (arma capere), to lay down arms
     (arma pœnere). "Arms" is a profession that one brother chooses the
     way another choose law or the church. An issue undergoes the
     arbitrament of arms." ... "One does not bear arms against a
     rabbit...".^[21]

   Garry Wills also cites Greek and Latin etymology:

     "... "Bear Arms" refers to military service, which is why the plural
     is used (based on Greek 'hopla pherein' and Latin 'arma ferre') –
     one does not bear arm, or bear an arm. The word means,
     etymologically, 'equipment' (from the root ar-* in verbs like
     'ararisko', to fit out). It refers to the 'equipage' of war. Thus
     'bear arms' can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare, since
     the "profession of arms" refers to all military callings."^[22]

   Historically, the right to keep and bear arms, whether considered an
   individual or a collective or a militia right, did not originate fully
   formed in the Bill of Rights in 1791; rather, the Second Amendment was
   the codification of the six-centuries-old responsibility to keep and
   bear arms for king and country that was inherited from the English
   Colonists that settled North America, tracing its origin back to the
   Assize of Arms of 1181 that occurred during the reign of Henry II.
   Through being codified in the United States Constitution, the common
   law right was continued and guaranteed for the People, and statutory
   law enacted subsequently by Congress cannot extinguish the pre-existing
   common law right to keep and bear arms.^[23]

   The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution refers to a
   pre-existing right to keep and bear arms:

     A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
     State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
     infringed.^[24]

   The right is often presented in the United States as being an
   unenumerated, pre-existing right, such as provided for by the Ninth
   Amendment to the United States Constitution,^[23] interpreted by some
   as providing for unenumerated rights, and therefore implicitly a right
   to keep and bear arms:

     The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights shall not be
     construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

   Some have seen the Second Amendment as derivative of a common law right
   to keep and bear arms; Thomas B. McAffee & Michael J. Quinlan, writing
   in the North Carolina Law Review, March 1997, Page 781, have stated
   "... Madison did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he
   drafted the Second Amendment—the right was pre-existing at both common
   law and in the early state constitutions."^[25]

   Akhil Reed Amar similarly notes the basis of Common Law for the first
   ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, "following John Randolph
   Tucker's famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist case, Spies
   v. Illinois":

     Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as
     limitations on Federal power, yet insofar as they secure and
     recognize fundamental rights – common law rights – of the man, they
     make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the
     United States...^[26]

   Uviller and Merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved
   for the state, but rather was an individual and personal right for arms
   only to the extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to
   support the state. They also hold that a militia recognizable to the
   framers of the Constitution has ceased to exist in the United States
   resulting from deliberate Congressional legislation and also societal
   neglect; nonetheless, "Technically, all males aged seventeen to
   forty-five are members of the unorganized militia, but that status has
   no practical legal significance."^[12]^[19]

   A few academic writers published their opinions in several works:

     "From the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary
     ethic regarding arms and liberty, it seems to us overwhelmingly
     evident that the principal purpose of the Amendment was to secure a
     personal, individual entitlement to the possession and use of arms.
     We cannot, however, (as the individual rights contingent generally
     does) disregard entirely the first part of the text proclaiming a
     well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free
     state."^[27]

     "...we understand the Second Amendment as though it read: "Inasmuch
     as and so long as a well regulated Militia shall be necessary to the
     security of a free state and so long as privately held arms shall be
     essential to the maintenance thereof, the right of the people to
     keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." "..to us, the language
     of the Amendment cannot support a right to personal weaponry
     independent of the social value of a regulated organization of armed
     citizens.."^[28]

     ^[29]^[30]

Early commentary in federal courts[edit]

   See also: Firearm case law in the United States

   In the century following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the
   intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less
   interest than it does in modern times.^[31] The vast majority of
   regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons
   regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A
   notable exception to this general rule was Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. 1
   (1820), where the Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an
   aside.^[32]

Dred Scott v. Sandford[edit]

   In the Nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse
   and the courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves (prior to
   the Civil War), and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia
   and the arming of these individuals. Most famously this is seen in the
   court arguments of the 1857 court case Dred Scott v. Sandford, whether
   the slave Dred Scott could be a citizen with rights, including the
   right to bear arms. This debate about the rights of slaves and former
   slaves often included the usage of the term 'bear arms' with the
   meaning of individuals having or not having the right to possess
   firearms.

   In the Dred Scott decision, the opinion of the court stated that if
   African Americans were considered U.S. citizens, "It would give to
   persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one
   State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry arms wherever they
   went."^[33]

Early commentary in state courts[edit]

   The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is a federal
   provision. Each of the fifty states also has its own state
   constitution. Forty-four states have chosen to explicitly embody a
   right to bear arms into its state constitution.^[34] Each of the state
   constitutions, state laws, and state courts address the state-based
   right to bear arms distinctly within their respective
   jurisdictions.^[35] The degree and the nature of the protection,
   prohibition, and regulation at the state level varies from state to
   state. The District of Columbia, not being a state, falls within the
   federal jurisdiction.

   Approximately thirty-one states have explicitly chosen to include the
   right to arms for "individual right", "defense of self", "defense of
   home" or similarly worded reasons. Approximately thirteen states, as
   with the U.S. Constitution, did not choose to explicitly include
   "individual", "self" or "home" wording associated with a right to bear
   arms for their specific states.

   Approximately twenty-eight states have explicitly chosen to include the
   right to bear arms for "security of a free state", "defense of state",
   "common defense" or similarly worded reasons, as with the U.S.
   Constitution. Approximately sixteen states did not choose to include
   explicitly "free state", "defense of state" or "common defense" wording
   for their specific state. Whether the inclusion of these kinds of
   wording in state constitutions has relevance to the issue of whether
   implicit "individual" rights exist, or whether such rights (if any) are
   implicitly protected by the states' constitutions or by the U.S.
   Constitution's Second Amendment, remains a matter of dispute.

   Regarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal
   constitutional rights to bear arms, state courts have addressed the
   meaning of these specific rights in considerable detail. Two different
   models have emerged from state jurisprudence: an individual right
   (defense of self or home) and a collective (defense of the state)
   right.

Bliss[edit]

   Bliss v. Commonwealth (1822, KY)^[36] addressed the right to bear arms
   pursuant to Art. 10, Sec. 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky
   (1799):^[37] "That the right of the citizens to bear arms in defence of
   themselves and the state, shall not be questioned." This was
   interpreted to include the right to carry a concealed sword in a cane.
   This case has been described as about "a statute prohibiting the
   carrying of concealed weapons [that] was violative of the Second
   Amendment."^[38] Others, however, have seen no conflict with the Second
   Amendment by the Commonwealth of Kentucky's statute under consideration
   in Bliss since "The Kentucky law was aimed at concealed weapons. No one
   saw any conflict with the Second Amendment. As a matter of fact, most
   of the few people who considered the question at all believed
   amendments to the U.S. Constitution did not apply to state laws."^[39]

   The Kentucky High Court stated in Bliss, "But it should not be
   forgotten, that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by
   the constitution; it is the right entire and complete, as it existed at
   the adoption of the constitution; and if any portion of that right be
   impaired, immaterial how small the part may be, and immaterial the
   order of time at which it be done, it is equally forbidden by the
   constitution."^[36] The "constitution" mentioned in this quote refers
   to Kentucky's Constitution.^[14]

   The case prompted outrage in the Kentucky House, all the while
   recognizing that Section 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky
   (1799) did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms. The Bliss
   ruling, to the extent that it dealt with concealed weapons, was
   overturned by constitutional amendment with Section 26 in Kentucky's
   Third Constitution (1850) banning the future carrying of concealed
   weapons, while still asserting that the bearing of arms in defense of
   themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in the
   Commonwealth of Kentucky. This recognition, has remained to the present
   day in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Fourth Constitution enacted in
   1891, in Section 1, Article 7, that guarantees "The right to bear arms
   in defense of themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the
   General Assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying
   concealed weapons." As noted in the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second
   Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in the 1980s, vol. 10, no. 1,
   1982, p. 155, "The first state court decision resulting from the "right
   to bear arms" issue was Bliss v. Commonwealth. The court held that "the
   right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State
   must be preserved entire, ..." "This holding was unique because it
   stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and
   unqualified."^[40]^[41]

   The importance of Bliss is also seen from the defense subsequently
   given against a murder charge in Kentucky against Mattews Ward, who in
   1852 pulled out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brother's
   teacher over an accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class. Ward's
   defense team consisted of eighteen lawyers, including U.S. Senator John
   Crittenden, former Governor of Kentucky, and former United States
   Attorney General. The defense successfully defended Ward in 1854
   through an assertion that "a man has a right to carry arms; I am aware
   of nothing in the laws of God or man, prohibiting it. The Constitution
   of Kentucky and our Bill of Rights guarantee it. The Legislature once
   passed an act forbidding it, but it was decided unconstitutional, and
   overruled by our highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals." As noted by
   Cornell, "Ward's lawyers took advantage of the doctrine advanced in
   Bliss and wrapped their client's action under the banner of a
   constitutional right to bear arms. Ward was acquitted."^[42]

Aymette[edit]

   Aymette v. State, 21Tenn. 154, 156 (1840), In Aymette, the Tennessee
   Supreme Court construed the guarantee in Tennessee’s 1834 Constitution
   that ‘the free white men of this State, have a right to keep and bear
   arms for their common defense.’ Explaining that the provision was
   adopted with the same goals as the Federal Constitution’s Second
   Amendment, the court wrote: "The words ‘bear arms’ … have reference to
   their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about
   the person as part of the dress. As the object for which the right to
   keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature, to be
   exercised by the people in a body, for their common defense, so the
   arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually
   employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary
   military equipment."
     * 1. The act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which prohibits any person
       from wearing any bowie knife, or Arkansas toothpick, or other knife
       or weapon in form, shape or size resembling a bowie knife or
       Arkansas toothpick under his clothes, or concealed about his
       person, does not conflict with the 26th section of the first
       article of the bill of rights, securing to the free white citizens
       the right to keep and bear arms for their common defense.
     * 2. The arms, the right to keep and bear which is secured by the
       constitution, are such as are usually employed in civilized
       warfare, and constitute the ordinary military equipment; the
       legislature have the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing
       weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the citizens, and
       which are not usual in civilized warfare.
     * 3. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense, is a
       great political right. It respects the citizens on the one hand,
       and the rulers on the other; and although this right must be
       inviolably preserved, it does not follow that the legislature is
       prohibited from passing laws regulating the manner in which these
       arms may be employed.

Nunn[edit]

   The Georgia supreme court ruled in Nunn v. Georgia (Nunn v. State, 1
   Ga. (1 Kel.) 243 (1846)) that a state law banning handguns was an
   unconstitutional violation of the Second Amendment. This was the first
   gun control measure to be overturned on Second Amendment grounds.^[43]
   The Supreme Court in its ruling in Heller v. District of Columbia said
   "Nunn" Perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the
   Second amendment furthered the purpose announced in the prefatory
   clause.^[44]

     “The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys,
     and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description,
     and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be
     infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and
     all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and
     qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the
     security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or
     Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which
     contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers,
     trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and
     successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to
     this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated
     conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!”

Buzzard[edit]

   In State v. Buzzard (1842, Ark), the Arkansas high court adopted a
   militia-based, political interpretation, reading of the right to bear
   arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article
   of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of
   this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common
   defense",^[45] while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the
   carrying of concealed weapons. Buzzard had carried a concealed weapon
   and stood "indicted by virtue of the authority of the 13th section of
   an act of the Legislature prohibiting any person wearing a pistol,
   dirk, large knife or sword-cane concealed as a weapon, unless upon a
   journey, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment." Justice Lacy,
   in a dissenting opinion in Buzzard, summarizing the majority viewpoint
   to which he disagreed, declared:

     "That the words "a well regulated militia being necessary for the
     security of a free State", and the words "common defense" clearly
     show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Ark.
     and U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual
     right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity,
     has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then
     the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to
     keep and bear arms."^[45]

   Joel Prentiss Bishop's influential Commentaries on the Law of Statutory
   Crimes (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that
   Bishop characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine", as the orthodox view
   of the right to bear arms in American law.^[45]^[46]

   Political scientist Earl Kruschke has categorized both Bliss and
   Buzzard as being "cases illustrating the individual view."^[47]
   Professor Eugene Volokh revealed, in the California Political Review,
   that a statement in a concurring opinion in Buzzard was the only
   support for a collective right view of the right to keep and bear arms
   in the 19th century.^[48]

Salina v. Blaksley[edit]

   In 1905, the Kansas Supreme Court in Salina v. Blaksley^[49] made the
   first collective right judicial interpretation.^[50] The Kansas high
   court declared: "That the provision in question applies only to the
   right to bear arms as a member of the state militia, or some other
   military organization provided for by law, is also apparent from the
   second amendment to the federal Constitution, which says: 'A well
   regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the
   right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'"

Modern commentary[edit]

Interpretive Models[edit]

   Further information: Second Amendment to the United States Constitution
   and Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution

   Three models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the United
   States commonly exist. These three models are founded on differing
   interpretations of the Second Amendment, "A well regulated Militia,
   being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the
   people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."

   The first model, the individual-rights model, holds that a right of
   individuals is to own and possess firearms, much as the First Amendment
   protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech.^[51] This
   view was confirmed by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v.
   Heller (2008) than had previous interpretations by the Court. Prior to
   the Supreme Court's ruling in Heller there was a split among the
   federal courts, with nine of the federal circuit courts of appeal
   supporting a modified collective rights view, two of the federal
   circuits supporting an individual rights view, and one federal circuit
   court having not addressed the question.^[52]

   The second two models focus on the preamble, or "purpose" clause, of
   the Amendment — the words "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to
   the security of a free State." The second model, the collective model,
   holds that the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively
   rather than to individuals, under the belief that the right's only
   purpose is to enable states to maintain a militia. The third model, the
   modified collective model, holds that the right to keep and bear arms
   exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia, and then
   only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed.^[51]

Federal case commentary[edit]

   Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2008 wrote that the right to
   bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions
   and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld
   existing gun prohibitions and regulations.^[53]

   Nadine Strossen, former president of the American Civil Liberties
   Union, has stated that the individual rights model must yield to
   reasonable regulation.^[54] Strossen said "it is no more absolute than
   freedom of speech or any other right in the Constitution. No right is
   absolute; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it
   can satisfy Constitutional strict scrutiny and show the restriction is
   narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance."^[55]

   In October 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
   Circuit stated:

     "there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used
     to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional
     provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different
     states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or
     'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself']
     and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting
     that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to
     bearing arms in military service."^[56]^[57]

United States v. Miller[edit]

   Main article: United States v. Miller

   In United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), the Supreme Court
   rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act
   prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered Title II
   weapons:

     Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did unlawfully...transport in
     interstate commerce from...Claremore...Oklahoma to...Siloam
     Springs...Arkansas a certain firearm...a double barrel...shotgun
     having a barrel less than 18 inches in length...at the time of so
     transporting said firearm in interstate commerce...not having
     registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26,
     United States Code, ...and not having in their possession a
     stamp-affixed written order...as provided by Section 1132C..."^[58]

   In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice McReynolds, the Supreme
   Court stated "the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved
   to the States is plainly untenable."^[59] As the Court explained:

     In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or
     use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in
     length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any
     preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot
     say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear
     such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that
     this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that
     its use could contribute to the common defense.^[60]

   Gun rights advocates claim that the Court in Miller ruled that the
   Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of
   "ordinary military equipment."^[61] They also claim that the Court did
   not consider the question of whether the sawed-off shotgun in the case
   would be an applicable weapon for personal defense, instead looking
   solely at the weapon's suitability for the "common defense."^[62] Law
   professor Andrew McClurg states, "The only certainty about Miller is
   that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern
   scholars recognize this fact."^[63]

District of Columbia v. Heller[edit]

   Main article: District of Columbia v. Heller

   According to the syllabus prepared by the U.S. Supreme Court Reporter
   of Decisions,^[64] in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570
   (2008), the Supreme Court held^[64]^[65] that the Second Amendment
   protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with
   service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful
   purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2–53.^[64]^[65]

   Other legal summaries of the court's findings in this case are
   similar.^[66]^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]^[71]

McDonald v. Chicago[edit]

   Main article: McDonald v. Chicago

   On June 28, 2010, the Court in McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 3025
   (2010) held that the Second Amendment was incorporated. This means that
   the Court ruled that the Second Amendment limits State and local
   governments to the same extent that it limits the federal
   government.^[72] It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun
   prohibition. Four of the five Justices in the majority voted to do so
   by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while the
   fifth Justice, Clarence Thomas, voted to do so through the amendment's
   Privileges or Immunities Clause.^[73]

The politics of the right to keep and bear arms[edit]

   Main article: Gun politics in the United States

   Interest groups, primarily in the United States, exert political
   pressure for and against legislation limiting the right to keep and
   bear arms. This political debate in America is organized between those
   who seek stricter regulations and those who believe gun regulations
   violate the Second Amendment protection of a right to keep and bear
   arms.^[74] The largest advocacy group in this regard is the National
   Rifle Association, and its political wing, the NRA Institute for
   Legislative Action. The NRA has been described as one of the largest
   and most powerful political special interest groups in the United
   States.^[75] Several other groups including the Gun Owners of America
   and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, while
   smaller in size, are also politically active.^[76] The main gun control
   advocacy group is the Brady Campaign which has been described as
   considerably less effective than gun-rights organizations.^[77]

       151. "The right of self-preservation, including the right of
       self-defense, has been suggested to be within the protection of the
       Ninth Amendment. Thus, although some courts have refused to hold
       that the Ninth Amendment protects a right to possess firearms, laws
       which restrict the ability of law abiding citizens to possess
       firearms for the purpose of self-defense could be said to violate
       the Ninth Amendment. Another common interpretation of the Ninth
       Amendment is that it protects rights which were recognized at
       common law as being among the "fundamental rights of Englishmen."
       The common law, as described in Blackstone's Commentaries, has been
       carried into American jurisprudence. One such right protected at
       common law was the right to self-defense and the right to possess
       and carry weapons for defensive purposes. Hobbes described the
       right to self-defense as a fundamental natural right of which
       persons can not justly be deprived by any law or covenant.
       Blackstone listed self-defense and the right to carry weapons for
       self-defense as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.
       Blackstone further described the right to self-defense as "the
       primary law of nature, so it is not, nor can it be in fact, taken
       away by the law of society"

       and scrutiny by legal experts. Shortly after the decision, Attorney
       General John Ashcroft directed the adoption of the Emerson court's
       view as the policy of the Justice Department in a memo to all
       ninety-three United States Attorneys in November 2001. In contrast,
       legal critics of the "individualist view" repudiated the Emerson
       analysis on various grounds. Judge Robert M. Parker, while
       concurring in the Emerson result, labeled the majority's analysis
       as obiter dicta, irrelevant to the outcome of the case (see
       Emerson, Spitzer 2003). Moreover, the thoroughness of the Emerson
       analysis was criticized because the court's rendered opinion relied
       substantially on interpretations submitted in a "brief presented by
       one party" (Spitzer 2003).
