Mentality, intentions and perceptions of American foreign policy[edit]

American exceptionalism[edit]

   Currier and Ives Liberty2.jpg

   There is a sense in which America sometimes sees itself as
   qualitatively different from other nations and therefore cannot be
   judged by the same standards as other countries; this belief is
   sometimes termed American exceptionalism and can be traced to the
   so-called Manifest destiny. A writer in Time Magazine in 1971 described
   American exceptionalism as "an almost mystical sense that America had a
   mission to spread freedom and democracy everywhere."^[1] American
   exceptionalism has widespread implications and transcribes into
   disregard to the international norms, rules and laws in the US foreign
   policy. For example, the US refused to ratify a number of important
   international treaties such as Rome Statute of the International
   Criminal Court, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and American
   Convention on Human Rights; did not join the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban
   Convention; and routinely conducts drone attacks and cruise missile
   strikes around the globe. American exceptionalism is sometimes linked
   with hypocrisy; for example, the US keeps a huge stockpile of nuclear
   weapons while urging other nations not to get them, and justifies that
   it can make an exception to a policy of non-proliferation.^[2]

   Critics of American exceptionalism drew parallels with such historic
   doctrines as civilizing mission and white man's burden which were
   employed by Great Powers to justify their colonial
   conquests.^[3]^:267–268 When the United States didn't support an
   environmental treaty made by many nations in Kyoto or treaties made
   concerning the Geneva Convention, then many observers deemed American
   exceptionalism as counterproductive.^[4]

Allegations of imperialism[edit]

   Graffiti in Caracas, Venezuela, 2011.

   There is a growing consensus among American historians and political
   scientists that the United States during the American Century grew into
   an empire resembling in many ways Ancient Rome.^[5] Currently, there is
   a debate over implications of imperial tendencies of the US foreign
   policy on democracy and social order.^[6]^[7]

   In 2002, conservative political commentator Charles Krauthammer
   declared cultural, economical, technological and military superiority
   of the US in the world a given fact. In his opinion, people were
   "coming out of the closet on the word empire".^[8] More prominently,
   the New York Times Sunday magazine cover for January 5, 2003 featured a
   slogan "American Empire: Get Used To It." Inside, a Canadian author
   Michael Ignatieff characterized the American imperial power as an
   empire lite.^[9] According to Newsweek reporter Fareed Zakaria, the
   Washington establishment has "gotten comfortable with the exercise of
   American hegemony and treats compromise as treason and negotiations as
   appeasement", and added, "This is not foreign policy; it's imperial
   policy."^[10] Emily Eakin reflecting the intellectual trends of the
   time, summarized in the New York Times that, "America is no mere
   superpower or hegemon but a full-blown empire in the Roman and British
   sense. That, at any rate, is the consensus of some of the nation's most
   notable commentators and scholars."^[8]

   Many allies of the US were critical of a new, unilateral sensibility
   tone in its foreign policy, and showed displeasure by voting, for
   example, against the US in the United Nations in 2001.^[11]

Financial interests and foreign policy[edit]

   A famous cartoon by Joseph Keppler, 1889, depicting the role of
   corporate interests in Congress.

   Some historians, including Andrew Bacevich, suggest that the U.S.
   foreign policy is directed by "wealthy individuals and
   institutions."^[12] In 1893, a decision to back a plot to overthrow the
   president Harrison in Hawaii was clearly motivated by business
   interests; it was an effort to prevent a proposed tariff increase on
   sugar. As a result, Hawaii became a U.S. state afterward.^[13] There
   was allegation that the Spanish-American War in 1898 was motivated
   mainly by business interests in Cuba.^[13]
   Carlos Latuff's cartoon, 2002.

   During the first half of the 20th century the United States became
   engaged in a series of local conflicts in Latin America, which went
   into history as banana wars. The main purpose of these wars were to
   defend American commercial interests in the region. Later, U.S. Marine
   Corps Major General Smedley Butler famously wrote, "I spent 33 years
   and four months in active military service and during that period I
   spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for
   Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster
   for capitalism.^[14]

   Some critics assert the U.S. decision to support the separatists in
   Colombia in 1903 was motivated largely by business interests centered
   on Panama Canal despite declarations that it aimed to "spread
   democracy" and "end oppression."^[13] One can say that the U.S. foreign
   policy does reflect the will of the people, however people might have a
   consumerist mentality, which justifies wars in their minds.^[15]

   There are allegations that decisions to go to war in Iraq were
   motivated at least partially by oil interests; for example, a British
   newspaper The Independent reported that the "Bush administration is
   heavily involved in writing Iraq's oil law" which would "allow Western
   oil companies contracts to pump oil out of Iraq up to 30 years, and the
   profits would be tax-free."^[13]^[16] Whether motivated by oil or not,
   the U.S. foreign policy appears to much of the world as to have been
   motivated by oil rationale.^[17]

Manipulation of U.S. foreign policy[edit]

   Some political scientists maintained that setting economic
   interdependence as a foreign policy goal may have exposed the United
   States to manipulation. As a result, the U.S. trading partners gained
   an ability to influence the U.S. foreign policy decision-making process
   by manipulating, for example, the currency exchange rate, or
   restricting the flow of goods and raw materials. In addition, more than
   40% of the U.S. foreign debt is currently owned by the big
   institutional investors from overseas, who continue to accumulate the
   Treasury bonds .^[18]^:9–10 A Washington Post reporter wrote that
   "several less-than-democratic African leaders have skillfully played
   the anti-terrorism card to earn a relationship with the United States
   that has helped keep them in power", and suggested, in effect, that
   therefore foreign dictators could manipulate the U.S. foreign policy
   for their own benefit.^[19] It is also possible for foreign governments
   to channel money through PACs to buy influence in Congress.

Lack of vision[edit]

   The short-term election cycle coupled with the inability to stay
   focused on long term objectives motivates American presidents to lean
   towards actions that would appease the citizenry, and, as a rule, avoid
   complicated international issues and difficult choices. Thus,
   Brzezinski criticized the Clinton presidency as having a foreign policy
   which lacked "discipline and passion" and subjected the U.S. to "eight
   years of drift."^[20] In comparison, the next, Bush presidency was
   criticized for many impulsive decisions that harmed the international
   standing of the US in the world.^[21] Former director of operations for
   the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Gregory S. Newbold commented that,
   "There’s a broad naivete in the political class about America’s
   obligations in foreign policy issues, and scary simplicity about the
   effects that employing American military power can achieve".^[22]

Allegations of arrogance[edit]

   Some commentators have thought the United States became arrogant,
   particularly after its victory in World War II.^[1] Critics such as
   Andrew Bacevich call on America to have a foreign policy "rooted in
   humility and realism."^[16] Foreign policy experts such as Zbigniew
   Brzezinski counsel a policy of self-restraint and not pressing every
   advantage, and listening to other nations.^[20] A government official
   called the US policy in Iraq "arrogant and stupid," according to one
   report.^[23]

Allegations of hypocrisy[edit]

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein greets Donald Rumsfeld, a special envoy
   of President Ronald Reagan, in Baghdad on December 20, 1983. Rumsfeld
   came to discuss an aid program.^[24]

   The US has been criticized for making statements supporting peace and
   respecting national sovereignty, but whilst carrying out military
   actions such as in Grenada, fomenting a civil war in Colombia to break
   off Panama, and Iraq. The US has been criticised for advocating free
   trade but whilst protecting local industries with import tariffs on
   foreign goods such as lumber^[25] and agricultural products. The US has
   also been criticised for advocating concern for human rights whilst
   refusing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The US
   has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture, but has been
   criticized for condoning it in the School of the Americas. The US has
   advocated a respect for national sovereignty but has supported internal
   guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the Contras
   in Nicaragua.^[26]^[27] The US has been criticized for voicing concern
   about narcotics production in countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela
   but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid
   programs.^[28] The US has been criticized for not maintaining a
   consistent policy; it has been accused of denouncing alleged rights
   violations in China while supporting alleged human rights abuses by
   Israel.^[11]

   However, some defenders argue that a policy of rhetoric while doing
   things counter to the rhetoric was necessary in the sense of
   realpolitik and helped secure victory against the dangers of tyranny
   and totalitarianism.^[29]

   The US is advocating that Iran and North Korea should not develop
   nuclear weapons, while the US, the only country to have used nuclear
   weapons in warfare, maintains a nuclear arsenal of 5,113 warheads.
   However, this double-standard is legitimated by the Nuclear
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to which Iran is a party.

Actions of the United States[edit]

   Ranch, 25 April 2002.^[30] Human Rights Watch criticizes the Saudi
   officials for lack of institutional protection for human and civic
   rights.
   Critics charge that the U.S. supported brutal dictators such as Iranian
   Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Richard Nixon with Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in
   1971.

Support of dictatorships[edit]

   Main article: United States support of Authoritarian regimes

   The US has been criticized for supporting dictatorships with economic
   assistance and military hardware. Particular dictatorships have
   included Musharraf of Pakistan,^[31] the Shah of Iran,^[31] Museveni of
   Uganda,^[19] warlords in Somalia,^[19] Fulgencio Batista of Cuba,
   Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam,
   Park Chung-hee of South Korea, Generalissimo Franco of Spain, Melez
   Zenawi of Ethiopia and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.

Opposition to independent nationalism[edit]

   The US has been criticized by Noam Chomsky for opposing nationalist
   movements in foreign countries, including social
   reform.^[32]^[33]^[clarification needed]

Interference in internal affairs[edit]

   The United States was criticized for manipulating the internal affairs
   of foreign nations, including Guatemala,^[31] Chile,^[31] Cuba,^[13]
   Colombia,^[13] various countries in Africa^[19] including Uganda.^[19]
   See also Covert United States foreign regime change actions.

Promotion of democracy[edit]

   See also: American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North
   Africa

   Some critics argue that America's policy of advocating democracy may be
   ineffective and even counterproductive.^[34]^[35] Zbigniew Brzezinski
   declared that "[t]he coming to power of Hamas is a very good example of
   excessive pressure for democratization" and argued that George W.
   Bush's attempts to use democracy as an instrument against terrorism
   were risky and dangerous.^[36]^[36]^[36] Analyst Jessica Tuchman
   Mathews of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace agreed that
   imposing democracy "from scratch" was unwise, and didn't work.^[17]
   Realist critics such as George F. Kennan argued U.S. responsibility is
   only to protect its own citizens and that Washington should deal with
   other governments on that basis alone; they criticize president Woodrow
   Wilson's emphasis on democratization and nation-building although it
   wasn't mentioned in Wilson's Fourteen Points,^[37] and the failure of
   the League of Nations to enforce international will regarding Nazi
   Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan in the 1930s. Realist
   critics attacked the idealism of Wilson as being ill-suited for weak
   states created at the Paris Peace Conference. Others, however,
   criticize the U.S. Senate's decision not to join the League of Nations
   which was based on isolationist public sentiment as being one cause for
   the organization's ineffectiveness.

Undermining of human rights[edit]

   President Bush has been criticized for neglecting democracy and human
   rights by focusing exclusively on an effort to fight
   terrorism.^[19]^[19] The US was criticized for alleged prisoner abuse
   at Guantánamo Bay, Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and secret CIA prisons in
   eastern Europe, according to Amnesty International.^[38] In response,
   the US government claimed incidents of abuse were isolated incidents
   which did not reflect U.S. policy.

Excessive militarism[edit]

   President Barack Obama speaking on the military intervention in Libya
   at the National Defense University, March 2011

   In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. criticized excessive U.S. spending
   on military projects,^[39] and suggested a linkage between its foreign
   policy abroad and racism at home.^[39] In 1971, a Time Magazine
   essayist wondered why there were 375 major foreign military bases
   around the world with 3,000 lesser military facilities and concluded
   "there is no question that the U.S. today has too many troops scattered
   about in too many places."^[1] In a 2010 defense report, Cordesman
   criticized out-of-control military spending.^[40] Expenditures to fight
   the War on Terror are vast and seem limitless.^[41] The Iraq war was
   expensive and continues to be a severe drain on U.S.
   finances.^[17]^[17] Bacevich thinks the U.S. has a tendency to resort
   to military means to try to solve diplomatic problems.^[15] The US
   involvement in the Vietnam War was a costly, decade-long military
   engagement which ended in defeat, and the mainstream view today is that
   the entire intervention was a mistake.^[citation needed] The dollar
   cost was $111 billion, or $698 billion in 2009 dollars.^[42] Similarly,
   the second Iraq war was viewed by many^[who?] as being a mistake, since
   there were no weapons of mass destruction found, the war ended in
   December 2011.

Violation of international law[edit]

   Some critics^[who?] assert the US doesn't always follow international
   law. For example, some critics assert the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was
   not a proper response to an imminent threat, but an act of aggression
   which violated international law.^[43]^[44] For example, Benjamin
   Ferencz, a chief prosecutor of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg said George
   W. Bush should be tried for war crimes along with Saddam Hussein for
   starting aggressive wars—Saddam for his 1990 attack on Kuwait and Bush
   for his 2003 invasion of Iraq.^[45] Critics point out that the United
   Nations Charter, ratified by the U.S., prohibits members from using
   force against fellow members except against imminent attack or pursuant
   to an explicit Security Council authorization.^[46] A professor of
   international law asserted there was no authorization from the UN
   Security Council which made the invasion "a crime against the
   peace."^[46] However, US defenders argue there was such an
   authorization according to UN Security Council Resolution 1441. See
   also, United States War Crimes. The US has also supported Kosovo's
   independence even though it is strictly written in UN Security Council
   Resolution 1244 that Kosovo cannot be independent and it is stated as a
   Serbian province. The US has actively supported and pressured other
   countries to recognize Kosovo's independence.

Commitment to foreign aid[edit]

   Some critics charge that U.S. government aid should be higher given the
   high levels of Gross domestic product. They claim other countries give
   more money on a per capita basis, including both government and
   charitable contributions. By one index which ranked charitable giving
   as a percentage of GDP, the U.S. ranked 21 of 22 OECD countries by
   giving 0.17% of GDP to overseas aid, and compared the U.S. to Sweden
   which gave 1.03% of its GDP, according to different
   estimates.^[47]^[48] The U.S. pledged 0.7% of GDP at a global
   conference in Mexico.^[49] According to one estimate, U.S. overseas aid
   fell 16% from 2005 to 2006.^[50] However, since the US grants tax
   breaks to nonprofits, it subsidizes relief efforts abroad,^[51]
   although other nations also subsidize charitable activity abroad.^[52]
   Most foreign aid (79%) came not from government sources but from
   private foundations, corporations, voluntary organizations,
   universities, religious organizations and individuals. According to the
   Index of Global Philanthropy, the United States is the top donor in
   absolute amounts.^[53]

   Critics charge that savvy dictators such as Uganda's president Yoweri

   realpolitik and work with any type of government who can be helpful.

Historical foreign policy[edit]

   See also: Manifest destiny

   The U.S. has been criticized for its historical treatment of native
   Americans. For example, the treatment of Cherokee Indians in the Trail
   of Tears in which hundreds of Indians died in a forced evacuation from
   their homes in the southeastern area, along with massacres,
   displacement of lands, swindles, and breaking treaties. It has been
   criticized for the war with Mexico in the 1840s which some see as a
   theft of land. It has been criticised for being the first and only
   nation to use a nuclear bomb in wartime.

The Holocaust[edit]

   There has been sharp criticism about the U.S. response to the
   Holocaust: That it failed to admit Jews fleeing persecution from Europe
   at the beginning of World War II, and that it did not act decisively
   enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was
   the President at the time, was well-informed about the Hitler regime
   and its anti-Jewish policies,^[55] but the US State Department policies
   made it very difficult for Jewish refugees to obtain entry visas.
   Roosevelt similarly took no action on the Wagner-Rogers Bill, which
   could have saved 20,000 Jewish refugee children, following the arrival
   of 936 Jewish refugees on the MS St. Louis, who were denied asylum and
   were not allowed into the United States because of strict laws passed
   by Congress.^[56]

   During the era, the American press did not always publicize reports of
   Nazi atrocities in full or with prominent placement.^[57] By 1942,
   after newspapers began to report details of the Holocaust, articles
   were extremely short and were buried deep in the newspaper. These
   reports were either denied or unconfirmed by the United States
   government. When it did receive irrefutable evidence that the reports
   were true, (and photographs of mass graves and murder in Birkenau camp
   in 1943, with victims moving into the gas chambers) U.S. officials
   suppressed the information and classified it as secret.^[58] It is
   possible lives of European Jews could have been saved.

Alienation of allies[edit]

   There is evidence that many U.S. allies have been alienated by a
   unilateral approach. Allies signaled dissatisfaction with U.S. policy
   in a vote at the U.N.^[11] Brzezinski counsels listening to allies and
   exercising self-restraint.^[20]

Ineffective public relations[edit]

   One report suggests that news source Al-jazeera routinely paints the
   U.S. as evil throughout the Mideast.^[23] Other critics have faulted
   the U.S. public relations effort.^[4]^[19] As a result of faulty policy
   and lackluster public relations, the U.S. has a severe image problem in
   the Mideast, according to Anthony Cordesman.^[59] Analyst Jessica
   Tuchman Mathews writes that it appears to much of the Arab world that
   the United States went to war in Iraq for oil, regardless of the
   accuracy of that motive.^[17] In a 2007 poll by BBC News asking which
   countries are seen as having a "negative influence in the world," the
   survey found that Israel, Iran, United States and North Korea had the
   most negative influence, while nations such as Canada, Japan and the
   European Union had the most positive influence.^[60] The US has been
   accused by some U.N. officials of condoning actions by Israel against
   Palestinians.^[11] On the other hand, others have accused the US of
   being too supportive of the Palestinians.^[dubious – discuss]^[61]^[62]

Ineffective prosecution of war[edit]

   One estimate is that the second Iraq War along with the so-called War
   on Terror cost $551 billion, or $597 billion in 2009 dollars.^[63]
   Boston University professor Andrew Bacevich has criticized American
   profligacy^[16] and squandering its wealth.^[15] There have been
   historical criticisms of U.S. warmaking capability; in the War of 1812,
   the U.S. was unable to conquer Canada despite several attempts and
   having superior resources;^[1] the U.S. Capitol was burned and the
   settlement ending the war did not bring any major concessions from the
   British.^[64]
   Soldiers waiting nervously with rifles by a wall.
   The Vietnam War is largely viewed as an expensive and tragic
   decades-long mistake.

Problem areas festering[edit]

   Critics point to a list of countries or regions where continuing
   foreign policy problems continue to present problems. These areas
   include South America,^[65] including Ecuador,^[66] Venezuela,^[65]
   Bolivia, Uruguay, and Brazil. There are difficulties with Central
   American nations such as Honduras.^[67]^[67]^[67] Iraq has continuing
   troubles.^[68] Iran, as well, presents problems with nuclear
   proliferation.^[69] Pakistan is unstable,^[68] there is active conflict
   in Afghanistan.^[70] The Mideast in general continues to fester,^[17]
   although relations with India are improving.^[71] Policy towards Russia
   remains uncertain.^[72] China presents an economic challenge.^[17]^[73]
   There are difficulties in other regions too. In addition, there are
   problems not confined to particular regions, but regarding new
   technologies. Cyberspace is a constantly changing technological area
   with foreign policy repercussions.^[74] Climate change is an unresolved
   foreign policy issue, particularly depending on whether nations can
   agree to work together to limit possible future risks.^[17]

Ineffective strategy to fight terrorism[edit]

   Critic Cordesman criticized U.S. strategy to combat terrorism as not
   having enough emphasis on getting Islamic republics to fight terrorism
   themselves.^[75] Sometimes visitors have been misidentified as
   "terrorists."^[76] Mathews suggests the risk of nuclear terrorism
   remains unprevented.^[17] In 1999 during the Kosovo War, the US
   supported the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a that was recognised as a
   terrorist organisation by the US some years prior. Right before the
   1999 bombing of Yugoslavia took place, the US took down the KLA from
   the list of internationally recognized terrorist organizations in order
   to justify their aid and help to the KLA.

Historical instances of ineffective policies[edit]

   Generally during the 19th century, and in early parts of the 20th
   century, the U.S. pursued a policy of isolationism and generally
   avoided entanglements with European powers. After World War I, Time
   Magazine writer John L. Steele thought the U.S. tried to return to an
   isolationist stance, but that this was unproductive. He wrote: "The
   anti-internationalist movement reached a peak of influence in the years
   just before World War II."^[1] But Steele questioned whether this
   policy was effective; regardless, isolationism ended quickly after the
   surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.^[1] Analysts have wondered
   whether the U.S. pursued the correct strategy with Japan before World
   War II; by denying Japan access to precious raw materials, it is
   possible that U.S. policy triggered the surprise attack and, as a
   result, the U.S. had to fight a two-front war in both the Far East as
   well as Europe during World War II. While it may be the case that the
   Mideast is a difficult region with no easy solutions to avoiding
   conflict, since this volatile region is at the junction of three
   continents; still, many analysts think U.S. policy could have been
   improved substantially. The U.S. waffled; there was no vision;
   presidents kept changing policy. Public opinion in different regions of
   the world thinks that, to some extent, the 9/11 attacks were an
   outgrowth of substandard U.S. policy towards the region.^[77] The
   Vietnam War was a decade-long mistake.^[1] The US supported the
   secession of Kosovo form FR Yugoslavia in 1999 and continued to support
   its independence since. Such unilateral policies have broken European
   and international treaties but have been dismissed as unique by the US.
   Such unilateral secession support has helped inspire many notable
   secessionist uprisings in Spain, Belgium, Georgia, Russia, China, among
   others that have secessionist movements. However, the US has dismissed
   any similarities between those secessionist movements and Kosovo.

Role of internal government structure[edit]

Small role of Congress in foreign policy[edit]

   Critic Robert McMahon thinks Congress has been excluded from foreign
   policy decision making, and that this is detrimental.^[78] Other
   writers suggest a need for greater Congressional participation.^[17]

   Jim Webb, former Democratic senator from Virginia and former Secretary
   of the Navy in the Reagan administration, believes that Congress has an
   ever-decreasing role in U.S. foreign policy making. September 11, 2001
   precipitated this change, where “powers quickly shifted quickly to the
   Presidency as the call went up for centralized decision making in a
   traumatized nation where, quick, decisive action was considered
   necessary. It was considered politically dangerous and even unpatriotic
   to question this shift, lest one be accused of impeding national safety
   during a time of war.”^[79] Since that time, Webb thinks Congress has
   become largely irrelevant in shaping and executing of U.S. foreign
   policy. He cites the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA), the
   U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, and the 2011 military
   intervention in Libya as examples of growing legislative irrelevance.
   Regarding the SFA, “Congress was not consulted in any meaningful way.
   Once the document was finalized, Congress was not given the opportunity
   to debate the merits of the agreement, which was specifically designed
   to shape the structure of our long-term relations in Iraq” (11).
   “Congress did not debate or vote on this agreement, which set U.S.
   policy toward an unstable regime in an unstable region of the
   world.”^[79] The Iraqi Parliament, by contrast, voted on the measure
   twice. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement is
   described by the Obama Administration has a “legally binding executive
   agreement” that outlines the future of U.S.-Afghan relations and
   designated Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally. “It is difficult to
   understand how any international agreement negotiated, signed, and
   authored only by our executive branch of government can be construed as
   legally binding in our constitutional system,” Webb argues.^[79]
   Finally, Webb identifies the U.S. intervention in Libya as a troubling
   historical precedent. “The issue in play in Libya was not simply
   whether the president should ask Congress for a declaration of war. Nor
   was it wholly about whether Obama violated the edicts of the War Powers
   Act, which in this writer’s view he clearly did. The issue that remains
   to be resolved is whether a president can unilaterally begin, and
   continue, a military campaign for reasons that he alone defines as
   meeting the demanding standards of a vital national interest worth of
   risking American lives and expending billions of dollars of taxpayer
   money.”^[79] When the military campaign lasted months, President Barack
   Obama did not seek approval of Congress to continue military
   activity.^[79]

Presidential incompetency[edit]

   The presidency of George W. Bush has been attacked by numerous critics
   from both parties as being particularly incompetent, short-sighted,
   unthinking, and partisan.^[10] Bush's decision to launch the second
   Iraq War was criticized extensively;^[16]^[20] writer John Le Carre
   criticized it as a "hare-brained adventure."^[80] He was also
   criticized for advocating a policy of exporting
   democracy.^[34]^[36]^[36] Brzezinski described Bush's foreign policy as
   "a historical failure."^[20]^[20] Bush was criticized for being too
   secret regarding foreign policy and having a cabal subvert the proper
   foreign policy bureaucracy.^[4] Other presidents, too, were criticized.
   The foreign policy of George H. W. Bush was lackluster, and while he
   was a "superb crisis manager," he "missed the opportunity to leave a
   lasting imprint on U.S. foreign policy because he was not a strategic
   visionary," according to Brzezinski.^[20] He stopped the first Iraq War
   too soon without finishing the task of capturing Saddam Hussein.^[81]
   Foreign policy expert Henry Kissinger criticized Jimmy Carter for
   numerous foreign policy mistakes including a decision to admit the
   ailing Shah of Iran into the United States for medical treatment, as
   well as a bungled military mission to try to rescue the hostages in
   Teheran.^[82] Carter waffled from being "both too tough and too soft at
   the same time."^[82]

Difficulty removing an incompetent president[edit]

   Since the only way to remove an incompetent president is with the
   rather difficult policy of impeachment, it is possible for a marginally
   competent or incompetent president to stay in office for four to eight
   years and cause great mischief.^[83]^[84] In recent years, there has
   been great attention to this issue given the presidency of George W.
   Bush, but there have been questions raised about the competency of
   Jimmy Carter in his handling of the Iran hostage crisis.

Presidents may lack experience[edit]

   Since the constitution requires no prior experience in diplomacy,
   government, or military service, it is possible to elect presidents
   with scant foreign policy experience. Clearly the record of past
   presidents confirms this, and that presidents who have had extensive
   diplomatic, military, and foreign policy experience have been the
   exception, not the rule. In recent years, presidents had relatively
   more experience in such tasks as peanut farming, acting and governing
   governorships than in international affairs. It has been debated
   whether voters are sufficiently skillful to assess the foreign policy
   potential of presidential candidates, since foreign policy experience
   is only one of a long list of attributes in which voters tend to select
   candidates. The second Bush was criticized for inexperience in the
   Washington Post for being "not versed in international relations and
   not too much interested."^[4]

Lack of control over foreign policy[edit]

   During the early 19th century, general Andrew Jackson exceeded his
   authority on numerous times and attacked American Indian tribes as well
   as invaded the Spanish territory of Florida without official government
   permission. Jackson was not reprimanded or punished for exceeding his
   authority. Some accounts blame newspaper journalism called yellow
   journalism for whipping up virulent pro-war sentiment to help instigate
   the Spanish-American War. Some critics suggest foreign policy is
   manipulated by lobbies, such as the pro-Israel lobby^[85] or the Arab
   one, although there is disagreement about the influence of such
   lobbies.^[85] Nevertheless, Brzezinski wants stricter anti-lobbying
   laws.^[20]

Excessive authority of the presidency[edit]

   In contrast to criticisms that presidential attention is divided into
   competing tasks, some critics charge that presidents have too much
   power, and that there is the potential for tyranny or fascism. Some
   presidents circumvented the national security decision-making
   process.^[4] Critics such as Dana D. Nelson of Vanderbilt in her book
   Bad for Democracy^[86]^[87] and columnist David Sirota^[88]^[89] and
   Texas law professor Sanford Levinson^[90]^[91] see a danger in too much
   executive authority.

Over-burdened presidency[edit]

   Presidents have not only foreign policy responsibilities, but sizeable
   domestic duties too. In addition, the presidency is the head of a
   political party. As a result, it is tough for one person to manage
   disparate tasks, in one view. Critics suggest Reagan was overburdened,
   which prevented him from doing a good job of oversight regarding the
   Iran–Contra affair. Brzezinski suggested in Foreign Affairs that
   President Barack Obama is similarly overburdened.^[92] Some suggest a
   need for permanent non-partisan advisers.^[1]
