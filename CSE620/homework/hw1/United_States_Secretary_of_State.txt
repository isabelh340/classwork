           Website         www.state.gov

   The Secretary of State is a senior official of the federal government
   of the United States of America heading the U.S. Department of State,
   principally concerned with foreign affairs and is considered to be the
   U.S. government's equivalent of a Minister for Foreign Affairs.^[1]^[2]

   The Secretary of State, appointed by the President with the advice and
   consent of the Senate, is a member of the President's Cabinet, the
   National Security Council, and is the highest-ranking appointed
   executive branch official both in the presidential line of succession
   and the order of precedence.

   The Secretary of State along with the Secretary of the Treasury, the
   Secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General are generally regarded
   as the four most important cabinet members because of the importance of
   their respective departments.^[3] Secretary of State is a Level I
   position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed
   for that level.^[4]

   The current Secretary of State is John Kerry, the 68th person to hold
   the office since its creation in 1789.

Duties and responsibilities[edit]

   The specific duties of the Secretary of State include:^[5]
     * Organizes and supervises the entire United States Department of
       State and the United States Foreign Service.
     * Advises the President on matters relating to U.S. foreign policy,
       including the appointment of diplomatic representatives to other
       nations, and on the acceptance or dismissal of representatives from
       other nations.
     * Participates in high-level negotiations with other countries,
       either bilaterally or as part of an international conference or
       organization, or appoints representatives to do so. This includes
       the negotiation of international treaties and other agreements.
     * Responsible for overall direction, coordination, and supervision of
       interdepartmental activities of the U.S. Government overseas.
     * Providing information and services to U.S. citizens living or
       traveling abroad, including providing credentials in the form of
       passports and visas.
     * Supervises the United States immigration policy abroad.
     * Communicates issues relating the United States foreign policy to
       Congress and to U.S. citizens.

   The original duties of the Secretary of State include some domestic
   duties, such as:^[6]
     * Receipt, publication, distribution, and preservation of the laws of
       the United States
     * Preparation, sealing, and recording of the commissions of
       Presidential appointees
     * Preparation and authentication of copies of records and
       authentication of copies under the Department's seal
     * Custody of the Great Seal of the United States
     * Custody of the records of the former Secretary of the Continental
       Congress, except for those of the Treasury and War Departments

   Most of the domestic functions of the Department of State have been
   transferred to other agencies. Those that remain include storage and
   use of the Great Seal of the United States, performance of protocol
   functions for the White House, and the drafting of certain
   proclamations. The Secretary also negotiates with the individual States
   over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries.^[5] Under
   Federal Law,^[7]^[8] the resignation of a President or of a
   Vice-President is only valid if declared in writing, in an instrument
   delivered to the office of the Secretary of State. Accordingly, the
   resignations of President Nixon and of Vice-President Spiro Agnew,
   domestic issues, were formalized in instruments delivered to the
   Secretary of State.

   As the highest-ranking member of the cabinet, the Secretary of State is
   the third-highest official of the executive branch of the Federal
   Government of the United States, after the President and Vice President
   and is fourth in line to succeed the Presidency, coming after the Vice
   President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the
   President pro tempore of the Senate. Six Secretaries of State have gone
   on to be elected President. Others, including Kerry, Hillary Clinton,
   William Seward, and Henry Clay have been unsuccessful presidential
   candidates.

   What are the Qualifications of a Secretary of State? He ought to be a
   Man of universal Reading in Laws, Governments, History. Our whole
   terrestrial Universe ought to be summarily comprehended in his
   Mind.^[9]
   “
   ”
   —John Adams

   As the head of the United States Foreign Service, the Secretary of
   State is responsible for management of the diplomatic service of the
   United States. The foreign service employs about 12,000 people
   domestically and internationally, and supports 265 United States
   diplomatic missions around the world, including ambassadors to various
   nations.

   The nature of the position means that Secretaries of State engage in
   frequent travel around the world. The record for most countries visited
   in a secretary's tenure is 112, by Hillary Rodham Clinton.^[10] Second
   is Madeleine Albright with 96.^[11] The record for most air miles
   traveled in a secretary's tenure is 1,059,207, by Condoleezza
   Rice.^[12] Second is Clinton's 956,733 miles.^[10]

   When there is a vacancy in the office of Secretary of State, the duties
   are exercised either by another member of the cabinet, or, in more
   recent times, by a high-ranking official of the State Department until
   the President appoints, and the United States Senate confirms, a new
   Secretary.
