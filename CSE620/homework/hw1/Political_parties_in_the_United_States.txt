   This article presents the historical development and role of political
   parties in United States politics, and outlines more extensively the
   significant modern political parties. Throughout most of its history,
   American politics have been dominated by a two-party system. However,
   the United States Constitution has always been silent on the issue of
   political parties; at the time it was signed in 1787, there were no
   parties in the nation. Indeed, no nation in the world had voter-based
   political parties. The need to win popular support in a republic led to
   the American invention of political parties in the 1790s.^[1] Americans
   were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that
   linked public opinion with public policy through the party.^[2]

   Political scientists and historians have divided the development of
   America's two-party system into five eras.^[3] The modern two-party
   system consists of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
   Several third parties also operate in the U.S., and from time to time
   elect someone to local office.^[4] The largest third party since the
   1980s is the Libertarian Party.

   Since the 1930s, the modern American political spectrum and the usage
   of left–right politics have basically differed from the rest of the
   world. For example, among the two major parties, modern American
   Conservatism and the Republican Party support economic liberalism and
   classical liberalism's central principle of limited government, instead
   of modern American Liberalism and the Democratic Party.^[5]

Modern U.S. political party system[edit]

   U.S. party affiliation, 2007^[citation needed]

   The modern political party system in the U.S. is a two-party system
   dominated by the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These two
   parties have won every United States presidential election since 1852
   and have controlled the United States Congress to some extent since at
   least 1856.

Democratic Party[edit]

   Main article: Democratic Party (United States)

   The Democratic Party is one of two major political parties in the U.S.
   It is the oldest political party in the world.^[6]^[7]

   The Democratic Party, since the division of the Republican Party in the
   election of 1912, has positioned itself as the liberal party on
   domestic issues. The economic philosophy of Franklin D. Roosevelt,
   which has strongly influenced American liberalism, has shaped much of
   the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition
   controlled the White House until 1968 with the exception of Eisenhower
   1953-1961.

   In 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million voters
   (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.^[8] The
   president of the United States, Barack Obama, is the 15th Democrat to
   hold the office, and since the 2006 midterm elections, the Democratic
   Party is the majority party for the United States Senate.

   A 2011 USA Today review of state voter rolls indicates that registered
   Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register
   voters by party). Democrats were still the largest political party with
   more than 42 million voters (compared with 30 million Republicans and
   24 million independents). But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000,
   and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.^[9]

Republican Party[edit]

   Main article: Republican Party (United States)

   The Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political
   parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been
   nicknamed (by the media) the "Grand Old Party" or GOP, although it is
   younger than the Democratic Party.

   Founded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the
   Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of
   Abraham Lincoln, who used the party machinery to support victory in the
   American Civil War. The GOP dominated national politics during the
   Third Party System, from 1854 to 1896, and the Fourth Party System from
   1896 to 1932. Today, the Republican Party supports an American
   conservative platform, with further foundations in economic liberalism,
   fiscal conservatism, and social conservatism.

   Former President George W. Bush is the 19th Republican to hold that
   office. The party's nominee for President of the United States in the
   2012 presidential election was Mitt Romney, former Governor of
   Massachusetts. Since the 2010 midterm elections, the Republicans have
   held a majority in the United States House of Representatives.

   USA Today's review of state voter rolls indicates that registered
   Republicans declined in 21 of 28 states (not all states register voters
   by party) and that Republican registrations were down 350,000 in 2011.
   The number of independents rose in 18 states, increasing by 325,000 in
   2011, and was up more than 400,000 from 2008, or 1.7%.^[9]

Major third parties[edit]

Constitution Party[edit]

   Main article: Constitution Party (United States)

   The Constitution Party is a conservative United States political party.
   It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992. The party's
   official name was changed to the Constitution Party in 1999; however,
   some state affiliate parties are known under different names.

   According to ballot access expert Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot
   Access News, who periodically compiles and analyzes voter registration
   statistics as reported by state voter agencies, it ranks third
   nationally amongst all United States political parties in registered
   voters, with 438,222 registered members as of October 2008.^[10] This
   makes it currently the largest third party in the United States.

   The Constitution Party advocates a platform that they believe reflects
   the Founding Fathers' original intent of the U.S. Constitution,
   principles found in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and morals
   taken from the Bible.^[11]

   In 2006, Rick Jore of Montana became the first Constitution Party
   candidate elected to a state-level office,^[12]^[13] though the
   Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the
   national party a short time before the election.

   The Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was Virgil Goode.

Green Party[edit]

   Main article: Green Party (United States)

   In the United States, the Green Party has been active as a third party
   since the 1980s. The party first gained widespread public attention
   during Ralph Nader's second presidential run in 2000. Currently, the
   primary national Green Party organization in the U.S. is the Green
   Party of the United States, which has eclipsed the earlier Greens/Green
   Party USA.

   The Green Party in the United States has won elected office mostly at
   the local level; most winners of public office in the United States who
   are considered Greens have won nonpartisan-ballot elections (that is,
   elections in which the candidates' party affiliations were not printed
   on the ballot).^[14] In 2005, the Party had 305,000 registered members
   in the District of Columbia and 20 states that allow party
   registration.^[15] During the 2006 elections the party had ballot
   access in 31 states.^[16]

   Greens emphasize environmentalism, non-hierarchical participatory
   democracy, social justice, respect for diversity, peace and
   nonviolence.

Libertarian Party[edit]

   Main article: Libertarian Party (United States)

   The Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.^[17] It is one
   of the largest continuing third parties in the United States, claiming
   more than 331,000 registered voters.^[18] They currently have about 144
   elected officials, more than any of the other minor parties.^[19]

   The 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was
   former New Mexico governor, Gary Johnson. He achieved ballot access in
   every state except for Michigan (only as a write-in candidate) and
   Oklahoma. He received over one million votes in the election, the
   highest for any candidate since the founding of the party in 1971.
   Another Libertarian is Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. He is a
   promising figure in the Republican party but is widely considered a
   Libertarian. His father is Ron Paul, an Independent who have ran
   several times in Presidential election. In 2012, he got quiet a bit of
   support for being a 3rd party candidate.

   The Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence
   and expenditures of all levels of government. To this effect, the party
   supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful federal
   government, strong civil liberties, drug liberalization, separation of
   church and state, open immigration, non-interventionism and neutrality
   in diplomatic relations, free trade and free movement to all foreign
   countries, and a more representative republic.^[20]

Other parties[edit]

   Main article: List of political parties in the United States

   Besides the Constitution, Green and Libertarian parties, there are many
   other political parties that receive only minimal support and only
   appear on the ballot in one or a few states.

Independents[edit]

   Main article: Independent (politician) § United States

   Some political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with
   a particular political party. In some states, independents are not
   allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in
   any primary election of their choice. Independents can be of any
   political persuasion, but the term most commonly refers to politicians
   or voters who hold centrist views that incorporate facets of both
   Democratic and Republican ideology.

Party comparisons[edit]

   See also: Usage of "left–right" politics in the United States

   The following table lists some political ideologies most often
   associated with the five U.S. political parties with the most members,
   as well the tendencies of the official party positions on a number of
   reformist issues where positions diverge. Nuances may be found in the
   parties' respective platforms. Not all members of a party subscribe to
   all of its officially held positions, the usual degree of variation
   generally being higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold
   different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal
   levels. Furthermore, the modern American political spectrum, and the
   usage of left–right politics, differs from the rest of the world. For
   example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the
   country, generally supports a social liberalism position rather than a
   classical liberalism one.

History[edit]

   Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.
   Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.

   The United States Constitution has never formally addressed the issue
   of political parties. The Founding Fathers did not originally intend
   for American politics to be partisan. In Federalist Papers No. 9 and
   No. 10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote
   specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. In
   addition, the first President of the United States, George Washington,
   was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or
   throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that
   political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation,
   as outlined in his Farewell Address.^[46] Nevertheless, the beginnings
   of the American two-party system emerged from his immediate circle of
   advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist
   Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in
   this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists,
   given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with
   Madison and Thomas Jefferson helming this political faction, that
   created the environment in which, once distasteful partisanship, came
   to being.^[47]^[48]

First Party System: 1792-1824[edit]

   Main article: First Party System

   The First Party System of the United States featured the Federalist
   Party and the Democratic-Republican Party (Anti-Federalist). The
   Federalist Party grew from Washington's Secretary of the Treasury,
   Alexander Hamilton, who favored a strong united central government,
   close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links
   between the government and men of wealth. The Democratic-Republican
   Party was founded by James Madison and by Washington's Secretary of
   State, Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.^[49]
   Both parties had newspapers favoring them, with the Federalist paper
   being the Gazette of the United States and the Democratic-Republican
   paper being the National Gazette.

   The Era of Good Feelings (1816–1824), marked the end of the First Party
   System. The elitism of the Federalists had diminished their appeal, and
   their refusal to support the War of 1812 verged on secession and was a
   devastating blow when the war ended well. The Era of Good Feelings
   under President James Monroe (1816–24) marked a brief period in which
   partisanship was minimal.^[50] These good feelings inspired the first
   short-lived "era of internal improvements" from the 18th through the
   25th Congress, which ended with the panic of 1837.^[51]

Second Party System: 1828-1854[edit]

   Main article: Second Party System

   In 1829, the Second Party System saw a split of the
   Democratic-Republican Party into the Jacksonian Democrats, who grew
   into the modern Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig
   Party, led by Henry Clay. The Democrats supported the primacy of the
   Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed the Bank
   of the United States as well as modernizing programs that they felt
   would build up industry at the expense of the taxpayer. The Whigs, on
   the other hand, advocated the primacy of Congress over the executive
   branch as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism.
   Central political battles of this era were the Bank War and the Spoils
   system of federal patronage.

   The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of
   deaths in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as
   a result of the Compromise of 1850. In addition, the fading of old
   economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party
   together.

Third Party System: 1854-1890s[edit]

   Main article: Third Party System

   The Third Party System stretched from 1854 to the mid-1890s, and was
   characterized by the emergence of the anti-slavery Republican Party,
   which adopted many of the economic policies of the Whigs, such as
   national banks, railroads, high tariffs, homesteads and aid to land
   grant colleges. Civil war and Reconstruction issues polarized the
   parties until the Compromise of 1877, which ended the latter. Thus,
   both parties became broad-based voting coalitions. The race issue
   pulled newly enfranchised African Americans (Freedmen) into the
   Republican party while white southerners (Redeemers) joined the
   Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative
   pro-business Bourbon Democrats, traditional Democrats in the North
   (many of them former Copperheads), and Catholic immigrants, among
   others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop
   owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks and professionals who were attracted
   to the party's modernization policies.

Fourth Party System: 1896-1932[edit]

   Main article: Fourth Party System

   The Fourth Party System, 1896 to 1932, retained the same primary
   parties as the Third Party System, but saw major shifts in the central
   issues of debate. This period also corresponded to the Progressive Era,
   and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the
   Republicans blamed the Democrats for the Panic of 1893, which later
   resulted in William McKinley's victory over William Jennings Bryan in
   the 1896 presidential election. The central domestic issues changed to
   government regulation of railroads and large corporations ("trusts"),
   the protective tariff, the role of labor unions, child labor, the need
   for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary
   elections, direct election of senators, racial segregation, efficiency
   in government, women's suffrage, and control of immigration. Most
   voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place,
   giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new
   strength in the border states.

Fifth Party System: 1933-present[edit]

   Main article: Fifth Party System

   The Fifth Party System emerged with the New Deal Coalition beginning in
   1933.^[52] The Republicans began losing support after the Great
   Depression, giving rise to Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt
   and the activist New Deal. They promoted American Liberalism, anchored
   in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially ethno-religious
   constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners,
   well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals,
   and populist farm groups. Opposition Republicans were split between a
   conservative wing, led by Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, and a more
   successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern
   leaders such as Nelson Rockefeller, Jacob Javits, and Henry Cabot
   Lodge. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after
   1964.^[53]

   Experts debate whether this era ended (and a Sixth Party System
   subsequently emerged) in the mid-1960s when the New Deal coalition did,
   the early 1980s when the Moral Majority and the Reagan coalition were
   formed, the mid-1990s during the Republican Revolution, or continues to
   the present. Since the 1930s, the Democrats positioned themselves more
   towards Liberalism while the Conservatives increasingly dominated the
   GOP.^[54]

Minor parties and independents[edit]

   See also: Independent (politician) § United States

   Although American politics have been dominated by the two-party system,
   several other political parties have also emerged throughout the
   country's history. The oldest third party was the Anti-Masonic
   Party^[55] and was formed in upstate New York in 1828; the party's
   creators feared the Freemasons, believing they were a powerful secret
   society that was trying to rule the country in defiance of republican
   principles.

   Despite the large influence of political parties, a number of political
   candidates and voters refer to themselves as independents and choose
   not to identify with any particular political party at all. Several
   state governors and congressmen such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders
   have officially run as independents.
