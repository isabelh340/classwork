   The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly referred to as
   the United States (US or U.S.), America, and sometimes the States, is a
   federal republic^[16]^[17] consisting of 50 states and a federal
   district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central
   North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the
   northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an
   archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and
   nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At
   3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km^2) and with around 318
   million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest
   country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the
   world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product
   of large-scale immigration from many countries.^[18] The geography and
   climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home
   to a wide variety of wildlife.

   Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland
   around 15,000 years ago,^[19] with European colonization beginning in
   the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies
   located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and
   these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the
   colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War,
   delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of
   Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of
   independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain,
   and was the first successful war of independence against a European
   colonial empire.^[20]^[21] The current Constitution was adopted on
   September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the
   Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental
   civil rights and freedoms.

   Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked
   on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th
   century.^[22] This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new
   territories, and gradually admitting new states.^[22] The American
   Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.^[23] By the end of the
   19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,^[24]
   and its economy began to soar.^[25] The Spanish–American War and World
   War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The
   United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the
   first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the
   United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the
   dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole
   superpower.

   The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest
   national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23%
   of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity.^[5]^[26] The
   economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker
   productivity,^[27] with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest
   in 2010.^[5] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it
   continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.^[28] The U.S.
   has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the
   OECD as well as the highest gross average wage,^[29]^[30]^[31] though
   it has the 4th most unequal income distribution,^[32]^[33] with roughly
   15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S.
   Census.^[34] The country accounts for 37% of global military
   spending,^[35] being the world's foremost economic and military power,
   a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific
   research and technological innovation.^[36]^[37]^[38]^[39]^[40]

Etymology

   See also: Names for United States citizens

   In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world
   map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere "America"
   after the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin:
   Americus Vespucius).^[41] The first documentary evidence of the phrase
   "United States of America" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776,
   written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington's aide-de-camp and
   Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col.
   Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the "full and ample
   powers of the United States of America" to Spain to assist in the
   revolutionary war effort.^[42]

   The first publicly published evidence of the phrase "United States of
   America" was in an anonymously written essay in The Virginia Gazette
   newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.^[43]^[44] In
   June 1776, Thomas Jefferson included the phrase "UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original
   Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence.^[45]^[46] In the
   final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the pertinent section
   of the title was changed to read, "The unanimous Declaration of the
   thirteen united States of America".^[47] In 1777 the Articles of
   Confederation announced, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The
   United States of America'".^[48]

   The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms
   include the "U.S.", the "U.S.A.", and "America". Colloquial names
   include the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States".
   "Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 1700s,^[49]
   derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name
   "District of Columbia". In non-English languages, the name is
   frequently the translation of either the "United States" or "United
   States of America", and colloquially as "America". In addition, an
   abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.^[50]

   The phrase "United States" was originally treated as plural, a
   description of a collection of independent states—e.g., "the United
   States are"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States
   Constitution, ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as
   singular, a single unit—e.g., "the United States is"—after the end of
   the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is
   retained in the idiom "these United States".^[51] The difference has
   been described as more significant than one of usage, but reflecting
   the difference between a collection of states and a unit.^[52]

   The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an
   "American". "United States", "American" and "U.S." are used to refer to
   the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S. forces"). "American"
   is rarely used in English to refer to subjects not connected with the
   United States.^[53]

Native American and European contact

   Further information: Pre-Columbian era and Colonial history of the
   United States

   The first North American settlers migrated from Siberia by way of the
   Bering land bridge approximately 15,000 or more years
   ago.^[19]^[54]^[55] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian
   culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and
   state-level societies. After European explorers and traders made the
   first contacts, the native population declined due to various reasons,
   including diseases such as smallpox and measles,^[56]^[57]
   intermarriage,^[58] and violence.^[59]^[60]^[61]

   In the early days of colonization many settlers were subject to
   shortages of food, disease and attacks from Native Americans. Native
   Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied
   with Europeans in their colonial wars.^[62] At the same time however
   many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded
   for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other
   European wares.^[63] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how
   to cultivate corn, beans and squash in the frontier. European
   missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Indians
   and urged them to concentrate on farming and ranching without depending
   on hunting and gathering.^[64]^[65]

Settlements

   Further information: European colonization of the Americas and 13
   colonies
   Signing of the Mayflower Compact, 1620

   After Columbus' first voyage to the New World in 1492 other explorers
   and settlement followed into the Floridas and the American
   Southwest.^[66]^[67] There were also some French attempts to colonize
   the east coast, and later more successful settlements along the
   Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast
   of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown
   and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in
   communal living failed until the introduction of private farm
   holdings.^[68] Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came
   seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative
   assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, and the
   Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking,
   established precedents for the pattern of representative
   self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the
   American colonies.^[69]^[70]

   Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries
   developed. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction
   industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced
   rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing
   one-seventh of the world's iron supply.^[71] Cities eventually dotted
   the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English
   colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups.
   As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed
   further west.^[72] Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the
   Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by the English, but life
   expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and
   better food and treatment, so the numbers of slaves grew
   rapidly.^[73]^[74]^[75] Colonial society was largely divided over the
   religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts
   for and against the practice.^[76]^[77] But by the turn of the 18th
   century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash
   crop labor, especially in southern regions.^[78]

   With the colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would
   become the United States of America were established.^[79] All had
   local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing
   devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of
   self-government stimulating support for republicanism.^[80] With
   extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the
   colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American
   populations were eclipsed.^[81] The Christian revivalist movement of
   the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in
   both religion and religious liberty.

   In the French and Indian War, British forces seized Canada from the
   French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated
   from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were
   being conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of
   over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite
   continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by
   the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born
   overseas.^[82] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the
   development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to
   periodically seek to reassert royal authority.

Independence and expansion

   The Declaration of Independence: the Committee of Five presenting their
   draft to the Second Continental Congress in 1776
   Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States
   Declaration of Independence and American Revolution

   The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of
   independence against a European power. Americans had developed an
   ideology of "republicanism" that held government rested on the will of
   the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded
   their rights as Englishmen, “no taxation without representation”. The
   British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and
   the conflict escalated into war.^[83] Following the passage of the Lee
   Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for
   independence, the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, on
   July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created
   equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being
   protected by Great Britain, and finally declared, in the words of the
   resolution, that the 13 colonies were independent states and had no
   allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The latter date,
   July 4, 1776, is now celebrated annually as America's Independence Day.
   In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government
   that operated until 1789.^[84]

   Britain recognized the independence of the United States following
   their defeat at Yorktown.^[85] In the peace treaty of 1783, American
   sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the
   Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787
   in writing the United States Constitution, and it was ratified in state
   conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three
   branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in
   1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory,
   was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of
   Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and
   guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.^[86]

   Although the federal government criminalized the international slave
   trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton
   crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it the slave
   population.^[87]^[88]^[89] The Second Great Awakening, beginning about
   1800, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North it
   energized multiple social reform movements, including
   abolitionism;^[90] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized
   among slave populations.^[91]

   Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of
   Indian Wars.^[92] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in
   1803 almost doubled the nation's size.^[93] The War of 1812, declared
   against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw,
   strengthened U.S. nationalism.^[94] A series of U.S. military
   incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast
   territory in 1819.^[95] Expansion was aided by steam power, when
   steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which
   were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even
   faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.^[96]
   U.S. territorial acquisitions–portions of each territory were granted
   statehood since the 18th century.

   From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which
   included wider male suffrage, and it led to the rise of the Second
   Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828
   to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal
   policy that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations. The
   U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of
   expansionist Manifest Destiny.^[97] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain
   led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.^[98] Victory
   in the Mexican-American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of
   California and much of the present-day American Southwest.^[99]

   The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the
   creation of additional western states.^[100] After the American Civil
   War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers,
   expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native
   Americans.^[101] Over a half-century, the loss of the buffalo was an
   existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.^[102] In 1869, a new
   Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid
   further warfare, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship.^[103]

Civil War and Reconstruction Era

   Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction Era
   Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania during the Civil War

   From the beginning of the United States, inherent divisions over
   slavery between the North and the South in American society ultimately
   led to the American Civil War.^[104] Initially, states entering the
   Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional
   balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in
   population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional
   western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and
   free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of
   the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.^[105]

   Following the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president
   from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen
   states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States
   of America, while the U.S. federal government maintained secession was
   illegal.^[105] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863
   as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation
   Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war
   remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting
   in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many
   civilians.^[106]

   Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S.
   Constitution prohibited slavery, made the nearly four million African
   Americans who had been slaves^[107] U.S. citizens, and promised them
   voting rights. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase
   in federal power^[108] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the
   Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed
   slaves.^[109] But following the Reconstruction Era, throughout the
   South Jim Crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and
   some poor whites. Over the subsequent decades, in both the north and
   south blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination, including
   racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence, sparking national
   movements against these abuses.^[109]

Industrialization

   Further information: Labor history of the United States
   Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for the massive
   influx of immigration during the beginning of industrialization.

   In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants
   from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the
   country's industrialization and transformed its culture.^[110] National
   infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads
   spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the
   American Old West. The later invention of electric lights and
   telephones would also impact communication and urban life.^[111] The
   end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical
   cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. Mainland
   expansion was completed by the Alaska Purchase from Russia in 1867. In
   1898 the U.S. entered the world stage with important sugar production
   and strategic facilities acquired in Hawaii. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
   Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish
   American War.

   Rapid economic development at the end of the 19th century produced many
   prominent industrialists, and the U.S. economy became the world's
   largest. Dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the
   rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.^[112] This period
   eventually ended with the beginning of the Progressive Era, which saw
   significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage,
   alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust
   measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.

World War I, Great Depression, and World War II

   Further information: World War I, Great Depression and World War II
   U.S. troops approaching Omaha Beach during World War II

   The United States remained neutral at the outbreak of World War I in
   1914, though by 1917, it joined the Allies, helping to turn the tide
   against the Central Powers. President Woodrow Wilson took a leading
   diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and advocated
   strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the
   Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of
   Versailles that established the League of Nations.^[113]

   In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional
   amendment granting women's suffrage.^[114] The 1920s and 1930s saw the
   rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early
   television.^[115] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the
   Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After
   his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with
   the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security
   system.^[116] The Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming
   communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.

   The United States was at first effectively neutral during World War
   II's early stages but began supplying material to the Allies in March
   1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of
   Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United
   States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.^[117] Though the
   nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,^[118] it emerged relatively
   undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military
   influence.^[119] Allied conferences at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined
   a new system of international organizations that placed the United
   States and Soviet Union at the center of world affairs. As an Allied
   victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San
   Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active
   after the war.^[120] The United States developed the first nuclear
   weapons and used them on Japan; the Japanese surrendered on September
   2, ending World War II.^[121]

Cold War and civil rights era

   US President Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail
   Gorbachev, meeting in Geneva in 1985

   After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for
   power during what is known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological
   divide between capitalism and communism. They dominated the military
   affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and
   the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a
   policy of "containment" toward Soviet bloc expansion. While they
   engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two
   countries avoided direct military conflict. The U.S. often opposed
   Third World left-wing movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored.
   American troops fought Communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the
   Korean War of 1950–53. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first
   artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned
   spaceflight initiated a "Space Race" in which the United States became
   the first to land a man on the moon in 1969.^[122] A proxy war was
   expanded in Southeast Asia with the Vietnam War.

   At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid
   growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an
   interstate highway system transformed the nation’s infrastructure over
   the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to
   large suburban housing developments.^[123]^[124] A growing civil rights
   movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination,
   with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead.
   A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the
   Civil Rights Act of 1964, sought to end racial
   discrimination.^[125]^[126]^[127] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement
   grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black
   nationalism, and the sexual revolution. The launch of a "War on
   Poverty" expanded entitlement and welfare spending.^[128]

   The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his
   election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic
   stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of
   détente, he abandoned "containment" and initiated the more aggressive
   "rollback" strategy towards the USSR.^[129]^[130]^[131]^[132]^[133]
   After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade,
   by 1985 a majority of women age 16 and over were employed.^[134] The
   late 1980s brought a "thaw" in relations with the USSR, and its
   collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.^[135]^[136]^[137]^[138]

   After the Cold War, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in
   modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.^[139] Originating in U.S. defense
   networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and
   then to the public in the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy,
   society, and culture.^[140] On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists
   struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near
   Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.^[141] In response the
   United States launched the War on Terror, which includes the ongoing
   war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.^[142]^[143] Barack Obama,
   the first African-American president, was elected in 2008 amid the
   Great Recession.^[144]

Geography, climate, and environment

   Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United
   States and Environment of the United States
   A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and
   surrounding areas

   The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles
   (7,663,941 km^2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States
   by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles
   (1,717,856 km^2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central
   Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles
   (28,311 km^2) in area.^[145]

   The United States is the world's third or fourth largest nation by
   total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just
   above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two
   territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total
   size of the United States is measured: calculations range from
   3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055 km^2)^[146] to 3,717,813 square miles
   (9,629,091 km^2)^[147] to 3,794,101 square miles
   (9,826,676 km^2).^[148] Measured by only land area, the United States
   is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.^[149]

   The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to
   deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont. The
   Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes
   and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the
   world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through
   the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains
   stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the
   southeast.

   The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend
   north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than
   14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great
   Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave. The Sierra Nevada
   and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges
   reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and
   highest points in the continental United States are in the state of
   California, and only about 80 miles (130 km) apart. At 20,320 feet
   (6,194 m), Alaska's Mount McKinley is the tallest peak in the country
   and in North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's
   Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic
   islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the
   Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.^[150]

   The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes
   most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate
   ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the
   south. The southern tip of Florida is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great
   Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western
   mountains are alpine. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in
   the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in
   coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is
   subarctic or polar. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states
   bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the
   world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in the Midwest's
   Tornado Alley.^[151]
   The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since
   1782.

   The U.S. ecology is considered "megadiverse": about 17,000 species of
   vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and
   over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of
   which occur on the mainland.^[152] The United States is home to more
   than 400 mammal, 750 bird, and 500 reptile and amphibian species.^[153]
   About 91,000 insect species have been described.^[154] The bald eagle
   is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and
   is an enduring symbol of the country itself.^[155]

   There are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed
   parks, forests, and wilderness areas.^[156] Altogether, the government
   owns 28.8% of the country's land area.^[157] Most of this is protected,
   though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or
   cattle ranching; 2.4% is used for military purposes.^[157]^[158]^[159]

   Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970.
   Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy,
   dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting
   wildlife, logging and deforestation,^[160]^[161] and international
   responses to global warming.^[162]^[163] Many federal and state
   agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.^[164]
   The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since
   1964, with the Wilderness Act.^[165] The Endangered Species Act of 1973
   is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their
   habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife
   Service.

   The Statue of Liberty in New York City is a symbol of both the U.S. and
   the ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.^[167]

   The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the country's population now to be
   318,753,000,^[4] including an approximate 11.2 million illegal
   immigrants.^[168] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th
   century, from about 76 million in 1900.^[169] The third most populous
   nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the
   only major industrialized nation in which large population increases
   are projected.^[170]

   The United States has a very diverse population—31 ancestry groups have
   more than one million members.^[171] German Americans are the largest
   ethnic group (more than 50 million) - followed by Irish Americans
   (circa 35 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English
   Americans (circa 27 million).^[172]

   White Americans are the largest racial group; Black Americans are the
   nation's largest racial minority and third largest ancestry
   group.^[171] Asian Americans are the country's second largest racial
   minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese
   Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.^[171]

   With a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, 35% below the world average, its
   population growth rate is positive at 0.9%, significantly higher than
   those of many developed nations.^[173] In fiscal year 2012, over one
   million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification)
   were granted legal residence.^[174] Mexico has been the leading source
   of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the
   Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every
   year.^[175]^[176]

   According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million
   Americans, or roughly 3.5% of the adult population identify themselves
   as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.^[177] A 2012 Gallup poll also
   concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest
   percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest
   state was North Dakota at 1.7%.^[178]

   In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people
   with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million
   exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian
   or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).^[179] The census
   counted more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were
   "unable to identify with any" of its five official race categories in
   2010.^[179]

   The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are
   officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5
   million Americans of Hispanic descent^[179] are identified as sharing a
   distinct "ethnicity" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans
   are of Mexican descent.^[180] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's
   Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population
   rose just 4.9%.^[181] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007,
   12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure
   born in Latin America.^[182]

   Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic (of any race)
   woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for
   non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both
   below the replacement rate of 2.1).^[183] Minorities (as defined by the
   Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites)
   constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010,^[184] and over 50% of
   children under age one,^[185] and are projected to constitute the
   majority by 2042.^[186] This contradicts the report by the National
   Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which
   concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were
   non-Hispanic white.^[183]

   About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);^[148]
   about half of those reside in cities with populations over
   50,000.^[187] In 2008, 273 incorporated places had populations over
   100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four
   global cities had over two million (New York City, Los Angeles,
   Chicago, and Houston).^[188] There are 52 metropolitan areas with
   populations greater than one million.^[189] Of the 50 fastest-growing
   metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.^[190] The metro areas of
   Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million
   people between 2000 and 2008.^[189]

   English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although
   there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as
   U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about
   230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke
   only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home,
   is the second most common language and the most widely taught second
   language.^[194]^[195] Some Americans advocate making English the
   country's official language, as it is in at least 28 states.^[8]

   Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state
   law.^[196] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws
   providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does
   for English and French.^[197] Other states, such as California, mandate
   the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents
   including court forms.^[198] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of
   non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting
   information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those
   jurisdictions.

   Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native
   languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by
   American Samoa and Guam, respectively;^[citation needed] Carolinian and
   Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;^[citation
   needed] Cherokee is officially recognized by the Cherokee Nation within
   the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma; Spanish is
   an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than
   English there.^[199]

   The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free
   exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting
   its establishment. Christianity is by far the most common religion
   practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013
   survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a "very important
   role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other
   wealthy nation.^[201] In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that
   they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a
   low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.^[202] As with
   other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious.
   Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.^[203] Polls
   show that overall American confidence in organized religion is
   declining,^[204] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming
   increasingly irreligious.^[205]

   According to a 2012 survey, 73% of adults identified themselves as
   Christian,^[206] down from 86.4% in 1990.^[207] Protestant
   denominations accounted for 48%, while Roman Catholicism, at 22%, was
   the largest individual denomination.^[206] The total reporting
   non-Christian religions in 2012 was 6%, up from 4% in 2007.^[206] Other
   religions include Judaism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%),
   Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%).^[206] The survey
   also reported that 19.6% of Americans described themselves as agnostic,
   atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in
   1990.^[206]^[207]^[208] There are also Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto,
   Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist
   communities.^[209]

   Protestantism is the largest group of religions in the United States,
   with Baptists being the largest Protestant sect, and the Southern
   Baptist Convention being the largest Protestant denomination in the
   U.S. About 19 percent of Protestants are Evangelical, while 15 percent
   are mainline and 8 percent belong to a traditionally Black church.
   Roman Catholicism in the U.S. has its origin in the Spanish and French
   colonization of the Americas, and later grew due to Irish, Italian,
   Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island is the only state
   where the majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in the
   U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe. North and
   South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population
   is Lutheran. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of
   the majority of the population. Mormonism is also relatively common in
   parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.

   The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United
   States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a
   significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across
   the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By
   contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in
   the Western United States.^[202]

Family structure

   Main article: Family structure in the United States

   In 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were
   widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.^[210] Women
   now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's
   degrees.^[211]

   The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate, 79.8 per 1,000 women, is the highest
   among OECD nations.^[212] Between 2007 and 2010, the highest teenage
   birth rate was in Mississippi, and the lowest in New Hampshire.^[213]
   Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973
   landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court. While the
   abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live
   births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher
   than those of most Western nations.^[214] In 2011, the average age at
   first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.^[215]
   The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births
   per woman.^[216] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively
   easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western
   countries).^[217] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S.
   accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions
   worldwide.^[218] The legal status of same-sex couples adopting varies
   by jurisdiction.

   Same-sex marriage is legally permitted in 19 U.S. states, 10 Native
   American tribal jurisdictions, and the District of Columbia. Limited
   recognition has been granted to out-of-state same-sex marriages in
   Alaska, Colorado,^[219] Missouri, Utah, and Ohio.^[220] Polygamy is
   illegal throughout the U.S.^[221] Although cousin marriages are illegal
   in most states, they are legal in many states, the District of Columbia
   and some territories. Some states have some restrictions or exceptions
   for cousin marriages and/or recognize such marriages performed
   out-of-state.

   The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a
   constitutional republic and representative democracy, "in which
   majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law".^[222]
   The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined
   by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal
   document.^[223] For 2012, the U.S. ranked 21st on the Democracy
   Index^[224] and 19th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.^[225]

   In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to
   three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local
   government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal
   governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials
   are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no
   proportional representation at the federal level, and it is very rare
   at lower levels.
   Political system of the United States

   The federal government is composed of three branches:
     * Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the
       House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves
       treaties, has the power of the purse,^[226] and has the power of
       impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the
       government.^[227]
     * Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military,
       can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to
       Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet
       (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and
       enforce federal laws and policies.^[228]
     * Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges
       are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws
       and overturn those they find unconstitutional.

   The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing
   a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are
   apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the
   2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while
   California, the most populous state, had 53.^[229]

   The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected
   at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for
   election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and
   may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not
   elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in
   which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the
   District of Columbia.^[230] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice
   of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.^[231]

   The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion;
   Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.^[232] The governor
   (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges
   and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective
   states, while others are elected by popular vote.

   The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and
   responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with
   the individual states. Article One protects the right to the "great
   writ" of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27
   times;^[233] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of
   Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of
   Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are
   subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in
   violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial
   review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established
   by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)^[234] in a decision
   handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.^[235]

Political divisions

   Territories of the United States and List of states and territories of
   the United States
   Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and
   United States territorial acquisitions

   The United States is a federal union of 50 states. The original 13
   states were the successors of the 13 colonies that rebelled against
   British rule. Early in the country's history, three new states were
   organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing
   states: Kentucky from Virginia; Tennessee from North Carolina; and
   Maine from Massachusetts. Most of the other states have been carved
   from territories obtained through war or purchase by the U.S.
   government. One set of exceptions includes Vermont, Texas, and Hawaii:
   each was a well-established independent republic before joining the
   union. During the American Civil War, West Virginia broke away from
   Virginia. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on August 21,
   1959.^[236] The states do not have the right to unilaterally secede
   from the union.

   The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass. The District of
   Columbia is a federal district which contains the capital of the United
   States, Washington D.C. The United States also possesses five major
   overseas territories: Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands
   in the Caribbean; and American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana
   Islands in the Pacific.^[237] Those born in the major territories are
   birthright U.S. citizens except Samoans. Samoans born in American Samoa
   are born U.S. nationals, and may become naturalized citizens.^[238]
   American citizens residing in the territories have fundamental
   constitutional protections and elective self-government, with a
   territorial Member of Congress, but they do not vote for president as
   states. Territories have personal and business tax regimes different
   from that of states.^[239]

   The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the Native
   Nations. Though reservations are within state borders, the reservation
   is a sovereign entity. While the United States recognizes this
   sovereignty, other countries may not.^[240]

   The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its
   history.^[241] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered
   primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent
   general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major
   parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the
   Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one
   third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt,
   running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular
   vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party.

   Within American political culture, the Republican Party is considered
   center-right or conservative and the Democratic Party is considered
   center-left or liberal.^[242] The states of the Northeast and West
   Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as "blue states", are
   relatively liberal. The "red states" of the South and parts of the
   Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.

   The winner of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack
   Obama, is the 44th U.S. president.

   In the 113th United States Congress, the House of Representatives is
   controlled by the Republican Party, while the Democratic Party has
   control of the Senate. The Senate currently consists of 52 Democrats,
   two independents who caucus with the Democrats, and 46 Republicans; the
   House consists of 234 Republicans and 201 Democrats.^[243] There are 30
   Republican and 20 Democratic state governors.^[244]

   Since the founding of the United States until the 2000s, the country's
   governance has been primarily dominated by White Anglo-Saxon
   Protestants (WASPs). However, the situation has changed recently and of
   the top 17 positions (four national candidates of the two major party
   in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, four leaders in 112th United
   States Congress, and nine Supreme Court Justices) there is only one
   WASP.^[245]^[246]^[247]
   The United Nations Headquarters has been situated in Midtown Manhattan
   since 1952.

Foreign relations

   Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign
   policy of the United States
   See also: Covert United States foreign regime change actions

   The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It
   is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New
   York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of
   the G8,^[248] G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C.,
   and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all
   nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Cuba, Iran, North
   Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal
   diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still
   supplies Taiwan with military equipment).

   The United States has a "special relationship" with the United
   Kingdom^[249] and strong ties with Canada,^[250] Australia,^[251] New
   Zealand,^[252] the Philippines,^[253] Japan,^[254] South Korea,^[255]
   Israel,^[256] and several EU countries, including France, Italy,
   Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on
   military and security issues and with its neighbors through the
   Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the
   trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
   In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official
   development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America's
   large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of
   0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas
   giving by Americans is relatively generous.^[257]

   The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and
   responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free
   Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau, all of
   which are Pacific island nations which were part of the
   U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning
   after World War II, and gained independence in subsequent years.

Government finance

   See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal
   budget

   Taxes are levied in the United States at the federal, state and local
   government level. These include taxes on income, payroll, property,
   sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010
   taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to
   24.8% of GDP.^[258] During FY2012, the federal government collected
   approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6%
   versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories
   included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social
   Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes
   ($242B or 10%).^[259]

   U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income
   taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed
   world,^[260]^[261]^[262]^[263]^[264] but the incidence of corporate
   income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for
   decades.^[265]^[266]^[267]^[268] In 2009 the top 10% of earners, with
   36% of the nation's income, paid 78.2% of the federal personal income
   tax burden, while the bottom 40% had a negative liability.^[263]
   However, payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax,
   with no tax charged on income above $113,700 and no tax at all paid on
   unearned income from things such as stocks and capital
   gains.^[269]^[270] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of
   the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as
   welfare transfers.^[271]^[272] The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal
   taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income,
   paid 22.3% of federal taxes.^[263] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center
   projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%,
   27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7%
   for the bottom quintile.^[273]^[274] State and local taxes vary widely,
   but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely
   heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield
   less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not
   eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.^[261]^[275]

   During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget
   or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60
   trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &
   Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%),
   Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or
   17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).^[259]

National debt

   US federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to
   2013
   Main article: National debt of the United States

   The total national debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106%
   of the GDP), according to an estimate for 2014 by the International
   Monetary Fund.^[276] In May 2014, U.S. federal government debt held by
   the public was approximately $12.495 trillion, or about 75% of U.S.
   GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a
   combined total debt of $17.494 trillion.^[277]^[278] By 2012, total
   federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.^[279] The U.S. has a
   credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and Aaa
   from Moody's.^[280]

   Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of GDP increased during
   wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. For example, debt held
   by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of
   GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent
   decades, large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have
   led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal
   government's fiscal policies.^[281] However, these concerns are not
   universally shared.^[282]

   The president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's
   armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the
   Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense
   administers the armed forces, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,
   and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland
   Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of
   war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active
   duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of
   troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about
   700,000 civilians, not including contractors.^[283]

   Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime
   through the Selective Service System.^[284] American forces can be
   rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft,
   the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine Expeditionary Units
   at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military
   operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,^[285] and maintains
   deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign
   countries.^[286] The extent of this global military presence has
   prompted some scholars to describe the United States as maintaining an
   "empire of bases".^[287]

   The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700
   billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14
   largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the
   rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after
   Saudi Arabia.^[288] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked
   23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.^[289] Defense's share of
   U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War
   peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to
   4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.^[290]

   The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion,
   was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed
   for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.^[291] The last
   American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;^[292] 4,484
   servicemen were killed during the Iraq War.^[293] Approximately 90,000
   U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;^[294] by
   November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in
   Afghanistan.^[295]

Crime and law enforcement

   United States
   See also: Law of the United States, Capital punishment in the United
   States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and Human
   rights in the United States § Justice system
   Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police
   departments. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest
   in the country.^[296]

   Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of
   local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing
   broader services. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized
   duties.^[297] At the federal level and in almost every state,
   jurisprudence operates on a common law system. State courts conduct
   most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes
   as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea
   bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of
   criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than
   jury trial.^[298]^[299]

   In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United
   States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in
   1980.^[300]^[301]^[302] Among developed nations, the United States has
   above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of
   gun violence and homicide.^[303] A cross-sectional analysis of the
   World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2003 showed that
   United States "homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the
   other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were
   19.5 times higher."^[304] Gun ownership rights continue to be the
   subject of contentious political debate.

   Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain
   federal and military crimes, and used in 32 states.^[305] No executions
   took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court
   ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In
   1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital
   punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there
   have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place
   in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.^[306] Meanwhile,
   several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws.
   In 2010, the country had the fifth highest number of executions in the
   world, following China, Iran, North Korea, and Yemen.^[307]

   The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and
   total prison population in the world.^[308]^[309]^[310]^[311] At the
   start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more
   than one in every 100 adults.^[312] The prison population has
   quadrupled since 1980.^[313] African-American males are jailed at about
   six times the rate of white males and three times the rate of Hispanic
   males.^[314] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to
   changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.^[315] In 2008,
   Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate, and Maine the
   lowest.^[316] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and
   non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the
   lowest.^[317]

   United States export treemap (2011): The U.S. is the world's
   second-largest exporter.

   The United States has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by
   abundant natural resources and high productivity.^[325] According to
   the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion
   constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and
   over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity
   (PPP).^[5] Its national GDP was about 5% larger at PPP in 2014 than the
   European Union's, whose population is around 62% higher.^[326] However,
   the US's nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014,
   which is about 5% smaller than that of the European Union.^[327] From
   1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared
   to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.^[328] The country
   ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per
   capita at PPP.^[5] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve
   currency.^[329]

   The United States is the largest importer of goods and second largest
   exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the
   total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.^[330] Canada, China, Mexico,
   Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.^[331] In 2010, oil was
   the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the
   country's largest export.^[330] China is the largest foreign holder of
   U.S. public debt.^[332] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are
   American entities, including federal government accounts and the
   Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the
   debt.^[333]^[334]^[335]^[336]

   In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the
   economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state
   and local government activity (including federal transfers) the
   remaining 9.3%.^[337] While its economy has reached a postindustrial
   level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP,
   the United States remains an industrial power.^[338] The leading
   business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail
   trade; by net income it is manufacturing.^[339]

   Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.^[340] The United
   States is the third largest producer of oil in the world, as well as
   its largest importer.^[341] It is the world's number one producer of
   electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur,
   phosphates, and salt. While agriculture accounts for just under 1% of
   GDP,^[338] the United States is the world's top producer of corn^[342]
   and soybeans.^[343] The National Agricultural Statistics Service
   maintains agricultural statistics^[dead link] for products that include
   peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers,
   and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and
   dairy products. The National Mining Association provides data
   pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead,
   magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.^[344]^[345] In the franchising
   business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized
   brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink
   company in the world.^[346]

   Consumer spending comprises 71% of the U.S. economy in 2013.^[347] In
   August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million
   people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of
   employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and
   social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are
   unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.^[348] The World Bank
   ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing
   workers.^[349] The United States is the only advanced economy that does
   not guarantee its workers paid vacation^[350] and is one of just a few
   countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with
   the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.^[351] In 2009,
   the United States had the third highest labor productivity per person
   in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in
   productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the
   Netherlands.^[352]

   The 2008-2012 global recession had a significant impact on the United
   States, with output still below potential according to the
   Congressional Budget Office.^[353] It brought high unemployment (which
   has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with
   low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and
   increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating
   federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices.
   There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed, continued
   decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget
   increases.^[354]^[355]^[356] A 2011 poll found that more than half of
   all Americans think the U.S. is still in recession or even depression,
   despite official data that shows a historically modest recovery.^[357]
   In 2011 the Census Bureau defined poverty rate increased to roughly 16%
   of the population.^[358]

   Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United
   States and Affluence in the United States

   Americans have the highest average household and employee income among
   OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second highest median household
   income.^[30]^[359] According to the Census Bureau real median household
   income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144 in 2010.^[360] The Global
   Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability
   and overall food security in March 2013.^[361] Americans on average
   have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as
   European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.^[362] For 2013
   the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th
   among 187 countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its
   inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).^[363]

   There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes
   since the 1970s.^[364] While inflation-adjusted ("real") household
   income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has
   since been flat and even decreased recently.^[365] The rise in the
   share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has
   more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has had
   a significant impact on income inequality,^[366] leaving the United
   States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD
   nations.^[367]^[368]^[369] The post-recession income gains have been
   very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent of the income
   gains from 2009 to 2012.^[370]

   Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10%
   of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth,
   while the bottom half claim only 2%.^[371] This is the second-highest
   share among developed nations.^[372] Between June 2007 and November
   2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world.
   Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.^[373]
   Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth is down
   $14 trillion.^[374] At the end of 2008, household debt amounted to
   $13.8 trillion.^[375]

   There were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in
   the U.S. in January 2009, with almost two-thirds staying in an
   emergency shelter or transitional housing program. In 2011 16.7 million
   children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007
   levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food
   intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and
   most cases were not chronic.^[376]

   Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a
   network of 13 million roads, including one of the world's longest
   highway systems.^[378] The world's second largest automobile
   market,^[379] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita
   vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000
   Americans.^[380] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or
   light trucks.^[381] The average American adult (accounting for all
   drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling
   29 miles (47 km).^[382]

   Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.^[383]^[384]
   While transport of goods by rail is extensive, relatively few people
   use rail to travel,^[385] though ridership on Amtrak, the national
   intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and
   2010.^[386] Also, light rail development has increased in recent
   years.^[387] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.^[388]

   The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been
   largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly
   owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried
   are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013
   acquisition of US Airways.^[389] Of the world's 30 busiest passenger
   airports, 12 are in the United States, including the busiest,
   Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.^[390]

Energy

   The Hoover Dam when completed in 1936 was both the world's largest
   electric-power generating station and the world's largest concrete
   structure.
   See also: Energy policy of the United States

   The United States energy market is 29,000 terawatt hours per year.
   Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent per year,
   the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came
   from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder
   was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.^[391] The
   United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.^[392]

   For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many
   other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the
   wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear
   plants were filed.^[393] The United States has 27% of global coal
   reserves.^[394] It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and
   crude oil.^[395]

   The United States has been a leader in scientific research and
   technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876,
   Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the
   telephone. Thomas Edison's laboratory developed the phonograph, the
   first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.^[396]
   In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds
   and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in
   1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered
   flight.^[397]

   The rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including
   Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to
   the United States.^[398] During World War II, the Manhattan Project
   developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age. The Space Race
   produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and
   computers.^[399] Advancements by American microprocessor companies such
   as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer
   software and hardware companies that include Sun Microsystems, IBM,
   GNU-Linux, Apple Computer, and Microsoft refined and popularized the
   personal computer.^[400]

   The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department
   requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which
   evolved into the Internet. Today, 64% of research and development
   funding comes from the private sector.^[401] The United States leads
   the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.^[402] As of
   April 2010, 77% of American households owned at least one computer, and
   68% had broadband Internet service.^[403] 85% of Americans also own a
   mobile phone as of 2011.^[404] The country is the primary developer and

   The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one
   of the many public universities in the United States.

   American public education is operated by state and local governments,
   regulated by the United States Department of Education through
   restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required
   to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten
   or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through
   twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to
   leave school at 16 or 17.^[406] About 12% of children are enrolled in
   parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are
   homeschooled.^[407] The U.S. spends more on education per student than
   any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary
   student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.^[408]
   Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.^[409]

   The United States has many competitive private and public institutions
   of higher education. According to prominent international rankings, 13
   or 15 American colleges and universities are ranked among the top 20 in
   the world.^[410]^[411] There are also local community colleges with
   generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and
   lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high
   school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree,
   and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.^[412] The basic literacy rate is
   approximately 99%.^[148]^[413] The United Nations assigns the United
   States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the
   world.^[414]

   As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some
   other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average,
   and more than all nations in combined public and private
   spending.^[408]^[415] As of 2012, student loan debt exceeded one
   trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.^[416]

Health

   The United States has a life expectancy of 78.4 years at birth, up from
   75.2 years in 1990, ranking it 50th among 221 nations, and 27th out of
   the 34 industrialized OECD countries, down from 20th in
   1990.^[417]^[418] Increasing obesity in the United States and health
   improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering the country's rank
   in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world.^[419]
   Obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the
   world.^[420] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese
   and an additional third is overweight;^[421] the obesity rate, the
   highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled in the last
   quarter-century.^[422] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered
   epidemic by health care professionals.^[423] The infant mortality rate
   of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224
   countries.^[424]

   In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic
   obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most
   years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression,
   musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years
   lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet,
   tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar,
   physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse,
   kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years
   of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.^[418] U.S.
   teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in
   other Western nations.

   The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely
   developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most
   important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of
   physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.
   Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine than
   the rest of the world. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was
   invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in
   Europe.^[425]^[426] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other
   nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of
   GDP.^[427] Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination
   of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2010, 49.9
   million residents or 16.3% of the population did not carry health
   insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a
   major political issue.^[428]^[429] In 2006, Massachusetts became the
   first state to mandate universal health insurance.^[430] Federal
   legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a
   near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014,
   though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of
   controversy.^[431]^[432]

Culture

   Main article: Culture of the United States
   See also: Social class in the United States, Public holidays in the
   United States and Tourism in the United States

   The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic
   groups, traditions, and values.^[18]^[433] Aside from the relatively
   small Native American and Native Hawaiian populations, nearly all
   Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five
   centuries.^[434] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture
   largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with
   influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by
   slaves from Africa.^[18]^[435] More recent immigration from Asia and
   especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been
   described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad
   bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive
   cultural characteristics.^[18]

   Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists
   and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived
   passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through
   assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a
   strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a
   unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality,
   private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited
   government.^[436] Americans are extremely charitable by global
   standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of
   GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the
   second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the
   French figure of 0.14%.^[437]^[438]

   The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social
   mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.^[439] Whether this
   perception is realistic has been a topic of
   debate.^[440]^[441]^[442]^[443]^[328]^[444] While mainstream culture
   holds that the United States is a classless society,^[445] scholars
   identify significant differences between the country's social classes,
   affecting socialization, language, and values.^[446] Americans'
   self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are
   associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.^[447]
   While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being
   ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.^[448]

Mass media

   Main articles: Media of the United States and Television in the United
   States

   The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting
   Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American
   Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. Americans are the heaviest
   television viewers in the world,^[449] and the average viewing time
   continues to rise, reaching five hours a day in 2006.^[450] The four
   major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities.
   Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on
   average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.^[451]

   In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to
   4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460
   public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities
   and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by
   public and/or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting.
   Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National
   Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public
   Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also
   created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately
   from each other.)

   Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites
   are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogger, eBay, and Craigslist.^[452]

   Well-known newspapers are The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall
   Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the
   years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing
   newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided
   by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for
   their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the
   newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such
   as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of
   newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a
   situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major
   cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream
   daily paper(s), for example, New York City's Village Voice or Los
   Angeles' L.A. Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may
   also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local
   industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.

   In Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue behind English,
   more than 800 publications are published.^[453]^[454]

Cinema

   The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California

   The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New
   York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw
   the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York,
   and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development
   in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film
   industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, California.

   Director D. W. Griffith was central to the development of film grammar
   and Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited as the
   greatest film of all time.^[455]^[456] American screen actors like John
   Wayne and Marilyn Monroe have become iconic figures, while
   producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film
   and movie merchandising. Hollywood is also one of the leaders in motion
   picture production.^[457]

Comics

   Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American
   comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the
   quintessential comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an
   American icon.^[458] Additional comic book publishers include; Marvel
   Comics, created in 1939, Image Comics, created in 1992, Dark Horse
   Comics, created in 1986, and numerous small press comic book companies.
   In celebration of the industry's success, annual comic conventions take
   place at The San Diego Comic-Con International, which has an attendance
   of over 130,000 visitors.

Music

   The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply
   influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European
   traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now
   known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular
   genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as
   Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country
   music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.^[459]

   Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock
   and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to
   become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led
   the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop
   and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson,
   and Madonna have become global celebrities.^[459]

Literature, philosophy, and the arts

   Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Visual art of
   the United States and American classical music
   Mark Twain, American author and humorist

   In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took
   most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne,
   Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive
   American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain
   and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half;
   Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now
   recognized as an essential American poet.^[460] A work seen as
   capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and
   character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The
   Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The
   Great Gatsby (1925)—may be dubbed the "Great American Novel".^[461]

   Eleven U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most
   recently Toni Morrison in 1993. William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway
   are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th
   century.^[462] Popular literary genres such as the Western and
   hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat
   Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have
   postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don
   DeLillo.

   The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson,
   established the first major American philosophical movement. After the
   Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey
   were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the
   work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky,
   brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical
   academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political
   philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental
   tradition in American philosophical academia. Globally influential
   Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and
   Thomas Sowell have transcended discipline to impact various fields in
   social and political philosophy.^[463]^[464]

   In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century
   movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings
   of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New
   York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public
   and transformed the U.S. art scene.^[465] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden
   Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles.
   Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson
   Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy
   Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of
   modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American
   architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.
   Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district

   One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P.
   T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex
   in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular
   musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th
   century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of
   musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and
   Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill
   won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists
   include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward
   Albee, and August Wilson.

   Though little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s
   established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical
   tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage
   created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron
   Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and
   classical music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped
   create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were
   leaders in 20th-century ballet. Americans have long been important in
   the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers
   including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.

Food

   Main article: Cuisine of the United States
   Apple pie is a food synonymous with American culture.

   Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western
   countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain. Traditional American
   cuisine uses indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes,
   sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, which were consumed by
   Native Americans and early European settlers.^[466]

   Slow-cooked pork and beef barbecue, crab cakes, potato chips, and
   chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American foods. Soul food,
   developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many
   African Americans elsewhere. Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana
   Creole, Cajun, and Tex-Mex are regionally important. The confectionery
   industry in the United States includes The Hershey Company, the largest
   chocolate manufacturer in North America. In addition, Frito-Lay, a
   subsidiary of PepsiCo, is the largest globally distributed snack food
   company in the world. The United States has a vast breakfast cereal
   industry that includes brands such as Kellogg's and General Mills.

   Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza,
   hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants.
   French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta
   dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.^[467]
   Americans generally prefer coffee to tea. Marketing by U.S. industries
   is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous
   breakfast beverages.^[468]^[469]

   The American fast food industry, the world's largest, pioneered the
   drive-through format in the 1930s. Fast food consumption has sparked
   health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake
   rose 24%;^[467] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with
   what public health officials call the American "obesity
   epidemic".^[470] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and
   sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric
   intake.^[471]

Sports

   Main article: Sports in the United States
   Swimmer Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all
   time.

   While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices,
   basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and cheerleading
   are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other
   countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native
   Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.^[472] The Iroquois
   field their own separate national team, the Iroquois Nationals, in
   recognition of the confederacy's creation of lacrosse. Eight Olympic
   Games have taken place in the United States. The United States has won
   2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country,
   and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind
   Norway.^[473]

   The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69
   billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle
   East, and Africa combined.^[474] Baseball has been regarded as the
   national sport since the late 19th century, while American football is
   now by several measures the most popular spectator sport.^[475]
   Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading
   professional team sports. These four major sports, when played
   professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping,
   times of the year. College football and basketball attract large
   audiences.^[476] Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched
   individual sports,^[477] but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto
   racing, particularly NASCAR.^[478] In the 21st century, televised mixed
   martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular
   viewers.^[479]^[480] While soccer is less popular in the United States
   than in many other nations, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup,
   the men's national soccer team has been to the past six World Cups and
   the women are first in the women's world rankings.

       ushered in the zenith of U.S. power in what came to be called the
       American Century, as Leffler 2010, p. 67, indicates: "Truman
       presided over the greatest military and economic power the world
       had ever known. War production had lifted the United States out of
       the Great Depression and had inaugurated an era of unimagined
       prosperity. Gross national product increased by 60 percent during
       the war, total earnings by 50 percent. Despite social unrest, labor
       agitation, racial conflict, and teenage vandalism, Americans had
       more discretionary income than ever before. Simultaneously, the
       U.S. government had built up the greatest war machine in human
       history. By the end of 1942, the United States was producing more
       arms than all the Axis states combined, and, in 1943, it made
       almost three times more armaments than did the Soviet Union. In
       1945, the United States had two-thirds of the world's gold
       reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its
       shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP
       was three times that of the Soviet Union and more than five times
       that of Britain. It was also nearing completion of the atomic bomb,
       a technological and production feat of huge costs and proportions."
