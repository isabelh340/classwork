United States Census

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The Bureau of the Census is part of the United States Department of
   Commerce.

   The United States Census is a decennial census mandated by Article I,
   Section 2 of the United States Constitution, which states:
   "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
   several States ... according to their respective Numbers ... . The
   actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first
   Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every
   subsequent Term of ten Years."^[1]^[2] The United States Census Bureau
   (officially the Bureau of the Census, as defined in Title 13 U.S.C. §
   11) is responsible for the United States Census.

   The first census after the American Revolution was taken in 1790, under
   Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson; there have been 22 federal
   censuses since that time.^[2] The current national census was held in
   2010 and the next census is scheduled for 2020 and much of it will be
   done using the internet.^[3] For years between the decennial censuses,
   the Census Bureau issues estimates made using surveys and statistical
   models, in particular, the American Community Survey.

   Title 13 of the United States Code governs how the Census is conducted
   and how its data is handled. Information is confidential as per 13
   U.S.C. § 9. Refusing or neglecting to answer the census is punishable
   by fines of $100, for a property or business agent to fail to provide
   correct names for the census is punishable by fines of $500, and for a
   business agent to provide false answers for the census is punishable by
   fines of $10,000, pursuant to 13 U.S.C. § 221-224.

   The United States Census is a population census, which is distinct from
   the U.S. Census of Agriculture, which is no longer the responsibility
   of the Census Bureau. It is also distinct from local censuses conducted
   by some states or local jurisdictions.

Procedure[edit]

   Transcription of census data using a keyboard punch circa 1940

   Decennial U.S. Census figures are based on actual counts of persons
   dwelling in U.S. residential structures. They include citizens,
   non-citizen legal residents, non-citizen long-term visitors and illegal
   immigrants. The Census Bureau bases its decision about whom to count on
   the concept of usual residence. Usual residence, a principle
   established by the Census Act of 1790, is defined as the place a person
   lives and sleeps most of the time. The Census Bureau uses special
   procedures to ensure that those without conventional housing are
   counted; however, data from these operations are not considered as
   accurate as data obtained from traditional procedures.^[4]

   The Census also uses hot deck imputation to assign data to housing
   units where occupation status is unknown. This practice has effects
   across many areas, but is seen by some as controversial^[5] because it
   may increase representation for reliably Democratic
   districts.^[citation needed] However, the practice was ruled
   constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in Utah v. Evans.

   Certain American citizens living overseas are specifically excluded
   from being counted in the census even though they may vote. Only
   Americans living abroad who are "Federal employees (military and
   civilian) and their dependents living overseas with them" are counted.
   "Private U.S. citizens living abroad who are not affiliated with the
   Federal government (either as employees or their dependents) will not
   be included in the overseas counts. These overseas counts are used
   solely for reapportioning seats in the U. S. House of
   Representatives."^[6]

Controversy[edit]

   The census results determine how many seats each U.S. state receives in
   the House of Representatives, and how many Electoral College votes each
   state is allocated for the purpose of electing the President. As a
   consequence, disagreements about census procedure are sometimes highly
   politicized. For example, the practice of including non-citizens in the
   official census figures is controversial.^[citation needed]

   Disadvantaged minorities are statistically more likely to be
   undercounted. For example, the Census Bureau estimates that in 1970
   over six percent of blacks went uncounted, whereas only around two
   percent of whites went uncounted. Democrats often argue that modern
   sampling techniques should be used so that more accurate and complete
   data can be inferred. Republicans often argue against such sampling
   techniques, stating the U.S. Constitution requires an "actual
   enumeration" for apportionment of House seats, and that political
   appointees would be tempted to manipulate the sampling formulas.^[7]

   Groups like the Prison Policy Initiative assert that the census
   practice of counting prisoners as residents of prisons, not their
   pre-incarceration addresses, leads to misleading information about
   racial demographics and population numbers.^[8]

History[edit]

   Censuses had been taken prior to the Constitution's ratification; in
   the early 17th century, a census was taken in Virginia, and people were
   counted in nearly all of the British colonies that became the United
   States.

   Throughout the years, the country's needs and interests became more
   complex. This meant that statistics were needed to help people
   understand what was happening and have a basis for planning. The
   content of the decennial census changed accordingly. In 1810, the first
   inquiry on manufactures, quantity and value of products occurred; in
   1840, inquiries on fisheries were added; and in 1850, the census
   included inquiries on social issues, such as taxation, churches,
   pauperism, and crime. The censuses also spread geographically, to new
   states and territories added to the Union, as well as to other areas
   under U.S. sovereignty or jurisdiction. There were so many more
   inquiries of all kinds in the census of 1880 that almost a full decade
   was needed to publish all the results. In response to this, the census
   was mechanized in 1890, with tabulating machines made by Herman
   Hollerith. This reduced the processing time to two and a half
   years.^[9]

   For the first six censuses (1790–1840), enumerators recorded only the
   names of the heads of household and a general demographic accounting of
   the remaining members of the household. Beginning in 1850, all members
   of the household were named on the census. The first slave schedules
   were also completed in 1850, with the second (and last) in 1860.
   Censuses of the late 19th century also included agricultural and
   industrial schedules to gauge the productivity of the nation's economy.
   Mortality schedules (taken between 1850 and 1880) captured a snapshot
   of life spans and causes of death throughout the country.

   The first nine censuses (1790–1870) were not managed by the Executive
   branch, but by the Judicial branch. The United States federal court
   districts assigned U.S. marshals, who hired assistant marshals to
   conduct the actual enumeration. The census enumerators were typically
   from the village or neighbourhood and often knew the residents. Before
   enabling self-identification on the censuses, the US Census Bureau
   relied on local people to have some knowledge of residents. Racial
   classification was made by the census enumerator in these decades,
   rather than by the individual.

   6 1840 June 1, 1840 17,069,453 The census estimated the population of
   the United States at 17,100,000. The results were tabulated by 28
   clerks in the Bureau of the Census.
   7 1850 June 1, 1850 23,191,876 The 1850 census was a landmark year in
   American census-taking. It was the first year in which the census
   bureau attempted to record every member of every household, including
   women, children and slaves. Accordingly, the first slave schedules were
   produced in 1850. Prior to 1850, census records had only recorded the
   name of the head of the household and tabulated the other household
   members within given age groups.
   8 1860 June 1, 1860 31,443,321 The results were tabulated by 184 clerks
   in the Bureau of the Census.
   This was the first census where the American Indians officially were
   counted, but only those who had 'renounced tribal rules'. The figure
   for the nation was 40,000.
   9 1870 June 1, 1870 39,818,449
   10 1880 June 1, 1880 50,189,209 This was the first census that
   permitted women to be enumerators.
   11 1890 June 2, 1890
   ^[n 1] 62,947,714 Because it was believed that the frontier region of
   the United States no longer existed, the tracking of westward migration
   was not tabulated in the 1890 census.^[10] This trend prompted
   Frederick Jackson Turner to develop his milestone Frontier Thesis.

   The 1890 census was the first to be compiled on a tabulating machine,
   developed by Herman Hollerith.^[11] The introduction of this technology
   reduced the time taken to tabulate the census from seven years for the
   1880 census to two and a half years for the 1890 census. The total
   population of 62,622,250 was announced after only six weeks of
   processing. The public reaction to this tabulation was disbelief, as it
   was widely believed that the "right answer" was at least 75,000,000.
   This census is also notable for the fact it is one of only three for
   which the original data is no longer available. Almost all the
   population schedules were destroyed following a fire in 1921.

   individuals' data has now been released to the public (by the 72-year
   rule).
   17 1950 April 1, 1950 150,697,361 Because of the 72-year rule, this

   19 1970 April 1, 1970 203,302,031 This was the first census that
   recorded a population exceeding 200 million. Because of the 72-year
   rule, this census will be available for public inspection on April 1,
   2042.
   20 1980 April 1, 1980 226,545,805 Because of the 72-year rule, this

   23 2010 April 1, 2010 308,745,538 For the first time since 1940, the
   2010 Census is a short-form-only census, as the decennial long form has
   been replaced by the American Community Survey.
   This was the first census that recorded a population exceeding 300
   million. Because of the 72-year rule, this census will be available for
   public inspection on April 1, 2082.

Respondent confidentiality[edit]

   The principal purpose of the census is to divide the house seats by
   population. In addition, collected data is used in aggregate for
   statistical purposes.^[12] Replies are obtained from individuals and
   establishments only to enable the compilation of such general
   statistics. The confidentiality of these replies is very important. By
   law, no one— neither the census takers nor any other Census Bureau
   employee— is permitted to reveal identifiable information about any
   person, household, or business. Without such protections, those living
   illegally in the United States or hiding from the government would be
   deterred from submitting census data.

   By law (92 Stat. 915, Public Law 95-416, enacted on October 5, 1978),
   individual census records are sealed for 72 years^[13] prohibiting the
   release of personal information during individuals' lifetimes. The
   individual census data most recently released to the public is the 1940
   census, released on April 2, 2012. Aggregate census data are released
   when available.

Historical FBI use of data[edit]

   Under the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI), using primarily census records, compiled
   (1939–1941) the Custodial Detention Index ("CDI") on citizens, enemy
   aliens, and foreign nationals, who might be dangerous. The Second War
   Powers Act of 1941 repealed the legal protection of confidential census
   data, which was not restored until 1947. This information facilitated
   the internment of Japanese-Americans, following the Japanese attack on
   the U.S. at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the internment of
   Italian- and German-Americans following the United States' entry into
   World War II.^[14]^[15]

   In 1980, four FBI agents went to the Census Bureau's Colorado Springs
   office with warrants to seize Census documents, but were forced to
   leave with nothing. Courts upheld that no agency, including the FBI,
   has access to Census data.^[16]

Data analysis[edit]

   The census records and data specific to individual respondents are not
   available to the public until 72 years after a given census was taken,
   but aggregate statistical data derived from the census are released as
   soon as they are available. The 72-year rule is not law, but a rule
   posed by Roy V. Peel, Census Bureau Director, in a letter to Wayne C.
   Grover, Archivist, on August 26, 1952.^[17] Every census up to and
   including 1940 is currently available to the public and can be viewed
   on microfilm released by the National Archives and Records
   Administration, the official keeper of archived federal census records.
   Complete online census records can be accessed for no cost from
   National Archives facilities and many libraries,^[18] and a growing
   portion of the census is freely available from non-commercial online
   sources.^[19]^[20]^[21]

   Census microdata for research purposes are available for censuses from
   1850 forward through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
   (IPUMS), and scanned copies of each of the decennial census
   questionnaires are available online from many websites. Computerized
   aggregate data describing the characteristics of small geographic areas
   for the entire period from 1790 to 2010 are available from the National
   Historical Geographic Information System.

Regions and divisions[edit]

   US Census Bureau Population Regions

   The bureau recognizes four census regions within the United States and
   further organizes them into nine divisions. These regions are groupings
   of states that subdivide the United States for the presentation of
   data. They should not be construed as necessarily being thus grouped
   owing to any geographical, historical, or cultural bonds.
   US Census Regions
   Region 1: Northeast Region 2: Midwest Region 3: South Region 4: West
     * Division 1: New England
     * Division 2: Mid-Atlantic

     * Division 3: East North Central
