Educational attainment in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This graph shows the educational attainment since 1940.^[1]

   The educational attainment of the U.S. population is similar to that of
   many other industrialized countries with the vast majority of the
   population having completed secondary education and a rising number of
   college graduates that outnumber high school dropouts. As a whole, the
   population of the United States is spending more years in formal
   educational programs. As with income, levels differ by race, age,
   household configuration and geography.^[2]

   Overall the households and demographics featuring the highest
   educational attainment in the United States are also among those with
   the highest household income and wealth. Thus, while the population as
   a whole is proceeding further in formal educational programs, income
   and educational attainment remain highly correlated.^[2]

General attainment of degrees/diplomas[edit]

   CAPTION: Educational attainment in the United States, Age 25 and Over
   (2013)^[3]

   Doctorate                                                 1.68%

   In 2005, the proportion of the population having finished high school
   and the percentage of those having earned bachelor's degrees remained
   at an all-time high, while the growth in both categories has slowed
   down over the past two decades. The vast majority of the population,
   85.2%, had finished high school and nearly a quarter, 22%, had earned a
   Bachelor's degree. The percentage of both college and high school
   graduates has continued to increase since 2000.^[2]

   Since 1983 the percentage of people graduating from high school has
   increased from 85% to 88%. The greatest increases in educational
   attainment were documented in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. In the 1950s and
   much of the 1960s high school graduates constituted about 50% of those
   considered adults (25 and above). For young adults aged between 25 and
   29, the percentage of high school graduates was roughly 50% in 1950
   versus 90% today.^[2]

Gender[edit]

   For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational
   achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender
   has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and
   1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic
   performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and
   science.^[4]
   Achievement gaps between boys and girls in the United States are more
   pronounced in reading and writing than in math and science.

   Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls
   outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades
   across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring
   higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the
   higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology,
   engineering, and math).^[4]

Gender gap in literacy[edit]

   Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing.
   Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students
   continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading
   Assessment measured by the US Department of Education, the gap between
   boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14
   points behind girls during their 12th grade year.^[5] On the 2008 test,
   female students continued to have higher average reading scores than
   male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th
   graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap
   between males and females.^[5]

   On the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17
   points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21
   points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high
   school.^[6] In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing
   Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students,
   though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average
   score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1
   point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males
   by 18 points as opposed to 21 points in 2002.^[7]

   All of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point
   scale.^[5]^[6]^[7]

Graduation rates[edit]

   Overall, women have surpassed men in terms of completing secondary and
   post-secondary education with the gender gap almost completely
   reversed. In 2006, 10.3% of males and 8.3% of females dropped out of
   high school.^[8] In 2005/2006, women earned 62% of Associate's degrees,
   58% of Bachelor's degrees, 60.0% of Master's degrees, and 48.9% of
   Doctorates.^[9]

   According to recent data, 55 percent of college students are females
   and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males
   enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female
   students rose by 27 percent.^[10] Males are enrolling in college in
   greater numbers than ever before, yet less than two-thirds of them are
   graduating with a bachelor’s degree. The numbers of both men and women
   receiving a bachelor’s degree have increased significantly, but the
   increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate
   for males.^[11]

   In 2007, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 18,423,000
   males over the age of 18 held a bachelor’s degree, while 20,501,000
   females over the age 18 held one. In addition, fewer males held
   master’s degrees: 6,472,000 males compared to 7,283,000 females.
   However, more men held professional and doctoral degrees than women.
   2,033,000 males held professional degrees compared to 1,079,000, and
   1,678,000 males had received a doctoral degree compared to 817,000
   females.^[12]

   In 2016/2017, women are projected to earn 64.2% of Associate's degrees,
   59.9% of Bachelor's degrees, 62.9% of Master's degrees, and 55.5% of
   Doctorates.^[13]

Race[edit]

   Further information: Racial achievement gap in the United States

   While the educational attainment of all races increased during the
   1990s, with the gap between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites
   decreasing, severe differences between the races remain, especially
   among those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Asian Americans had the
   highest educational attainment of any race, followed by whites who had
   a higher percentage of high school graduates but a lower percentage of
   college graduates. In 2003 the US Census Bureau reported African
   Americans with the third-highest percentage of bachelor degrees.
   Persons identifying as Hispanic or Latino, without regard to race, had
   the lowest educational attainment. The gap was the largest between
   foreign-born Asian Americans, over half (50.1%) of whom had a
   bachelor's degree or higher and foreign-born Hispanics, 9.8% of whom
   had a four-year college degree.^[2]

   Hispanics and Latinos also trailed far behind in terms of graduating
   from high school; it was the only major group for which high school
   graduates constituted less than 80% of the population. This large
   inequality might partially be explained thorough the influx of
   uneducated foreign-born Hispanic Americans who had not been offered the
   chance to complete secondary education in their home country and who
   had not completed secondary education in the United States.

   Overall nearly half (49.8%) of Asian Americans, nearly a third (30%) of
   non-Hispanic Whites, 17.3% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and just over a
   tenth (11.4%) of Hispanics or Latinos had a four-year college degree.
   The same differences decrease significantly at the high school level
   with 89.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 87.6% of Asian Americans, 80.0% of
   African Americans, and only 57% of Hispanics or Latinos having
   graduated from high school.^[2]

   The Racial achievement gap in the United States refers to these
   educational disparities between minority students and Caucasian
   students. Evidence of the racial achievement gap remains present today
   because not all groups of students are advancing at the same rates. The
   racial achievement gap has many individual and economic implications
   and there have been many efforts in education reform to narrow this
   gap.

Foreign born & Immigrants[edit]

   The difference among races and cultures, both native and foreign born,
   in regard to those who have earned a Bachelor's degree or higher.^[2]

   A trend becomes visible when comparing the foreign-born to the
   native-born populace of some races. Foreign-born Asian, European, and
   African immigrants had a higher educational attainment in terms of
   having earned a four-year college degree than their native-born
   counterparts. According to the U.S census about 43.8 percent of African
   immigrants achieved the most college degrees, compared to 42.5 percent
   of Asian-Americans, 28.9 percent for immigrants from Europe, Russia and
   Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a
   whole.^[14]^[15]^[16]

   The opposite is true on the high school level and among Hispanics,
   where the dramatically lower educational attainment of the foreign-born
   population decreased the educational attainment of the general
   Hispanophone populace, statistically.^[2]

     The percentage of the foreign born with a high school diploma (67
     percent) was dramatically lower than that of the native population
     (88 percent), but paradoxically, the percentage with a bachelor's
     degree was the same (27 percent)... At the bachelor's level, foreign
     born Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites fared better than their native
     counterparts. Foreign-born Hispanics, in contrast, had a smaller
     proportion with a bachelor's degree than the native population...
     The low educational attainment of foreign-born Hispanics, who
     compose more than 50 percent of the Hispanic population, contributes
     to the low attainment levels of the entire Hispanic population.
     — US Census Bureau, 2003

   Only among Hispanics and Latinos was the proportion of college
   graduates larger among the native born population. In the general
   population the proportion of persons with a bachelor's degree or higher
   was the same among the foreign-born and native-born population (27.2%).
   As stated above fewer foreign born Americans completed high school than
   native born Americans. Overall 87.5% of the native born population had
   graduated from high school, versus 67.2%. Among whites the difference
   was three percentage points, the same as for African Americans. Among
   Asian Americans the difference was five percentage points. It was
   thirty percentage points among Hispanics or Latinos.^[2]

   African immigrants have been the most highly educated group in the
   United States since the 1990s.^[17]^[18] This phenomenon is related to
   the large "brain drain" in Africa.^[19]

Income[edit]

   Chart of unemployment and salary based on education attainment Data are
   for persons age 25 and over. Earnings are for full-time wage and salary
   workers

   Educational attainment is strongly correlated with income in the United
   States. Although the incomes of both men and women are associated with
   higher educational attainment (higher incomes for higher educational
   attainment), large income gaps linked to race and gender remained at
   each educational level. In 2003, average incomes ranged from $13,459
   for a male high-school dropout to $90,761 for a male with an advanced
   degree. The most significant average income difference was between
   those who had some college education or an Associates degree and those
   who had a Bachelor's degree. While those with some college averaged
   $31,046, those with a Bachelor's degree averaged $51,194, over $20,000
   (64.9%) a year more.^[2]

   The second most dramatic difference in average income was between those
   with a Bachelor's degree with $51,940 and those with an advanced degree
   who made $72,824, roughly $21,000 (42.2%) more. The least significant
   difference was between those who had graduated from high school and
   those who had either some college or an Associates degree. Here the
   difference was a mere $3,766 or 13.8%. The difference between those
   with a high school diploma ($30,000) and those who did not complete
   high school ($18,826) was $8,454 or 45%. Overall, the income in the
   United States for all sexes, races and levels of educational attainment
   was $36,308 annually.^[2]

   Even though African immigrants have higher educational attainment rates
   than any other group, they were the hardest hit during the most recent
   recession beginning in 2007.^[15]^[20]^[21]^[22] This shows that race
   and/or ethnicity may play a role in income levels and job
   selection.^[20]

   Income by education and gender.

   The change in median personal and household income since 1991 also
   varied greatly with educational attainment. While both the overall
   median personal and household income increased since 1991, this
   increase did not take place on all levels of educational attainment.
   The overall income increased over the course of the 1990s, reaching its
   high in 1999, but has been decreasing ever since. In 1991 the median
   household income in the US was $40,873 in 2003 dollars, while the
   median household income in 2003 was $45,016. In 1999, however, the
   median household income was $46,236, 2.7% higher than today. While this
   trend held true for all levels of educational attainment the extent of
   chorinical fluctuations in income were greatly influenced by
   educational attainment.^[23]^[24]

   Overall the median household and personal income decreased for those
   with more than a 9th grade education but less than a four-year college
   degree since 1991. In other words, the median household income
   decreased for households and individuals at the high school drop-outs
   and graduate, some-college, and an Associates degree level. Income did,
   however, increase for those with a Bachelor's degree or more. The
   following table shows the median household income according to the
   educational attainment of the householder. All data is in 2003 dollars
   and only applies to householders whose householder is aged twenty-five
   or older. The highest and lowest points of the median household income

   Income by education and race.

   Among the races, educational attainment retains its dramatic effect on
   average income which varies significantly at each educational level.
   European Americans (White Americans) had the highest average income at
   every level of educational attainment. However, the proportion of those
   having college degrees is greater among Asian Americans than among
   non-Hispanic whites, and the overall highest average income is found
   among Asians. All races except Whites ranked last on at least one level
   with African Americans ranking last on the non-high school, high school
   and advanced degree level.^[2]

   Asians were second highest on the college graduate level and had the
   highest overall income among the general population. They also had the
   lowest average annual income for those with some college education or
   an Associates degree. Racial income difference were also significant at
   every level of educational attainment with the largest racial
   inequality being between European and African Americans who did not
   complete high school and those with advanced college degrees.^[2]

   Overall European Americans with an advanced degree had the highest
   average annual income with $74,122. Asian Americans had the second
   highest with $72,852. Hispanics and African Americans had the lowest
   annual incomes among those with advanced degrees averaging $67,679 and
   $59,944 annually. The largest racial inequity was between European
   Americans with a Bachelor's degree who made $53,185 than Hispanics who
   made $12,263 or 29.9% less with an average annual income of
   $40,949.^[2]

Occupation[edit]

   The educational attainment of employed civilians age 25 to 64 according
   to occupational field.^[2]

   The educational attainment varied significantly among the different
   types of occupations. The highest occupational attainment was among
   those in the Professional and related fields followed by those
   Business, Management and financial related occupations. The
   professional/managerial fields were the only two occupational fields
   where college graduates with a Bachelor's degree or higher represented
   the majority. Among professional occupations, 99.1% of the population
   graduated from high school, 90.2% had some college education or an
   Associates degree and over two thirds, 68.2% had a Bachelor's degree or
   higher.^[2]

   Business and managerial occupations were second with 97.8% having
   graduated from high school, 79.5% having some college or an associates
   degree and just over half, 53.4% having a Bachelor's degree or higher.
   While nearly all employment fields feature a population where over 80%
   had graduated from high school with over a third having some college
   education or an Associates degree, the fields relating to agriculture,
   construction, manufacturing, and transportation did not. These, often
   described as blue collar, fields featured a labor force where less than
   a tenth of the population had a Bachelor's degree or higher, less than
   half had some college or an Associates, and less than 80% had graduated
   from high school.^[2]

   Overall the least educated occupational field was agriculture, ranking
   dead last on all educational levels. Here only 55.4% had graduated from
   high school, roughly one fifth (20.8%) had some college education or an
   Associates degree and only 6.8% had a Bachelor's degree or higher.
   While the largest occupational field, that consisting of professionals
   and relating occupations was also the largest field, the fields with
   lower educational attainment combined were larger than the professional
   and managerial fields combined. Overall 38.02% were employed in the
   professional and managerial fields while 61.89% were employed in the
   other white and blue collar fields were those with a Bachelor's degree
   or higher constituted less than a third of the work force.^[2]
   The percent of the labor force in the Professional/Managerial and
   relating occupations, white collar occupations and blue collar
   occupations.^[2]

Geography[edit]

   Educational attainment among the population aged 25 and above varied
   rather slightly with geography region. The population of the
   Northeastern United States, which had the smallest population of any
   region with thirty-six million residents, had the highest percentage of
   high-school and college graduates. The western United States had the
   highest percentage of those with some college or an Associates degree
   and ranked second for college graduates. The South which had by far the
   largest population with roughly sixty-six million people had the lowest
   educational attainment at every level.^[2]

   The proportion of high school graduates was the largest in the Midwest
   while the proportion of those with some college or an Associates degree
   was the second and that of those with a Bachelor's degree or higher was
   the third largest of any region.

Social class and education[edit]

   & Bacon. The upper middle class may also be referred to as
   "Professional class" Ehrenreich, B. (1989). The Inner Life of the
   Middle Class. NY, NY: Harper-Colins.

   Educational attainment is one of the primary indicators of social class
   in the United States.^[25] While the American social class system is a
   vaguely defined concept with many contradicting theories,^[26]^[27]
   educational attainment emerges as one of the top assessments of social
   class. Not only is a high educational attainment a status symbol by
   itself, but it is also very closely related to the other two main
   indicators of social class: occupation and income. A graduate degree
   and the roughly seven to eight years of post-secondary education serve
   as the main requirement for entering the "professions" and becoming
   part of the professional middle class.^[25]

   Education is a major key in becoming a more privileged member of the
   American middle class.^[25]^[27] Overall, educational attainment is the
   main entrance barrier into more privileged parts of the middle class as
   it is not only of high value but is also the requirement for becoming a
   professional and earning the corresponding income.^[25] This
   corresponding income is typically significantly higher than that of
   someone without this higher level of educational attainment in the
   United States. Exceptions include some entrepreneurs who can rank
   anywhere in the class system but are usually not referred to as
   professional middle class unless they are of the professions.

   In the United States. it also important to differentiate between the
   statistical middle class, often defined as consisting of those who are
   neither rich nor poor, and the professional middle class. Recent
   research has shown that not only is the statistical middle of society
   (those with income roughly 80% to 120% of the national median or
   members of the mid-quintile) no longer able to afford the lifestyle
   indicative of the middle class,^[28] but there also seems to be a
   widening income gap in between those who may be described as being
   middle class.

   Education is not only the main requirement for becoming a member of the
   professional middle class, it is also key to a comfortable lifestyle
   and economic security.^[25] Those in the statistical middle may have to
   fear lay-offs and cost-cutting downsizing as well as out-sourcing,
   while some of those in the professional middle class are less subject
   to economic fluctuations and are more likely to enjoy upper-middle
   range incomes even in the face of recessions. Increasingly however even
   the professional middle class is facing lay-offs and job elimination
   due to downsizing and replacement of full-time workers with part-time
   workers—this is particularly evident in colleges and universities
   where, by 2009, half of the faculty were part-time; another 25% were
   full-time but with short-term contracts, thus showing that advanced
   education is not necessarily associated with high salaries and economic
   stability.^[29]

Bourdieu and cultural capital[edit]

   Many scholars have studied educational attainment in the US as a form
   of social reproduction and stratification. In 1977, Pierre Bourdieu
   presented the idea that education leads to social reproduction and a
   stratified society by honoring the cultural capital of elite classes.
   Students who possess the valued cultural capital, according to
   Bourdieu, are rewarded with high academic achievement.^[30]

   When elite class members enter the workforce, they are channeled into
   high paying jobs and powerful positions within society, while those who
   did not achieve the same level of academic success fall into
   subordinate occupations and status levels. By rewarding the desired
   cultural capital with high academic achievement, upper classes are able
   and prepared to reach higher levels of educational attainment. Members
   of the working class, on the other hand, are not rewarded for their
   cultural capital in schools, and are instead socialized for working
   class jobs.

Lareau and concerted cultivation[edit]

   Annette Lareau also addresses the factors that lead to social
   stratification in educational attainment. Lareau's idea of concerted
   cultivation refers to an active involvement of parents in a child's
   learning and development experiences by creating and controlling
   organized activities for their children. According to Lareau,
   middle-class parents engage in concerted cultivation to teach their
   children, while lower- and working-class parents do not. Laureau
   further explains that schools firmly encourage and expect parents to
   use concerted cultivation as a child-rearing strategy.^[31]

   The child-rearing practices of lower- and working-class families thus
   do not comply with the standards of educational institutions. As a
   result, lower- and working-class students develop a sense of "distance,
   distrust, and constraint" in educational institutions, while children
   of middle-class families gain a sense of entitlement. These differences
   in child-rearing practices lead to children of lower- and working-class
   families to lack the necessary life skills that the children of the
   middle class possess, further isolating them from educational
   opportunities. In the United States, education attainment typically is
   viewed as a sign of social status.

Collins and credentialism[edit]

   Randall Collins contributed the idea of credentialism to the study of
   class-based differences in educational attainment. Collins maintains
   that public schools are socializing institutions that teach and reward
   middle-class values of competition and achievement. In this view,
   elites are selectively separated from other students and placed into
   prestigious schools and colleges, where they are trained to hold
   positions of power.^[32]

   By teaching middle-class culture through the public education system,
   the elite class ensures a monopoly over positions of power, while
   others acquire the credentials to compete in a subordinate job market
   and economy. In this way, schools of medicine, law, and elite
   institutions have remained closed to members of lower classes.
