   Remarks by FDR in 1944 at Union Station, thanking government workers
   for helping win the war

   In the United States, the federal civil service was established in
   1871. The Federal Civil Service is defined as "all appointive positions
   in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government
   of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services." (5
   U.S.C. § 2101).^[1] In the early 19th century, positions in the federal
   government were held at the pleasure of the president—a person could be
   fired at any time. The spoils system meant that jobs were used to
   support the American political parties, though this was gradually
   changed by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 and
   subsequent laws. By 1909, almost two-thirds of the U.S. federal
   workforce was appointed based on merit, that is, qualifications
   measured by tests. Certain senior civil service positions, including
   some heads of diplomatic missions and executive agencies are filled by
   political appointees. Under the Hatch Act of 1939, civil servants are
   not allowed to engage in political activities while performing their
   duties.^[2]

   According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as of December
   2011, there were approximately 2.79 million civil servants (civilian,
   i.e. non-uniformed) employed by the US Government.^[3]^[4]^[5] (This
   includes executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.
   This also includes more than 600,000 United States Postal workers.)

   The U.S. civil service includes the Competitive service and the
   Excepted service. The majority of civil service appointments in the
   U.S. are made under the Competitive Service, but certain categories in
   the Diplomatic Service, the FBI, and other National Security positions
   are made under the Excepted Service. (U.S. Code Title V)

   U.S. state and local government entities often have competitive civil
   service systems that are modeled on the national system, in varying
   degrees.

Federal agencies[edit]

   Main article: List of United States federal agencies

   Employees in the civil services work under one of the independent
   agencies or one of the 15 executive departments.

   In addition to departments, there are a number of staff organizations
   grouped into the Executive Office of the President. These include the
   White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of
   Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of
   the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control
   Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

   There are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal
   Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the
   Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development
   (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations such as
   the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National
   Railroad Passenger Corporation.^[6]

   As of January 2009, the Federal Government, excluding the Postal
   Service and soldiers, employed about 2.0 million civilian workers. The
   Federal Government is the nation’s single largest employer. Although
   most federal agencies are based in the Washington, D.C. region, only
   about 16% (or about 288,000) of the federal government workforce is
   employed in this region.^[7]

   There were 456 federal agencies in 2009.^[8]

Pay systems[edit]

   Main articles: General Schedule, Federal Wage System, Senior Executive
   Service

   The pay system of the United States government civil service has
   evolved into a complex set of pay systems that include principally the
   General Schedule (GS) for white-collar employees, Federal Wage System
   (FWS) for blue-collar employees, Senior Executive System (SES) for
   Executive-level employees, Foreign Service Schedule (FS) for members of
   the Foreign Service and more than twelve alternate pay systems that are
   referred to as alternate or experimental pay systems such as the first
   experimental system China Lake Demonstration Project. The current
   system began as the classification act of 1923 and was refined into law
   with the Classification Act of 1949. These acts that provide the
   foundation of the current system have been amended through executive
   orders and through published amendments in the Federal Register that
   sets for approved changes in the regulatory structure of the federal
   pay system. The common goal among all pay systems is to achieve the
   goal of paying equitable salaries to all involved workers regardless of
   system, group or classification. This is referred to as pay equity or
   (“equal pay for equal work”). Select careers in high demand may be
   subject to a special rate table,^[9] which can pay above the standard
   GS tables. These careers include certain engineering disciplines and
   patent examiners.^[10]^[11]

   The General Schedule (GS) includes white collar workers at levels 1
   through 15, most professional, technical, administrative, and clerical
   positions in the federal civil service. The Federal Wage System or Wage
   Grade (WG) schedule includes most federal blue-collar workers. As of
   September 2004^[update], 71% of federal civilian employees were paid
   under the GS; the remaining 29% were paid under other systems such as
   the Federal Wage System for federal blue-collar civilian employees, the
   Senior Executive Service/Senior Level and the Executive Schedule for
   high-ranking federal employees, and the pay schedules for the United
   States Postal Service and the Foreign Service. In addition, some
   federal agencies—such as the United States Securities and Exchange
   Commission, the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit
   Insurance Corporation—have their own unique pay schedules.

   All federal employees in the GS system receive a base pay that is
   adjusted for locality. Locality pay varies, but is at least 10% of base
   salary in all parts of the United States. The following salary ranges
   represent the lowest and highest possible amounts a person can earn,
   without earning over-time pay or receiving a merit-based bonus. Actual
   salary ranges differ (for instance a GS-9, step 1 in rural Arkansas may
   start at $46,625 versus $55,015 in San Jose, California), but all
   salaries lie within the parameters of the following ranges (effective
   January, 2012):^[12]
   Pay grade GS-1 GS-2 GS-3 GS-4 GS-5 GS-6 GS-7 GS-8 GS-9 GS-10 GS-11
   GS-12 GS-13 GS-14 GS-15
   Lowest step (1) $ 17,803 $ 20,017 $ 21,840 $ 24,518 $ 27,531 $ 30,577 $
   33,979 $ 37,631 $ 41,563 $ 45,771 $ 50,287 $ 60,274 $ 71,674 $ 84,697 $
   99,628
   Highest step (10) $ 22,269 $ 25,191 $ 28,392 $ 31,871 $ 35,657 $ 39,748
   $ 44,176 $ 48,917 $ 54,028 $ 59,505 $ 65,371 $ 78,355 $93,175 $110,104
   $129,517

   Nineteen percent of federal employees earned salaries of $100,000 or
   more in 2009. The average federal worker's pay was $71,208 compared
   with $40,331 in the private sector, although under Office of Management
   and Budget Circular A-76, most menial or lower paying jobs have been
   outsourced to private contractors.^[14] In 2010, there were 82,034
   workers, 3.9% of the federal workforce, making more than $150,000
   annually, compared to 7,240 in 2005.^[15] GS salaries are capped by law
   so that they do not exceed the salary for Executive Schedule IV
   positions.^[16] The increase in civil servants making more than
   $150,000 resulted mainly from an increase in Executive Schedule salary
   approved during the Administration of George W. Bush, which raised the
   salary cap for senior GS employees slightly above the $150,000
   threshold.^[17]

   Basic pay rates for Senior Executive Service (i.e. non-Presidentially
   appointed civil servants above GS-15) will range from $119,554 to
   $179,700 in 2012.

US Civil Service Commission[edit]

   Main article: United States Office of Personnel Management

   Public support in the United States for civil service reform
   strengthened following the assassination of President James
   Garfield.^[19] The United States Civil Service Commission was created
   by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which was passed into law on
   January 16, 1883. The commission was created to administer the civil
   service of the United States federal government. The law required
   federal government employees to be selected through competitive exams
   and basis of merit;^[19] it also prevented elected officials and
   political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil
   servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan
   behavior.^[19]^[20] However, the law did not apply to state and
   municipal governments.

   Effective January 1, 1978, the commission was renamed the Office of
   Personnel Management under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 2
   of 1978 (43 F.R. 36037, 92 Stat. 3783) and the Civil Service Reform Act
   of 1978.

   The United States Civil service exams have since been abolished for
   many positions, since statistics show that they do not accurately allow
   hiring of minorities according to the affirmative action
   guidelines.^[21]

Civil Service Reform Act of 1978[edit]

   Main article: Civil Service Reform Act of 1978

   This act abolished the United States Civil Service Commission and
   created the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal
   Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the U.S. Merit Systems Protection
   Board (MSPB). OPM primarily provides management guidance to the various
   agencies of the executive branch and issues regulations that control
   federal human resources. FLRA oversees the rights of federal employees
   to form collective bargaining units (unions) and to engage in
   collective bargaining with agencies. MSPB conducts studies of the
   federal civil service and mainly hears the appeals of federal employees
   who are disciplined or otherwise separated from their positions. This
   act was an effort to replace incompetent officials. ^[22]
