Northwestern United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   See also: Pacific Northwest
   The dark red states are almost always included, while the striped
   states are usually considered part of the Northwestern United States as
   well.

   The Northwestern United States is an informal geographic region of the
   United States. The region consistently includes the states of Oregon,
   Washington, and Idaho—and usually Montana and Wyoming. Some sources
   include southeast Alaska in the Northwest. The related but distinct
   term "Pacific Northwest" generally excludes areas from the Rockies
   eastward.

   The Northwestern United States is a subportion of the Western U.S.
   region (which is, itself, even more ambiguous). In contrast, states
   included in the neighboring regions Southwestern U.S. and Great Plains
   are not simultaneously considered part of both regions.

   Like the southwestern United States, the Northwest definition has moved
   westward over time. The 19th century Northwest (usually termed the "Old
   Northwest") comprised the Northwest Territory and gradually migrated
   across the Midwest to its current definition. The current area includes
   the old Oregon Territory (created in 1848–Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
   and areas in Montana west of the Continental Divide).^[1] The region is
   similar to Federal Region X, which comprises Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
   and Alaska.

   It is home to over 13 million citizens.^[dubious – discuss] Some of the
   fastest growing cities in this region and in the nation include
   Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma, Vancouver, Kennewick, Pasco, Yakima, and
   Boise.

Population[edit]

   Together, these states have a combined population of 13,654,456. The
   largest cities and metropolitan areas in the Northwest are:
