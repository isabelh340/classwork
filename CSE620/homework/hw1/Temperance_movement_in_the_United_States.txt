Early Temperance: 1784-1861[edit]

   In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, various factors
   contributed to an epidemic of alcoholism that went hand-in-hand with
   spousal abuse, family neglect, and chronic unemployment. Americans used
   to drinking lightly alcoholic beverages like cider "from the crack of
   dawn to the crack of dawn" began ingesting far more alcohol as they
   drank more of strong, cheap beverages like rum (in the colonial period)
   and whiskey (in the post-Revolutionary period).^[1] Popular pressure
   for cheap and plentiful alcohol led to relaxed ordinances on alcohol
   sales.

   The Temperance movement sparked to life with Benjamin Rush's 1784
   tract, An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human
   Body and Mind, which judged the excessive use of alcohol injurious to
   physical and psychological health. Apparently influenced by Dr. Rush's
   Inquiry, about 200 farmers in a Connecticut community formed a
   temperance association in 1789 to ban the making of whiskey. Similar
   associations were formed in Virginia in 1800, and New York State in
   1808.^[2] Over the next decade, other temperance organizations were
   formed in eight states, some being state-wide organizations. The young
   movement advocated temperance or levelness rather than abstinence. Many
   leaders of the movement expanded their activities and took positions on
   observance of the Sabbath and other moral issues, and by the early
   1820's political in-fighting had stalled the movement.

   Some leaders persevered in pressing their cause forward. Americans such
   as Lyman Beecher, who was a Connecticut minister, had started to
   lecture his fellow citizens against all use of liquor in 1825. The
   American Temperance Society was formed in 1826 and benefited from a
   renewed interest in religion and morality. Within 12 years it claimed
   more than 8,000 local groups and over 1,500,000 members. By 1839, 18
   temperance journals were being published. Simultaneously, some
   Protestant and Catholic church leaders were beginning to promote
   temperance. The movement split along two lines in the late 1830s:
   between moderates allowing some drinking and radicals demanding total
   abstinence, and between voluntarists relying on moral suasion alone and
   prohibitionists promoting laws to restrict or ban alcohol. Radicals and
   prohibitionists dominated many of the largest temperance organizations
   after the 1830's, and temperance eventually became synonymous with
   prohibition.

   Blacks also had an impact on the Temperance movement in the state of
   Connecticut. Jehiel C. Beman formed the Connecticut State Temperance
   Society of Colored People (CSTSCP) in 1836. In 1842, the CSTSCP joined
   with other groups like itself in other states to form the States
   Delevan Union Temperance Society of Colored People.

   The Civil War dealt the movement a crippling blow. Temperance groups in
   the South were then weaker than their Northern counterparts and too
   voluntarist to gain any statewide prohibition law, and the few
   prohibition laws in the North were repealed by the war's end. Both
   sides in the war made alcohol sales a part of the war effort by taxing
   brewers and distillers to finance much of the conflict. The issue of
   slavery crowded out temperance and temperance groups petered out until
   they found new life in the 1870s.^[3]

Temperance Theatre[edit]

   Temperance birthed an entire genre of theatre. This was first seen in
   1825, as The Forgers, a dramatic poem written by John Blake White,
   premiered at the Charleston Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina. The
   next significant temperance drama to debut was titled "Fifteen Years of
   a Drunkard's Life", written by Douglas Jerrold in 1841. As the movement
   began to grow and prosper, these dramas became more popular among the
   general public. "The Drunkard" by W.H. Smith premiered in 1841 in
   Boston, running for 144 performances before being produced at P.T.
   Barnum's American Museum on lower Broadway. The play was wildly popular
   and is often credited with the entrance of the temperance narrative
   into mainstream American theatre. It continued to be a staple of New
   York's theatre scene all the way until 1875. "The Drunkard" follows the
   typical format of a temperance drama: the main character has an
   alcohol-induced downfall, and he restores his life from disarray once
   he denounces drinking for good at the play's end. Temperance drama
   continued to grow as a genre of theatre, fostered by the advent of the
   railroad as a form of transportation. This enabled theatre companies to
   be much more mobile, traveling from city to city. Temperance drama
   would even reach as far as the West Coast, as David Belasco's
   adaptation of Émile Zola's novel "Drink" premiered at the Baldwin
   Theatre in San Francisco in 1879.

Second Wave Temperance: 1872-1893[edit]

   As Reconstruction came to a close in the 1870s, most white reformers
   grew uninterested in racial equality and invested more energy into
   temperance.^[4] This period produced various temperance organizations
   including the prohibitionist Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU,
   f. 1874) and the voluntarist Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America
   (CTAU, f. 1872). Prohibitionist temperance grew popular in the South as
   it embraced the "Southern" values of racial hierarchy, gender roles,
   and honor.^[5] The national movement enlisted more religious support
   throughout the country, especially from evangelicals.

Temperance education[edit]

   In 1873, the WCTU established a Department of Scientific Temperance
   Instruction in Schools and Colleges, with Mary Hunt as National
   Superintendent. The WCTU was an influential organization with a
   membership of 120,000 by 1879.^[citation needed] Frances Willard led
   the group under the motto "Do Everything" to protect women and
   children. Some of the changes the WCTU sought included property and
   custody rights for women, women's suffrage, raising the age of
   consensual sex, peace arbitration, women's education, and advocacy for
   working rights of women.^[6]

   Because of the correlation between drinking and domestic violence—many
   drunken husbands abused family members—the temperance movement existed
   alongside various women's rights and other movements, including the
   Progressive movement, and often the same activists were involved in
   multiple movements. Many notable voices of the time, ranging from Lucy
   Webb Hayes to Susan B. Anthony, were active in temperance. In Canada,
   Nellie McClung was a longstanding advocate of temperance. As with most
   social movements, there was a gamut of activists running from violent
   (Carrie Nation) to mild (Neal S. Dow).

   The American Temperance University opened in 1893 in the planned town
   of Harriman, Tennessee, which was developed as a community with no
   alcoholic beverages permitted. In its second year of operation the
   institution enrolled 345 students from 20 states. However, it closed in
   1908.

Temperance fountains[edit]

   Main article: Temperance fountain

   Muddied and ill-tasting drinking water encouraged many Americans to
   drink alcohol for health purposes, so temperance groups constructed
   public drinking fountains throughout the United States following the
   Civil War. The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU)'s
   organizing convention of 1874 strongly encouraged its attendees to
   erect the fountains in the places that they had come from. The NWCTU
   advocated public temperance fountains as a means to discourage males
   from entering drinking establishment for refreshment.^[7]

   Cast-stone statues of Hebe were marketed for use in temperance
   fountains. In Tompkins Square (New York City) the James Fountain
   (1881), is a Temperance fountain with the figure of Charity who empties
   her jug of water, aided by a child; it was donated by Daniel Willis
   James and sculpted by Adolf Donndorf. In Washington DC "the" Temperance
   Fountain was donated to the city in 1882 by Temperance crusader Henry
   D. Cogswell. This fountain was one of a series of fountains he designed
   and commissioned in a belief that easy access to cool drinking water
   would keep people from consuming alcohol. Under its stone canopy the
   words "Faith," "Hope," "Charity," and "Temperance" are chiseled. Atop
   this canopy is a life-sized heron, and the centerpiece is a pair of
   entwined heraldic scaly dolphins. Originally, visitors were supposed to
   freely drink ice water flowing from the dolphins' snouts with a brass
   cup attached to the fountain and the overflow was collected by a trough
   for horses, but the city tired of having to replenish the ice in a
   reservoir underneath the base and disconnected the supply pipes.

   Simon Benson, an Oregon lumberman, was a tee-totaler who wanted to
   discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day.
   In 1912, Benson gave the City of Portland USD$10,000 for the
   installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. As of May, 2012,
   these fountains, known as "Benson Bubblers", continue to be used as
   functional public drinking devices in downtown Portland; two Portland
   "Benson Bubbler" locations are Eastbank Esplanade and the corner of
   "3rd and Burnside".^[8]^[9]

Third Wave Temperance: 1893-1933[edit]

   The last wave of temperance in the United States saw the rise of the
   Anti-Saloon League, which successfully pushed for National Prohibition
   from its enactment in 1920 to its repeal in 1933. This heavily
   prohibitionist wave attracted a diverse coalition: doctors, pastors,
   and eugenicists; Klansmen and liberal internationalists; business
   leaders and labor radicals; conservative evangelicals and liberal
   theologians.^[10]

Anti-Saloon League[edit]

   Rev. Howard Hyde Russell founded the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) in 1893.
   Under the leadership of Wayne Wheeler the ASL stressed political
   results and perfected the art of pressure politics. It did not demand
   that politicians change their drinking habits, only their votes in the
   legislature. Other organizations like the Prohibition Party and the
   WCTU soon lost influence to the better-organized and more focused ASL.

   The ASL's motto was "the Church in action against the saloon," and it
   mobilized its religious coalition to pass state (and local) legislation
   (establishing dry states and dry counties).

   By the late nineteenth century, most Protestant denominations and the
   American wing of the Catholic Church supported the movement to legally
   restrict the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. These groups
   believed that alcohol consumption led to corruption, prostitution,
   spousal abuse and other criminal activities. Brewers and distillers
   resisted the reform movement, which threatened to ruin their
   livelihood, and also feared women having the vote, because they
   expected women to vote for prohibition.^[6]

   Energized by the anti-German sentiment during World War I, the ASL
   achieved its main goal of passage on December 18, 1917—the 18th
   Amendment. Upon ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures
   by January 16, 1919, established National Prohibition. (the Amendment
   came into effect on January 16, 1920) Prohibition banned "the
   manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages in the
   United States and its possessions." However, Prohibition did not outlaw
   the purchase or consumption of alcohol products.

Temperance organizations[edit]

   Temperance organizations of the United States played an essential role
   in bringing about ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment of the
   United States Constitution establishing national prohibition of
   alcohol. They included:
     * the American Issue Publishing House
     * the American Temperance Society
     * the Anti-Saloon League
     * the British Women's Temperance Association
     * the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America
     * the Committee of Fifty (1893)
     * the Daughters of Temperance^[11]
     * the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction
     * the Flying Squadron of America
     * the Independent Order of Good Templars
