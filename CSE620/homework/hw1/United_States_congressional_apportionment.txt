United States congressional apportionment

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   United States congressional apportionment is the process by which seats
   in the United States House of Representatives are redistributed amongst
   the 50 states following each constitutionally mandated decennial
   census. Each state is apportioned a number of seats which approximately
   corresponds to its share of the aggregate population of the 50
   states.^[1] However, every state is constitutionally guaranteed at
   least one seat.

Reapportionment[edit]

   The 435 seats of the House grouped by state (post-2010 Census
   reapportionment).
   While citizens of each state are given nearly equal voting power
   through representation in the House, the situation in the Senate is
   significantly different where each state gets two votes no matter how
   large its population may be. A Wyoming voter, therefore, has roughly 66
   times more representation in the Senate than a California voter.
   (Citizens in DC and territories have no voting power in Congress.)

   The number of seats in the House of Representatives is currently set to
   435, and has been since 1913, except for a temporary increase to 437
   after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. Though the actual
   reapportionment will normally occur in respect of a decennial census,
   the law that governs the total number of representatives and the method
   of apportionment to be carried into force at that time can be created
   prior to the census.

   The decennial apportionment also determines the size of each state's
   representation in the U.S. Electoral College—that is, any state's
   number of electors equals the size of its total congressional
   delegation (i.e., House seat(s) plus Senate seats).^[2]

   Federal law requires the Clerk of the House of Representatives to
   notify each state government of its entitled number of seats no later
   than January 25 of the year immediately following the census. After
   seats have been reapportioned, each state determines the boundaries of
   congressional districts—geographical areas within the state of
   approximately equal population—in a process called redistricting.^[3]
   Any citizen of the State can challenge the constitutionality of the
   redistricting in their US district court.^[4]

   Because the deadline for the House Clerk to report the results does not
   occur until the following January, and the states need sufficient time
   to perform the redistricting, the decennial census does not affect the
   elections that are held during that same year. For example, the
   electoral college apportionment during 2000 presidential election was
   still based on the 1990 census results. Likewise, the congressional
   districts and the electoral college during the 2020 general elections
   will still be based on the 2010 census.

Constitutional texts[edit]

   The subject of Congressional apportionment is addressed twice in the
   U.S. Constitution. Initially, the apportionment of House seats was
   guided by two sentences in Article I, Section 2, clause 3:

     Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
     several States which may be included within this Union, according to
     their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the
     whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a
     Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all
     other Persons.

     The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty
     Thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative;…

   Following the end of the Civil War, the first of those provisions was
   superseded by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

     Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States
     according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of
     persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,^[5] But when the
     right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for
     President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives
     in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the
     members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male^[6]
     inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,^[7] and
     citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for
     participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of
     representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the
     number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male
     citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

   The size of the U.S. House of Representatives refers to total number of
   congressional districts (or seats) into which the land area of the
   United States proper has been divided. The number of voting
   representatives is currently set at 435. There are an additional five
   delegates to the House of Representatives. They represent the District
   of Columbia and the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern
   Mariana Islands, which first elected a representative in 2008,^[8] and
   the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico also elects a resident
   commissioner every four years.

Controversy and history[edit]

   Since 1789, when the Federal Government began operating under the
   Constitution, the number of citizens per congressional district has
   risen from an average of 33,000 in 1790 to almost 700,000 as of
   2008^[update]. Prior to the 20th century, the number of representatives
   increased every decade as more states joined the union, and the
   population increased. In 1911, Public Law 62-5 raised the membership of
   the U.S. House to 433 with a provision to add one permanent seat each
   upon the admissions of Arizona and New Mexico as states. As provided,
   membership increased to 435 in 1912.

   In 1921, Congress failed to reapportion the House membership as
   required by the United States Constitution. This failure to reapportion
   may have been politically motivated, as the newly elected Republican
   majority may have feared the effect such a reapportionment would have
   on their future electoral prospects.^[9]^[10] Then in 1929 Congress
   (Republican control of both houses of congress and the presidency)
   passed the Reapportionment Act of 1929 which capped the size of the
   House at 435 (the then current number). This cap has remained unchanged
   for more than eight decades. Three states – Wyoming, Vermont, and North
   Dakota – have populations smaller than the average for a single
   district.

   The "ideal" number of members has been a contentious issue since the
   country's founding. George Washington agreed that the original
   representation proposed during the Constitutional Convention (one
   representative for every 40,000) was inadequate and supported an
   alteration to reduce that number to 30,000.^[11] This was the only time
   that Washington pronounced an opinion on any of the actual issues
   debated during the entire convention.^[12]

   In Federalist No. 55, James Madison argued that the size of the House
   of Representatives has to balance the ability of the body to legislate
   with the need for legislators to have a relationship close enough to
   the people to understand their local circumstances, that such
   representatives' social class be low enough to sympathize with the
   feelings of the mass of the people, and that their power be diluted
   enough to limit their abuse of the public trust and interests.

     "... first, that so small a number of representatives will be an
     unsafe depositary of the public interests; secondly, that they will
     not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their
     numerous constituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that
     class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of
     the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent
     elevation of the few on the depression of the many;..."^[13]

   Madison also addressed Anti-Federalist claims that the representation
   would be inadequate, arguing that the major inadequacies are of minimal
   inconvenience since these will be cured rather quickly by virtue of
   decennial reapportionment. He noted, however,

     "I take for granted here what I shall, in answering the fourth
     objection, hereinafter show, that the number of representatives will
     be augmented from time to time in the manner provided by the
     Constitution. On a contrary supposition, I should admit the
     objection to have very great weight indeed."

   Madison argued against the assumption that more is better:

     "Sixty or seventy men may be more properly trusted with a given
     degree of power than six or seven. But it does not follow that six
     or seven hundred would be proportionally a better depositary. And if
     we carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand, the whole
     reasoning ought to be reversed. ... In all very numerous assemblies,
     of whatever character composed, passion never fails to wrest the
     scepter from reason."^[13]

Clemons v. Department of Commerce[edit]

   Main article: Clemons v. Department of Commerce

   A 2009 lawsuit, Clemons v. Department of Commerce, sought a court order
   for Congress to increase the size of the House's voting membership and
   then reapportion the seats in accordance with the population figures of
   the 2010 Census. The intent of the plaintiff was to rectify the
   disparity of congressional district population sizes among the states
   that result from the present method of apportionment. Upon reaching the
   U.S. Supreme Court in December 2010, the holdings of the lower district
   and appellate courts were vacated and the case remanded to the U.S.
   District Court from which the case originated with instructions that
   the district court dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.

Proposed expansion[edit]

   The first proposed amendment to the Constitution within the Bill of
   Rights attempted to set a pattern for growth of the House along with
   the population, but has not been ratified.

     Article the first... After the first enumeration required by the
     first article of the Constitution, there shall be one Representative
     for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one
     hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by
     Congress, that there shall be not less than one hundred
     Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every forty
     thousand persons, until the number of Representatives shall amount
     to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by
     Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred
     Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty
     thousand persons.^[14]

   The proposed Wyoming Rule calls for expanding the House until the
   standard Representative-to-population ratio equals that of the smallest
   entitled unit (currently the state of Wyoming). This proposal is
   primarily designed to address the fact that some House districts are
   currently nearly twice the size of others; for instance, there are
   nearly 1 million residents in Montana's single district, compared to
   about 570,000 in Wyoming's. See List of U.S. states by population. It
   should be noted that, while a larger House size will generally result
   in the smallest and largest districts being proportionally closer in
   size, this is not always the case. Therefore in some cases, the Wyoming
   Rule may actually result in an increase in the ratio of the sizes of
   the largest and smallest districts. For instance, after the 1990 Census
   and with a House size of 435, the largest district (Montana's At-large
   district) had 799,065 residents, 76% larger than the smallest district
   (Wyoming's At-large district with 453,588 residents). The Wyoming Rule
   would have given a House size of 547 in 1990. Using that size, the
   largest district (North Dakota's At-large district) would have had
   638,800 residents, 92% larger than the smallest districts (Delaware's
   two districts at approximately 333,084 residents each), which is larger
   than the 76% figure mentioned above.

   On May 21, 2001, Rep. Alcee Hastings sent a dear colleague letter
   pointing out that U.S. expansion of its legislature had not kept pace
   with other countries.^[15]

   In 2007, during the 110th Congress, Representative Tom Davis introduced
   a bill in the House of Representatives that would add two seats to the
   House, one for Utah and one for the District of Columbia. It was passed
   by the House, but was tripped up by procedural hurdles in Senate and
   withdrawn from consideration. An identical bill was reintroduced during
   the 111th Congress. In February 2009 the Senate adopted the measure
   61-37. In April 2010, however, House leaders decided to shelve the
   proposal.^[16]

Apportionment methods[edit]

   Apart from the requirement that the number of delegates for each state
   is at least one, a state's number of representatives is in principle
   proportional to population, thus assuring reasonably consistent
   representation to the people regardless of the state boundaries and
   populations. No method of calculating a fair distribution of voting
   power across the various states was known until recently and five
   distinct apportionment methods have been used since the adoption of the
   Constitution, none of them producing fully proportional distribution of
   power among the states.

   The current method, known as the method of equal proportions, has been
   used since the 1940 Census. The Vinton or Hamilton method, used from
   1850 to 1900, was susceptible to what is known as the apportionment
   paradox or Alabama paradox.^[17]

   In 2008, a so-called One-Person-One-Vote model was introduced by J.
   Toplak in Temple Law Review,^[18] which distributes the states' power
   in the House of Representatives exactly 'according to their Numbers'.
   Under this system, however, members of the House of Representatives do
   not have equal voting power. The method would be constitutional since
   the U.S. Constitution does not require Congressmen to have equal voting
   powers but does require the voters to have votes of equal
   weight.^[citation needed]^[19]

The Method of Equal Proportions[edit]

   Further information: Huntington–Hill method

   The apportionment methodology currently used is the method of equal
   proportions,^[20]^[21]^[22] so called because it guarantees that no
   additional transfer of a seat (from one state to another) will reduce
   the ratio between the numbers of persons per representative in any two
   states.^[23] According to NationalAtlas.gov, the method of equal
   proportions minimizes the percentage differences in the populations of
   the congressional districts.^[24]

   In this method, as a first step, each of the 50 states is given its one
   guaranteed seat in the House of Representatives, leaving 385 seats to
   assign.

   The remaining seats are allocated one at a time, to the state with the
   highest priority number. Thus, the 51st seat would go to the most
   populous state (currently California). The priority number is
   determined by a formula that is mathematically computed to be the ratio
   of the state population to the geometric mean of the number of seats it
   currently holds in the assignment process, n (initially 1), and the
   number of seats it would hold if the seat were assigned to it, n+1.

   The formula for determining the priority of a state to be apportioned
   the next available seat defined by the method of equal proportions is

          A_{n} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{n(n+1)}}

   where P is the population of the state, and n is the number of seats it
   currently holds before the possible allocation of the next seat. An
   equivalent, recursive definition is

          A_{n+1} = \sqrt{\frac{n}{n+2}} \ A_{n}

   where n is still the number of seats the state has before allocation of
   the next, and for n = 1, the initial A[1] is explicitly defined as

          A_{1} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{2}}

   Consider the reapportionment following the 2010 U.S. Census: beginning
   with all states initially being allocated one seat, the largest value
   of A[1] corresponds to the largest state, California, which is
   allocated seat 51. After being allocated its 2nd seat, its priority
   value decreases to its A[2] value, which is reordered to a position
   back in line. The 52nd seat goes to Texas, the 2nd largest state,
   because its A[1] priority value is larger than the A[n] of any other
   state. However, the 53rd seat goes back to California because its A[2]
   priority value is larger than the A[n] of any other state. The 54th
   seat goes to New York because its A[1] priority value is larger than
   the A[n] of any other state at this point. This process continues until
   all remaining seats are assigned. Each time a state is assigned a seat,
   n is incremented by 1, causing its priority value to be reduced and
   reordered among the states, whereupon another state normally rises to
   the top of the list.

   The Census 2010 Ranking of Priority Values^[25] shows the order in
   which seats 51–435 were apportioned after the 2010 Census, with
   additional listings for the next five priorities. Minnesota was
   allocated the final (435th) seat. North Carolina, which gained the
   435th seat in the 2000 census,^[26] missed its 14th seat by 15,754
   residents as the 436th seat to be allocated.

   The 1850 Apportionment bill provided a method to be used in future
   reapportionments, as well as establishing the then-current 233 as the
   number of seats to be apportioned after future censuses. Due to census
   returns being incomplete in California, an additional act provided that
   California retain the same representation it had when admitted, until a
   new census could be taken. California would otherwise have lost one
   seat, and so the total number of seats was increased by one to 234.

   seats were temporary increases^[29]
