   There is great variety in dance in the United States of America. It is
   the home of the hip hop dance and its derivative Rock and Roll, and
   modern square dance (associated with the United States of America due
   to its historic development in that country—nineteen U.S. states have
   designated it as their official state dance) and one of the major
   centers for modern dance^[citation needed]. There is a variety of
   social dance and concert or performance dance forms with also a range
   of traditions of Native American dances.

   The reality shows and competitions So You Think You Can Dance,^[1]
   Americas Best Dance Crew, and Dancing with the Stars have broadened the
   audience for dance.

African American dance[edit]

   Main article: African American dance
   See also: Lindy hop and Hip hop dance

   African American dances are those vernacular dances which have
   developed within African American communities in everyday spaces,
   rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. African American
   vernacular dances are usually centered on social dance practice, though
   performance dance and concert dance often supply complementary aspects
   to social dancing.

   Placing great value on improvisation, African American vernacular
   dances are characterised by ongoing change and development. Because
   they exist in social spaces and their main 'purpose' is
   self-expression, they are continually changing to reflect the needs,
   interests and personalities of their participants.

   Alvin Ailey and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater is an important
   example of African American involvement in performance or concert
   dance.

Swing dance[edit]

   See also: Lindy hop

   of the Moore Theatre (Seattle, Washington), 2007.

   The term "swing dance" refers to a group of dances that developed
   concurrently with jazz music in the 1920s, 30s and 40s. The
   prototypical swing dance is lindy hop, a popular partner dance that
   originated in Harlem and is still danced today. While the majority of
   swing dances began in African American communities as vernacular
   African American dances^[citation needed], some forms, like Balboa,
   developed within Anglo-American or other ethnic group communities.

   Dances such as the Black Bottom, charleston and tap dance travelled
   north with Dixieland jazz to New York, Kansas City, and Chicago in the
   Great Migration (African American) of the 1920s, where rural blacks
   travelled to escape persecution, Jim Crow laws, lynching and
   unemployment in the South (during the Great Depression).

   Swinging jazz music features the syncopated timing associated with
   African American and West African music and dance — a combination of
   crotchets and quavers which many swing dancers interpret as 'triple
   steps' and 'steps' — yet also introduces changes in the way these
   rhythms were played — a distinct delay or 'relaxed' approach to timing.

   Swing dance is now found globally, with great variety in their
   preferences for particular dances.

Modern dance[edit]

   Isadora Duncan
   Main article: Modern dance in the United States

   American modern dance developed in the early 20th century alongside
   American music. . Among the pioneers of modern dance were Isadora
   Duncan, the dance company of Ruth St. Denis and her husband-partner,
   Ted Shawn, and their pupils Doris Humphrey and Martha Graham. The early
   modern dance makers broke with European classical forms by giving into
   the weight of gravity, initiating movement from the center rather than
   the limbs, and emphasizing an emotional directness in their
   choreography. Many of Graham's most popular works were produced in
   collaboration with leading American composers -- "Appalachian Spring"
   with Aaron Copland, for example.

   Later choreographers, Merce Cunningham introduced chance procedures and
   composition by field, and Alvin Ailey incorporated African dance
   elements and black music into his works. Recently, Mark Morris and Liz
   Lerman have shown that graceful, exciting movement is not restricted by
   age or body type.
