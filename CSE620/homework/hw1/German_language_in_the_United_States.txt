History[edit]

   German became the second most widely spoken language in the U.S.
   starting with mass emigration to Pennsylvania from the German
   Palatinate and adjacent areas starting in the 1680s, all through the
   1700s and to the early 20th century. It was spoken by millions of
   immigrants from Germany, Switzerland, and the Austro-Hungarian and
   Russian Empires, and their descendants. Many newspapers, churches and
   schools operated in German as did many businesses. The use of the
   language was strongly suppressed by social and legal means during World
   War I, and German declined as a result, limiting the widespread use of
   the language mainly to Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities. After
   the First World War, German lost its position as the second most widely
   spoken language in the United States.^[8]^[9]

German-language Methodist Church[edit]

   Around 1800, two German-language Methodist churches were founded, the
   "Vereinigten Brüder in Christo" and the "Evangelische Gemeinschaft".
   Both used Methodist hymnals in German and published German newspapers,
   of which one existed until 1937. From the middle of the 19th century
   English was used as a second language in the churches, but there were
   regions in which German was the main church language into the 20th
   century. In 1937 both churches fused and joined the United Methodist
   Church in 1968.

German-language press[edit]

   The first German newspaper in the U.S. was der
   Hochdeutsch-Pennsylvanische Geschicht-Schreiber, oder Sammlung
   Wichtiger Nachrichten aus dem Natur- und Kirchen-Reich ("the High
   German-Pennsylvanian story-writer, or collection of important news from
   the realms of nature and the church"), later known as die Germantauner
   Zeitung.^[10] It was a German-language paper, Der Pennsylvanische
   Staatsbote that on July 5, 1776, was the first paper to report the
   American Declaration of Independence, and it did so in German
   translation. English readers would have to wait a day later to read the
   English text in the Pennsylvania Evening Post.

   In the 19th century the German press increased in importance and the
   number of dailies exploded. In 1909 a report stated "every American
   city or town with a large German population possesses one or more
   German newspapers. In New York City there are twelve or more… the best…
   being…the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung. The Illinois Staats-Zeitung has
   nearly as large a circulation, and the Milwaukee Germania claims the
   largest circulation of all. The Milwaukee Herold comes not far behind.
   Philadelphia has its Demokrat, Baltimore its Correspondent, Cincinnati
   its Volksblatt, St. Louis…its…Die Westliche Post and Der Anzeiger des
   Westens." It also reported that compared to 17,194 English papers in
   the U.S. in 1900, there were 613 German ones. The next largest language
   group, the Scandinavian, had only 115.^[10]

   With repression of the German language during World War I, the German
   press in America was reduced drastically.

Persecution during World War I[edit]

   When the U.S. joined in World War I, an anti-German hysteria quickly
   spread in American society. German-Americans, especially immigrants,
   were blamed for military acts of the German Empire, and even speaking
   German was seen as unpatriotic. Many German-American families
   anglicized their names (e.g. from Schmidt to Smith, Schneider to
   Taylor, Müller to Miller), and German nearly disappeared in public.
   Many states forbade the use of German in public and the teaching of
   German in schools.

   An extensive campaign forbid against all things German, such as
   performing the music of German composers at symphony concerts. Language
   was the focus of legislation at state and local levels. It took many
   forms, from requiring associations to have charters written in English
   to banning speaking German within city limits. Some states banned the
   teaching of all foreign languages, though most only banned German. A
   bill was introduced in October 1918 to create a national Department of
   Education, intended to restrict federal funds to states that enforced
   English-only education. The Lutheran Church was divided by an internal
   battle over conducting services and religious instruction in
   German.^[11]

   On April 9, 1919, Nebraska enacted a statute called "An act relating to
   the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska," commonly
   known as the Siman Act. It provided that "No person, individually or as
   a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public
   school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the
   English language." It forbid foreign instruction to children who not
   completed the eighth grade. A total ban on teaching German in both
   public and private schools was imposed for a time in Ohio, Iowa and
   Nebraska. The Supreme Court case in Meyer v. Nebraska ruled that these
   laws were unconstitutional, but German never recovered its position as
   the second language in the United States.

Pennsylvania Dutch[edit]

   Main article: Pennsylvania German language

   The Amish and other Pennsylvania Germans speak a dialect of German
   known as Pennsylvania German (also called Pennsylvania Dutch, where
   Dutch is used in its archaic sense, thus not limited to Dutch but
   including all variants of German).^[13] It is a remnant of what was
   once a much larger German-speaking area in eastern Pennsylvania. Most
   of the "Pennsylvania Dutch" originate from the Palatinate area of
   Germany and their language is based on the dialect of that region.^[14]

Indiana[edit]

   There is also a significant population of Amish and Old Order
   Mennonites located in rural areas of Elkhart County and LaGrange
   County, Indiana, who speak Pennsylvania Dutch. A much smaller community
   of Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking Amish is found in Parke County, in
   western Indiana. Many English words have become mixed with this dialect
   and it is quite different from Standard German (Hochdeutsch), but quite
   similar to the dialect of the Palatinate region.

   Usually, Pennsylvania Dutch (often just "Dutch" or "Deitsch") is spoken
   at home, but English is used when interacting with the general
   population.^[citation needed] The Amish and Old Order Mennonites of
   northern Indiana often differentiate between themselves and the general
   population by referring to them, respectively, as the "Amish" and the
   "English", noting the difference in language. Pennsylvania "Dutch" is
   sometimes used in worship services, though this is more common among
   the Amish than the Mennonites. More mainstream (city) Mennonites may
   have a working knowledge of the language, but it is not frequently used
   in conversation or in worship services.

Texas[edit]

   Main article: Texas German

   A dialect called Texas German is based in the Texas Hill Country around
   the town of Fredericksburg still exists, but has been dying out since
   the end of World War II. The atrocities of Hitler's Germany so
   embarrassed the locals that many ceased to speak it, which meant it was
   not passed on to their children.^[citation needed]

Hutterites[edit]

   Main article: Hutterite German

   Hutterite communities in the United States and Canada speak Hutterite
   German, an Austro-Bavarian dialect.^[citation needed] Hutterite is
   spoken in the U.S. states of Washington, Montana, North and South
   Dakota, and Minnesota; and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta,
   Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

German as the official US language myth[edit]

   An urban legend, sometimes called the Muhlenberg legend after Frederick
   Muhlenberg, states that English only narrowly defeated German as the
   U.S. official language. In reality, the proposal involved a requirement
   that government documents be translated into German.^[15]^[16] The
   United States has no statutory official language; English has been used
   on a de facto basis, owing to its status as the country's predominant
   language^[citation needed].

   In Pennsylvania, which had a large German-American population, German
   was long allowed as the language of instruction in schools,^[17] and
   state documents were available in German until 1950.^[citation needed]
   As a result of anti-German sentiment during World War I, the fluency
   decreased from one generation to the next and only a small fraction of
   Pennsylvanians of German descent are fluent in the German
   language.^[citation needed]

German-American tradition in literature[edit]

   The ties between Germany and the United States having been historically
   strong has brought about a number of important literary authors.^[18]
   In modern German literature, this topic has been addressed frequently
   by the Boston-born author of German and English lyrical poetry,
   Paul-Henri Campbell.

Use in education[edit]

   According to a government-financed survey, German was taught in 24% of
   American schools in 1997, and only 14% in 2008.^[19]

   German is third in popularity after Spanish and French in terms of the
   number of colleges and universities offering instruction in the
   language.^[20]
