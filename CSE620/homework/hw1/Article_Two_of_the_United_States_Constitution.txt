Section 1: President and Vice President[edit]

Clause 1: Executive Power[edit]

   Obama signing legislation at the Resolute desk

     The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
     States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four
     Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same
     Term, be elected, as follows^[1]

   Clause one is a "vesting clause," similar to other clauses in Articles
   One and Three, but it vests the power to execute the instructions of
   Congress, which has the exclusive power to make laws; "To make all laws
   which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
   foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in
   the government of the United States, or in any department or officer
   thereof."

   The head of the Executive Branch is the President of the United States.
   The President and the Vice President are elected every four years.

Clause 2: Method of choosing electors[edit]

     Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
     may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
     Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in
     the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
     Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be
     appointed an Elector.

   Under the U.S. Constitution the President and Vice President are chosen
   by Electors, under a constitutional grant of authority delegated to the
   legislatures of the several states and the District of Columbia (see
   Bush v. Gore). The constitution reserves the choice of the precise
   manner for creating Electors to the will of the state legislatures. It
   does not define or delimit what process a state legislature may use to
   create its state college of Electors. In practice, the state
   legislatures have generally chosen to create Electors through an
   indirect popular vote, since the 1820s.

   In an indirect popular vote, it is the names of the electors who are on
   the ballot to be elected. Typically, their names are aligned under the
   name of the candidate for President and Vice President, that they, the
   Elector, have pledged they will support. It is fully understood by the
   voters and the Electors themselves that they are the representative
   "stand-ins" for the individuals to whom they have pledged to cast their
   electoral college ballots to be President and Vice President. In some
   states, in past years, this pledge was informal, and Electors could
   still legally cast their electoral ballot for whomever they chose. More
   recently, state legislatures (exercising their constitutional authority
   to do so) have mandated in law that Electors shall cast their electoral
   college ballot for the Presidential Candidate to whom they are pledged.
   The constitutionality of such mandates is uncertain.

   Each state chooses as many Electors as it has Representatives and
   Senators representing it in Congress. Under the Twenty-third Amendment,
   the District of Columbia may choose no more electors than the state
   with the lowest number of electoral votes. No Senators, Representatives
   or federal officers may become Electors.

Clause 3: Electors[edit]

     The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by
     Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an
     Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a
     List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for
     each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to
     the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the
     President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the
     Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the
     Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having
     the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number
     be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if
     there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal
     Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately
     chuse [sic] by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person
     have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said
     House shall in like Manner chuse [sic] the President. But in chusing
     [sic] the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the
     Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this
     Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the
     States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a
     Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person
     having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the
     Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have
     equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse [sic] from them by Ballot the
     Vice President.

   (Note: This procedure was changed by the Twelfth Amendment in 1804.)

   In modern practice, each state chooses its electors in popular
   elections. Once chosen, the electors meet in their respective states to
   cast ballots for the President and Vice President. Originally, each
   elector cast two votes for President; at least one of the individuals
   voted for had to be from a state different from the elector's. The
   individual with the majority of votes became President, and the
   runner-up became Vice President. In case of a tie, the House of
   Representatives could choose one of the tied candidates; if no person
   received a majority, then the House could again choose one of the five
   with the greatest number of votes. When the House voted, each state
   delegation cast one vote, and the vote of a majority of states was
   necessary to choose a President. If second-place candidates were tied,
   then the Senate broke the tie. A quorum of two-thirds applied in both
   Houses: at least one member from each of two-thirds of the states in
   the House of Representatives, and at least two-thirds of the Senators
   in the Senate. This procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral
   vote produced a tie, and nearly resulted in a deadlock in the House.

   The Twelfth Amendment introduced a number of important changes to the
   procedure. Now, Electors do not cast two votes for President; rather,
   they cast one vote for President and another for Vice President. In
   case no Presidential candidate receives a majority, the House chooses
   from the top three (not five, as with Vice Presidential candidates).
   The Amendment also requires the Senate to choose the Vice President
   from those with the two highest figures if no Vice Presidential
   candidate receives a majority of electoral votes (rather than only if
   there's a tie for second for President). It also stipulates that to be
   the Vice President, a person must be qualified to be the President.

Clause 4: Election day[edit]

   Certificate for the vote for Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler
   for the State of Louisiana

     The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [sic] the Electors,
     and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be
     the same throughout the United States.

   Congress sets a national Election Day. Currently, Electors are chosen
   on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November, in the year
   before the President's term is to expire. The Electors cast their votes
   on the Monday following the second Wednesday in December of that year.
   Thereafter, the votes are opened and counted by the Vice President, as
   President of the Senate, in a joint session of Congress.

Clause 5: Qualifications for office[edit]

   Beginning of the clause in the 1787 document

   Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution sets forth
   the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United
   States:

     No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United
     States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be
     eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be
     eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of
     thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the
     United States.

   See also: Natural-born citizen and President of the United States

   By the time of their inauguration, the President and Vice President
   must be:
     * natural born citizens (including naturalization passed from
       parents)
     * at least thirty-five years old
     * inhabitants of the United States for at least fourteen years.

   In this 1944 poster, Franklin Roosevelt (left) successfully campaigned
   for a fourth term. He was the only President who served more than two
   terms.

   Eligibility for holding the office of President and Vice-President were
   modified by subsequent amendments:
     * The Twelfth Amendment (1804) requires the Vice-President must meet
       all of the qualifications of being a President.
     * The Twenty-second Amendment (1951) prevents a President from being
       elected more than twice.

Clause 6: Vacancy and disability[edit]

   An illustration: Tyler stands on his porch in Virginia, approached by a
   man with an envelope. Caption reads "Tyler receiving the news of
   Harrison's death."
   1888 illustration of Vice President Tyler receiving the news of
   President Harrison's death from Chief Clerk of the State Department
   Fletcher Webster.

     In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his
     Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties
     of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President,
     and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death,
     Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President,
     declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer
     shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a
     President shall be elected.

   The wording of this clause caused much controversy at the time it was
   first used. When William Henry Harrison died in office, a debate arose
   over whether the Vice President would become President, or if he would
   just inherit the powers, thus becoming an Acting President. Harrison's
   Vice President, John Tyler, believed that he had the right to become
   President. However, many Senators argued that he only had the right to
   assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new
   election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was
   impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler ended up taking
   the Oath of Office and became President, setting a precedent that is
   followed to this day. Tyler's precedent made it possible for Vice
   Presidents Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester Arthur, Theodore
   Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, and Lyndon Johnson to ascend
   to the presidency (Gerald Ford took office after the passage of the
   Twenty-fifth Amendment).

   John Tyler's precedent established that if the President's office
   becomes vacant due to death, resignation or disqualification, the Vice
   President becomes President. The Congress may provide for a line of
   succession beyond the Vice President. The Presidential Succession Act
   establishes the order as: the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
   the President pro tempore of the Senate and then the fifteen Cabinet
   Secretaries in order of that Department's establishment.

   The Twenty-fifth Amendment explicitly states that when the Presidency
   is vacant, then the Vice President becomes President. This provision
   applied at the time Gerald Ford succeeded to the Presidency. In case of
   a Vice Presidential vacancy, the Amendment permits the President to
   appoint, with the approval of both Houses of Congress, a new Vice
   President. Furthermore, the Amendment provides that the President, or
   the Vice President and Cabinet, can declare the President unable to
   discharge his duties, in which case the Vice President becomes Acting
   President. If the declaration is done by the Vice President and
   Cabinet, the Amendment permits the President to take control back,
   unless the Vice President and Cabinet challenge the President and
   two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the Vice
   President and Cabinet. If the declaration is done by the President, he
   may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress.

Clause 7: Salary[edit]

     The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a
     Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during
     the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not
     receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United
     States, or any of them.

   The President's salary, currently $400,000 a year, must remain constant
   throughout the President's term. The President may not receive other
   compensation from either the federal or any state government.

Clause 8: Oath or affirmation[edit]

   President Barack Obama being administered the oath of office by Chief
   Justice John Roberts for the second time, on January 21, 2009.
   Further information: Oath of office of the President of the United
   States

     Before he enters the Execution of his Office, he shall take the
     following Oath or Affirmation:—"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that
     I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
     States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and
     defend the Constitution of the United States."

   According to the Joint Congressional Committee on Presidential
   Inaugurations, George Washington added the words "So help me God"
   during his first inaugural,^[2] though this has been disputed. There
   are no contemporaneous sources for this fact, and no eyewitness sources
   to Washington's first inaugural mention the phrase at all—including
   those that transcribed what he said for his oath.

   Also, the President-elect's name is typically added after the "I", for
   example, "I, George Washington, do...." Normally, the Chief Justice of
   the United States administers the oath. It is sometimes asserted that
   the oath bestows upon the President the power to do whatever is
   necessary to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution." Andrew
   Jackson, while vetoing an Act for the renewal of the charter of the
   national bank, implied that the President could refuse to execute
   statutes that he felt were unconstitutional. In suspending the
   privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, President Abraham Lincoln
   claimed that he acted according to the oath. His action was challenged
   in court and overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court in Maryland (led by
   Chief Justice Roger B. Taney) in Ex Parte Merryman, 17 F. Cas. 144
   (C.C.D. Md. 1861). Lincoln ignored Taney's order. Finally, Andrew
   Johnson's counsel referred to the theory during his impeachment trial.
   Otherwise, few have seriously asserted that the oath augments the
   President's powers.

   The Vice President also has an oath of office, but it is not mandated
   by the Constitution and is prescribed by statute. Currently, the Vice
   Presidential oath is the same as that for Members of Congress.

          I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend
          the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
          foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance
          to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any
          mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well
          and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am
          about to enter. So help me God.^[3]

Section 2: Presidential powers[edit]

   In the landmark decision Nixon v. General Services Administration
   Justice William Rehnquist, afterwards the Chief Justice, declared in
   his dissent the need to "fully describe the preeminent position that
   the President of the United States occupies with respect to our
   Republic. Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole
   repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers
   entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome
   indeed."

Clause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons[edit]

   Three men are seated in lounge chairs. One is standing, holding a long
   stick and pointing to the location of Japan on a wall map of the
   Pacific.
   President Franklin Roosevelt as Commander in Chief, with his military
   subordinates during World War II.
   Left to right: General Douglas MacArthur, President Franklin Roosevelt,
   Admiral William D. Leahy, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.

     The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of
     the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when
     called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require
     the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the
     executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of
     their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves
     and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases
     of Impeachment.

   The Constitution vests the President with Executive Power. That power
   reaches its zenith when wielded to protect national security.^[4] And
   federal courts in the United States must pay proper deference to the
   Executive in assessing the threats that face the nation.^[5] The
   President is the military's commander-in-chief; however Article One
   gives Congress and not the President the exclusive right to declare
   war. Nevertheless, the power of the president to initiate hostilities
   has been subject to question. According to historian Thomas Woods,
   "Ever since the Korean War, Article II, Section 2 [...] has been
   interpreted 'The president has the power to initiate hostilities
   without consulting Congress' [....]But what the framers actually meant
   by that clause was that once war has been declared, it was the
   President’s responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war.
   Alexander Hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president,
   although lacking the power to declare war, would have “the direction of
   war when authorized or begun.” The president acting alone was
   authorized only to repel sudden attacks (hence the decision to withhold
   from him only the power to “declare” war, not to “make” war, which was
   thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack).
   ^[6]^[7] Since World War II, every major military action has been
   technically a U.S. military operation or a U.N. "police action", which
   are deemed legally legitimate by Congress, and various United Nations
   Resolutions because of decisions such as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
   or the The Resolution of The Congress Providing Authorization for Use
   of Force In Iraq.

   The President may require the "principal officer" of any executive
   department to tender his advice in writing. Thus, implicitly, the
   Constitution creates a Cabinet that includes the principal officers of
   the various departments.

   The President, furthermore, may grant pardon or reprieves, except in
   cases of impeachment. Originally, as ruled by the Supreme Court in
   United States v. Wilson (1833), the pardon could be rejected by the
   convict. In Biddle v. Perovich 274 U.S. 480 (1927), the Supreme Court
   reversed the doctrine, ruling that "[a] pardon in our days is not a
   private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It
   is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the
   determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be
   better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed."^[8]

Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause[edit]

   The President exercises the powers in the Advice and Consent Clause
   with the advice and consent of the Senate.

     He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the
     Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators
     present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice
     and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public
     Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other
     Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
     otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but
     the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior
     Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the
     Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.

Treaties[edit]

   Main article: Treaty Clause

   The President may enter the United States into treaties, but they are
   not effective until ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.^[9] In
   Article II however, the Constitution is not very explicit about the
   termination of treaties. The first abrogation of a treaty occurred in
   1798, when Congress passed a law terminating a 1778 Treaty of Alliance
   with France.^[10] In the nineteenth century, several Presidents
   terminated treaties after Congress passed resolutions requesting the
   same.^[11] In 1854, however, President Franklin Pierce terminated a
   treaty with Denmark with the consent of the Senate alone. A Senate
   committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the President to
   terminate treaties after being authorized by the Senate alone, and not
   the entire Congress. President Pierce's successors, however, returned
   to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both Houses.
   Some Presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of
   terminating treaties. Abraham Lincoln, for instance, terminated a
   treaty without prior Congressional authorization, but Congress
   retroactively approved his decision at a later point. The first
   unambiguous case of a President terminating a treaty without
   authorization, granted prior to or after the termination, occurred when
   Jimmy Carter terminated a treaty with the Republic of China.^[12] For
   the first time, judicial determination was sought, but the effort
   proved futile: the Supreme Court could not find a majority agreeing on
   any particular principle, and therefore instructed the trial court to
   dismiss the case.

Appointments[edit]

   Main article: Appointments Clause

   The President may also appoint judges, ambassadors, consuls, ministers
   and other officers with the advice and consent of the Senate. By law,
   however, Congress may allow the President, heads of executive
   departments, or the courts to appoint inferior officials.

   The Senate has a long-standing practice of permitting motions to
   reconsider previous decisions. In 1931, the Senate granted advice and
   consent to the President on the appointment of a member of the Federal
   Power Commission. The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate,
   under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the advice and
   consent. In the writ of quo warranto proceedings that followed, the
   Supreme Court ruled that the Senate was not permitted to rescind advice
   and consent after the officer had been installed.

   After the Senate grants advice and consent, however, the President is
   under no compulsion to commission the officer. It has not been settled
   whether the President has the prerogative to withhold a commission
   after having signed it. This issue played a large part in the famous
   court case Marbury v. Madison.

   At times the President has asserted the power to remove individuals
   from office. Congress has often explicitly limited the President's
   power to remove; during the Reconstruction Era, Congress passed the
   Tenure of Office Act, purportedly preventing Andrew Johnson from
   removing, without the advice and consent of the Senate, anyone
   appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. President Johnson
   ignored the Act, and was later impeached and acquitted. The
   constitutionality of the Act was not immediately settled. In Myers v.
   United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), the Supreme Court held that Congress
   could not limit the President's power to remove an executive officer
   (the Postmaster General), but in Humphrey's Executor v. United States,
   295 U.S. 602 (1935) it upheld Congress's authority to restrict the
   President's power to remove officers of the Federal Trade Commission,
   an "administrative body [that] cannot in any proper sense be
   characterized as an arm or eye of the executive."

   Congress may repeal the legislation that authorizes the appointment of
   an executive officer. But it "cannot reserve for itself the power of an
   officer charged with the execution of the laws except by
   impeachment."^[13] Congress has from time to time changed the number of
   justices in the Supreme Court.

Clause 3: Recess appointments[edit]

   President George W. Bush announcing the August 1, 2005 recess
   appointment of John R. Bolton as the U.S. Ambassador to the United
   Nations as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice looks on.
   Main article: Recess appointment

     The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may
     happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions
     which shall expire at the End of their next Session.

   During recesses of the Senate, the President may appoint officers, but
   their commissions expire at the conclusion of the Senate's next
   session.

Section 3: Presidential responsibilities[edit]

     He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the
     State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such
     Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on
     extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and
     in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of
     Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think
     proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he
     shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall
     Commission all the Officers of the United States.

Clause 1: State of the Union[edit]

   2011 State of the Union Address given by President Barack Obama

   The President must give the Congress information on the "State of the
   Union" "from time to time." This is called the State of the Union
   Clause.^[14] Originally, Presidents personally delivered annual
   addresses to Congress. Thomas Jefferson, who felt that the procedure
   resembled the Speech from the Throne delivered by British monarchs,
   chose instead to send written messages to Congress for reading by
   clerks. Jefferson's procedure was followed by future Presidents until
   Woodrow Wilson reverted to the former procedure of personally
   addressing Congress, which has continued to this day^[update].^[14]

   Kesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the State of the Union clause:

          "The State of the Union Clause imposes an executive duty on the
          President. That duty must be discharged periodically. The
          President's assessment of the State of the Union must be
          publicized to Congress, and thus to the nation. The publication
          of the President's assessment conveys information to Congress-
          information uniquely gleaned from the President's perspective in
          his various roles as Commander-in-Chief, chief law enforcer,
          negotiator with foreign powers, and the like-that shall aid the
          legislature in public deliberation on matters that may justify
          the enactment of legislation because of their national
          importance."^[14]

Clause 2: Making recommendations to Congress[edit]

   The president has the power and duty^[14] to recommend, for the
   consideration of Congress, such measures which the president deems as
   "necessary and expedient". At his inauguration George Washington
   declared in his Inaugural Address: "By the article establishing the
   executive department it is made the duty of the President "to recommend
   to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and
   expedient."" This is the Recommendation Clause.^[15]'

   Kesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the Recommendation clause:

          "The Recommendation Clause also imposes an executive duty on the
          President. His recommendations respect the equal dignity of
          Congress and thus embody the anti-royalty sentiment that ignited
          the American Revolution and subsequently stripped the trappings
          of monarchy away from the new chief executive. Through his
          recommendations to Congress, the President speaks collectively
          for the People as they petition Government for a redress of
          grievances, and thus his recommendations embody popular
          sovereignty. The President tailors his recommendations so that
          their natural implication is the enactment of new legislation,
          rather than some other action that Congress might undertake.
          Finally, the President shall have executive discretion to
          recommend measures of his choosing."^[14]

   Sidak explained that there is a connection between the Recommendation
   clause and the Petition Clause of the first amendment: "Through his
   performance of the duty to recommend measures to Congress, the
   President functions as the agent of a diffuse electorate who seek the
   redress of grievances. To muzzle the President, therefore, is to
   diminish the effectiveness of this right expressly reserved to the
   people under the first amendment."^[15]^:2119, note 7 Kesavan and Sidak
   also cited a Professor Bybee who stated in this context: "The
   Recommendation Clause empowers the President to represent the people
   before Congress, by recommending measures for the reform of government,
   for the general welfare, or for the redress of grievances. The Right of
   Petition Clause prevents Congress from abridging the right of the
   people to petition for a redress of grievances."^[14]^:43

   The Recommendation clause imposes a duty, but its performance rests
   solely with the President. Congress possesses no power to compel the
   President to recommend, as he alone is the "judge" of what is
   "necessary and expedient." Unlike the Necessary and Proper Clause of
   Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its
   delegated powers, the phrase "necessary and expedient" implies a wider
   range of discretion for the President. Because this is a political
   question, there has been little judicial involvement with the
   President's actions under the clause as long as Presidents have not
   tried to extend their legislative powers. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube
   Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations
   Clause serves as a reminder that the President cannot make law by
   himself: "The power to recommend legislation, granted to the President,
   serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that
   it is the function of the Congress to legislate."^[16] The Court made a
   similar point in striking down the line-item veto in Clinton v. City of
   New York (1998).^[16] When President William Jefferson Clinton
   attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force on Health
   Care Reform as essential to his functions under the Recommendations
   Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in
   Ass'n of American Physicians & Surgeons v. Clinton (1993): "[T]he
   Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The President
   has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not
   exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for
   that matter, any subject."^[16]

Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning
Congress[edit]

   The President may call extraordinary sessions of one or both Houses of
   Congress. If the two Houses cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the
   President may adjourn both Houses to such a time as befits the
   circumstances. The last time this power was exercised was in 1948, when
   President Harry S Truman called a special session of Congress. That was
   the twenty-seventh time in American history that a president convened
   such a session.^[17]

Clause 4: Receiving foreign representatives[edit]

   The President receives all foreign Ambassadors. This clause of the
   Constitution has been interpreted to imply that the President has broad
   power over all matters of foreign policy.^[18]

Clause 5: Caring for the faithful execution of the law[edit]

   The President must "take care that the laws be faithfully
   executed."^[19] This clause in the Constitution imposes a duty on the
   President to take due care while executing laws and is called the Take
   Care Clause,^[20] also known as the Faithful Execution Clause^[21] or
   Faithfully Executed Clause.^[22] This clause is meant to ensure that a
   law is faithfully executed by the President,^[20] even if he disagrees
   with the purpose of that law.^[23] By virtue of his executive power,
   the President may execute the law and control the law execution of
   others. Under the Take Care Clause, however, the President must
   exercise his law-execution power to "take Care that the Laws be
   faithfully executed."^[21] Addressing the North Carolina ratifying
   convention, William Maclaine declared that the Faithful Execution
   Clause was "one of the [Constitution's] best provisions."^[21] If the
   President "takes care to see the laws faithfully executed, it will be
   more than is done in any government on the continent; for I will
   venture to say that our government, and those of the other states, are,
   with respect to the execution of the laws, in many respects mere
   ciphers."^[21] President George Washington interpreted this clause as
   imposing on him a unique duty to ensure the execution of federal law.
   Discussing a tax rebellion, Washington observed, "it is my duty to see
   the Laws executed: to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity
   would be repugnant to" that duty.^[21]

   According to former United States Assistant Attorney General Walter E.
   Dellinger III the Supreme Court and the Attorneys General have long
   interpreted the Take Care Clause as standing for the proposition that
   the President has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend the
   enforcement of the laws, particularly of statutes.^[24] Quite the
   contrary: The Take Care Clause demands that the President obey the law,
   the Supreme Court said in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, and
   repudiates any notion that he may dispense with the law's
   execution.^[25] In Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), the
   Supreme Court explained how the President executes the law: "The
   Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the
   laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, "shall take Care that
   the Laws be faithfully executed," Art. II, §3, personally and through
   officers whom he appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress
   may authorize to be appointed by the "Courts of Law" or by "the Heads
   of Departments" who with other presidential appointees), Art. II, §2."

   The President possesses wide discretion in deciding how and even when
   to enforce laws. He also has a range of interpretive discretion in
   deciding the meaning of laws he must execute. When an appropriation
   provides discretion, the President can gauge when and how appropriated
   moneys can be spent most efficiently. However, the President may not
   prevent a member of the executive branch from performing a ministerial
   duty lawfully imposed upon him by Congress. (See Marbury v. Madison
   (1803); and Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes (1838)). Nor may
   the President take an action not authorized either by the Constitution
   or by a lawful statute. (See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer
   (1952)). Finally, the President may not refuse to enforce a
   constitutional law, or "cancel" certain appropriations, for that would
   amount to an extra-constitutional veto or suspension power.^[21]

   Some Presidents have claimed the authority under this clause to impound
   money appropriated by Congress. President Jefferson, for example,
   delayed the expenditure of money appropriated for the purchase of
   gunboats for over a year. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his
   successors sometimes refused outright to expend appropriated
   money.^[21] The Supreme Court, however, has held that impoundments
   without Congressional authorization are unconstitutional.^[26]

   It has been asserted that the President's responsibility in the
   "faithful" execution of the laws entitles him to suspend the privilege
   of the writ of habeas corpus^[citation needed]. Article One provides
   that the privilege may not be suspended save during times of rebellion
   or invasion, but it does not specify who may suspend the privilege. The
   Supreme Court ruled that Congress may suspend the privilege if it deems
   it necessary. During the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln
   suspended the privilege, but, owing to the vehement opposition he
   faced, obtained congressional authorization for the same.^[citation
   needed] Since then, the privilege of the writ has only been suspended
   upon the express authorization of Congress.

   In Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475 (1867), the Supreme Court ruled
   that the judiciary may not restrain the President in the execution of
   laws. In that case the Supreme Court refused to entertain a request for
   an injunction preventing President Andrew Johnson from executing the
   Reconstruction Acts, which were claimed to be unconstitutional. The
   Court found that "[t]he Congress is the legislative department of the
   government; the President is the executive department. Neither can be
   restrained in its action by the judicial department; though the acts of
   both, when performed, are, in proper cases, subject to its
   cognizance."^[27] Thus, the courts cannot bar the passage of a law by
   Congress, though it may strike down such a law as unconstitutional. A
   similar construction applies to the executive branch.

Clause 6: Officers' commissions[edit]

   The President commissions "all the Officers of the United States."
   These include officers in both military and foreign service. (Under
   Article I, Section 8, the States have authority for "the Appointment of
   the Officers . . . of the [State] Militia . . ..")

   The presidential authority to commission officers had a large impact on
   the 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, where outgoing Federalist President
   John Adams feverishly signed many commissions to the judiciary on his
   final day in office, hoping to, as incoming Democratic-Republican
   President Thomas Jefferson put it, "[retire] into the judiciary as a
   stronghold." However, in his haste, Adams' Secretary of State neglected
   to have all the commissions delivered. Incoming President Jefferson was
   enraged with Adams, and ordered his Secretary of State, James Madison,
   to refrain from delivering the remaining commissions. William Marbury
   took the matter to the Supreme Court, where the famous Marbury was
   decided.

Section 4: Impeachment[edit]

   Depiction of the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, in
   1868, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding.
   Main article: Impeachment in the United States

     The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United
     States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and
     Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and
     Misdemeanors.

   The Constitution also allows for involuntary removal from office. The
   President, Vice-President, Cabinet Secretaries, and other executive
   officers, as well as judges, may be impeached by the House of
   Representatives and tried in the Senate.

   Any official convicted by impeachment is immediately removed from
   office. The Senate may also choose to bar the removed official from
   holding any federal office in the future.^[28] No other punishments may
   be inflicted pursuant to the impeachment proceeding, but the convicted
   party remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil
   and criminal charges.^[29]
