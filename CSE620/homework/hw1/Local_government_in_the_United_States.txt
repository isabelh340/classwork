   Local government in the United States refers to governmental
   jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least
   two tiers of local government: counties and municipalities. In some
   states, counties are divided into townships. There are several
   different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the
   city, town, borough, and village. The types and nature of these
   municipal entities varies from state to state. Many rural areas and
   even some suburban areas of many states have no municipal government
   below the county level. In other places consolidated city–county
   jurisdictions exist, in which city and county functions are managed by
   a single municipal government. In some New England states, towns are
   the primary unit of local government and counties have no governmental
   function but exist in a purely perfunctory capacity (e.g. for census
   data).

   In addition to general purpose local governments, there may be local or
   regional special-purpose local governments,^[1] such as school
   districts and districts for fire protection, sanitary sewer service,
   public transportation, public libraries, or water resource management.
   Such special purpose districts often encompass areas in multiple
   municipalities. As of 2012, there were 89,055 local government units in
   the United States.^[1]

History[edit]

   When America was settled by Europeans from the 17th century onward,
   there was initially little control from governments back in Europe.^[2]
   Many settlements began as shareholder or stockholder business
   enterprises, and while the king of Britain had technical sovereignty,
   in most instances "full governmental authority was vested in the
   company itself."^[2] Settlers had to fend for themselves; compact towns
   sprung up based as legal corporations in what has been described as
   "pure democracy":
   “ The people, owing to the necessity of guarding against the Indians
     and wild animals, and to their desire to attend the same church,
     settled in small, compact communities, or townships, which they called
     towns. The town was a legal corporation, was the political unit, and
     was represented in the General Court. It was a democracy of the purest
     type. Several times a year the adult males met in town meeting to
     discuss public questions, to lay taxes, to make local laws, and to
     elect officers. The chief officers were the "selectmen," from three to
     nine in number, who should have the general management of the public
     business; the town clerk, treasurer, constables, assessors, and
     overseers of the poor. To this day the town government continues in a
     large measure in some parts of New England.––historian Henry William
     Elson writing in 1904.^[3]                                              ”

   Propertied men voted; in no colonies was there universal suffrage.^[4]
   The founding by a group of Puritans in 1629, led by John Winthrop came
   with the understanding that the enterprise was to be "based in the new
   world rather than in London".^[5] Small towns in Massachusetts were
   compared to city-states in a somewhat oligarchic form, but an oligarchy
   based on "perceived virtue" rather than wealth or birth.^[5] The notion
   of self-government became accepted in the colonies although it wasn't
   totally free from challenges; in the 1670s, the Lords of Trade and
   Plantations (a royal committee regulating mercantile trade in the
   colonies) tried to annul the Massachusetts Bay charter, but by 1691,
   the New England colonies had reinstalled their previous
   governments.^[6]

   Voting was established as a precedent early on; in fact, one of the
   first things that Jamestown settlers did was conduct an election.^[7]
   Typically, voters were white males described as "property owners" aged
   twenty-one and older, but sometimes the restrictions were greater, and
   in practice, persons able to participate in elections were few.^[7]
   Women were prevented from voting (although there were a few exceptions)
   and African-Americans were excluded.^[7] The colonists never thought of
   themselves as subservient but rather as having a loose association with
   authorities in London.^[6] Representative government sprung up
   spontaneously in various colonies, and during the colonial years, it
   was recognized and ratified by later charters.^[2] But the colonial
   assemblies passed few bills and did not conduct much business, but
   dealt with a narrow range of issues, and legislative sessions lasted
   weeks (occasionally longer), and most legislators could not afford to
   neglect work for extended periods; so wealthier people tended to
   predominate in local legislatures.^[7] Office holders tended to serve
   from a sense of duty and prestige, and not for financial benefit.^[7]
   “ Campaigning by candidates was different from today's. There were no
     mass media or advertising. Candidates talked with voters in person,
     walking a line between undue familiarity and aloofness. Prospective
     officeholders were expected to be at the polls on election day and made
     a point to greet all voters. Failure to appear or to be civil to all
     could be disastrous. In some areas, candidates offered voters food and
     drink, evenhandedly giving "treats" to opponents as well as
     supporters.––Ed Crews.^[7]                                             ”

   Taxes were generally based on real estate since it was fixed in place,
   plainly visible, and its value was generally well known, and revenue
   could be allocated to the government unit where the property was
   located.^[8]

   After the American Revolution, the electorate chose the governing
   councils in almost every American municipality, and state governments
   began issuing municipal charters.^[9] During the 19th century, many
   municipalities were granted charters by the state governments and
   became technically municipal corporations.^[9] Townships and county
   governments and city councils shared much of the responsibility for
   decision-making which varied from state to state.^[9] As the United
   States grew in size and complexity, decision-making authority for
   issues such as business regulation, taxation, environmental regulation
   moved to state governments and the national government, while local
   governments retained control over such matters as zoning issues,
   property taxes, and public parks.^[citation needed] The concept of
   "zoning" originated in the U.S. during the 1920s, according to one
   source, in which state law gave certain townships or other local
   governing bodies authority to decide how land was used; a typical
   zoning ordinance has a map of a parcel of land attached with a
   statement specifying how that land can be used, how buildings can be
   laid out, and so forth.^[10] Zoning legitimacy was upheld by the
   Supreme Court in its Euclid v. Ambler decision.^[10]

Types[edit]

   The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes local
   government a matter of state rather than federal law, with special
   cases for territories and the District of Columbia. As a result, the
   states have adopted a wide variety of systems of local government. The
   United States Census Bureau conducts the Census of Governments every
   five years to compile statistics on government organization, public
   employment, and government finances. The categories of local government
   established in this Census of Governments is a convenient basis for
   understanding local government in the United States. The categories are
   as follows:^[1]
    1. County Governments
    2. Town or Township Governments
    3. Municipal Governments
    4. Special-Purpose Local Governments

County governments[edit]

   Main article: County (United States)

   County governments are organized local governments authorized in state
   constitutions and statutes. Counties and county-equivalents form the
   first-tier administrative division of the states.

   All the states are divided into counties or county-equivalents for
   administrative purposes, although not all counties or
   county-equivalents have an organized county government. Connecticut and
   Rhode Island have completely eliminated county government, as have
   portions of Massachusetts. The Unorganized Borough in Alaska also does
   not operate under a county level government. Additionally, a number of
   independent cities and consolidated city-counties operate under a
   municipal government that serves the functions of both city and county.

   In areas lacking a county government, services are provided either by
   lower level townships or municipalities, or the state.

Town or township governments[edit]

   Main article: Civil township

   Town or township governments are organized local governments authorized
   in the state constitutions and statutes of 20 Northeastern and
   Midwestern states,^[1] established to provide general government for a
   defined area, generally based on the geographic subdivision of a
   county. Depending on state law and local circumstance, a township may
   or may not be incorporated, and the degree of authority over local
   government services may vary greatly.

   Towns in the six New England states and townships in New Jersey and
   Pennsylvania are included in this category despite the fact that they
   are legally municipal corporations since their structure has no
   necessary relation to concentration of population,^[1] which is typical
   of municipalities elsewhere in the United States. In particular, towns
   in New England have considerably more power than most townships
   elsewhere and often function as independent cities in all but name,
   typically exercising the full range of powers that are divided between
   counties, townships, and cities in other states.^[11]

   An additional dimension that distinguishes township governments from
   municipalities is the historical circumstance surrounding their
   formation. For example, towns in New England are also defined by a
   tradition of local government presided over by town meetings —
   assemblies open to all voters to express their opinions on public
   policy.

   The term "town" is also used for a local level of government in New
   York and Wisconsin. The terms "town" and "township" are used
   interchangeably in Minnesota.

Municipal governments[edit]

   Main articles: Municipality, City, Town, Village (United States) and
   Borough (United States)

   Municipal governments are organized local governments authorized in
   state constitutions and statutes, established to provide general
   government for a defined area, generally corresponding to a population
   center rather than one of a set of areas into which a county is
   divided. The category includes those governments designated as cities,
   boroughs (except in Alaska), towns (except in Minnesota and Wisconsin),
   and villages.^[12] This concept corresponds roughly to the
   "incorporated places" that are recognized in Census Bureau reporting of
   population and housing statistics, although the Census Bureau excludes
   New England towns from their statistics for this category, and the
   count of municipal governments excludes places that are governmentally
   inactive.

   Municipalities range in size from the very small (e.g., the Village of
   Lazy Lake, Florida, with 38 residents), to the very large (e.g., New
   York City, with about 8 million people), and this is reflected in the
   range of types of municipal governments that exist in different areas.

   In most states, county and municipal governments exist side-by-side.
   There are exceptions to this, however. In some states, a city can,
   either by separating from its county or counties or by merging with one
   or more counties, become independent of any separately functioning
   county government and function both as a county and as a city.
   Depending on the state, such a city is known as either an independent
   city or a consolidated city-county. Such a jurisdiction constitutes a
   county-equivalent and is analogous to a unitary authority in other
   countries. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts,
   counties exist only to designate boundaries for such state-level
   functions as park districts or judicial offices (Massachusetts).
   Municipal governments are usually administratively divided into several
   departments, depending on the size of the city. Though cities differ in
   the division of responsibility, the typical arrangement is to have the
   following departments handle the following roles:
    1. Urban planning/zoning
    2. Economic development/tourism
    3. Public works - construction and maintenance of all city-owned or
       operated assets, including the water supply system, sewer, streets,
       stormwater, snow removal, street cleaning, street signs, vehicles,
       buildings, land, etc.
    4. Parks and recreation - construction and maintenance of city parks,
       common areas, parkways, publicly owned land, operation of various
       recreation programs and facilities
    5. Police
    6. Fire
    7. Emergency medical services
    8. Emergency management
    9. Accounting/finance - often tax collection, audits
   10. Human resources - for city workers
   11. General counsel/city attorney/risk management - legal matters such
       as writing municipal bonds, ensuring city compliance with state and
       federal law, responding to citizen lawsuits stemming from city
       actions or inactions.
   12. Transportation (varies widely) - if the city has a municipal bus or
       light rail service, this function may be its own department or it
       may be folded into the another of the above departments.
   13. Information technology - supports computer systems used by city
       employees; may be also responsible for a city website, phones and
       other systems.
   14. Housing department
   15. Municipal court

Special-purpose local governments[edit]

School districts[edit]

   Main article: School district

   School districts are organized local entities providing public
   elementary and secondary education which, under state law, have
   sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate
   governments. The category excludes dependent public school systems of
   county, municipal, township, or state governments (e.g., school
   divisions).

Special districts[edit]

   Main article: Special-purpose district

   Special districts are all organized local entities other than the four
   categories listed above, authorized by state law to provide designated
   functions as established in the district's charter or other founding
   document, and with sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to
   qualify as separate governments;^[13] known by a variety of titles,
   including districts, authorities, boards, commissions, etc., as
   specified in the enabling state legislation. A special district may
   serve areas of multiple states if established by an interstate compact.
   Special districts are widely popular, have enjoyed "phenomenal growth"
   and "nearly tripled in number" from 1957 to 2007.^[14]

Councils or associations of governments[edit]

   It is common for residents of major U.S. metropolitan areas to live
   under six or more layers of special districts as well as a town or
   city, and a county or township.^[15] In turn, a typical metro area
   often consists of several counties, several dozen towns or cities, and
   a hundred (or more) special districts. In one state, California, the
   fragmentation problem became so bad that in 1963 the California
   Legislature created Local Agency Formation Commissions in 57 of the
   state's 58 counties; that is, government agencies to supervise the
   orderly formation and development of other government agencies. One
   effect of all this complexity is that victims of government negligence
   occasionally sue the wrong entity and do not realize their error until
   the statute of limitations has run against them.^[16]

   Because efforts at direct consolidation have proven futile, U.S. local
   government entities often form "councils of governments," "metropolitan
   regional councils," or "associations of governments." These
   organizations serve as regional planning agencies and as forums for
   debating issues of regional importance, but are generally powerless
   relative to their individual members.^[17] Since the late 1990s, "a
   movement, frequently called 'New Regionalism,' accepts the futility of
   seeking consolidated regional governments and aims instead for regional
   structures that do not supplant local governments."^[18]

Dillon's Rule[edit]

   Unlike the relationship of federalism that exists between the U.S.
   government and the states (in which power is shared), municipal
   governments have no power except what is granted to them by their
   states. This legal doctrine was established by Judge John Forrest
   Dillon in 1872 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Hunter v.
   Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161 (1907), which upheld the power of Pennsylvania
   to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh,
   despite the wishes of the majority of Allegheny residents. In effect,
   state governments can place whatever restrictions they choose on their
   municipalities (including merging municipalities, controlling them
   directly, or abolishing them outright), as long as such rules don't
   violate the state's constitution.

   Dillon's Rule does not apply in all states of the United States. The
   constitutional provisions of some states provide specific rights for
   municipalities and counties.^[19] State constitutions which allow
   counties or municipalities to enact ordinances without the
   legislature's permission are said to provide home rule authority.^[20]
   A state which is both a home rule state and a Dillon's Rule state
   applies Dillon's Rule to matters or governmental units not accounted
   for in the constitutional amendment or statutes which grant home rule.
   New Jersey, for example, provides for home rule.^[21]

Governing bodies[edit]

   The nature of both county and municipal government varies not only
   between states, but also between different counties and municipalities
   within them. Local voters are generally free to choose the basic
   framework of government from a selection established by state law.^[1]

   In most cases both counties and municipalities have a governing
   council, governing in conjunction with a mayor or president.
   Alternatively, the institution may be of the council-manager government
   form, run by a city manager under direction of the city council. In the
   past the municipal commission was also common.

   The ICMA has classified local governments into five common forms:
   mayor-council, council-manager, commission, town meeting, and
   representative town meeting.^[22]

   In addition to elections for a council or mayor, elections are often
   also held for positions such as local judges, the sheriff (head of the
   county's police department), and other offices (See City Councils
   Below)

City councils[edit]

   Most cities have city councils. These are sometimes elected officials
   who meet for a portion of the year on designated days and hours. City
   councils propose and make laws for the city. Many resemble what is done
   in congresses or parliaments around the world, except they are for the
   local levels. Some smaller cities or towns do not operate under city
   councils. In many cases city councils pass bills that can get vetoed by
   the mayor and the city council can override the veto. Sometimes the
   mayor is even a member or presiding officer of the council. Members of
   the council usually are a part of committees for the city they
   represent (e.g., parks and recreation, finance, etc.) There is a
   president and a president pro tempore in city councils. Usually the
   majority party (i.e., Democrat or Republican) has the president in
   their party. Each member is usually (in most cities) elected by the
   people of that city. The city is split into districts in which the
   councilman or councilwoman represents. On the first meeting of the
   session, the president is chosen. The president then chooses a
   president pro tempore among the other council members.

Indian reservations[edit]

   While their territory nominally falls within the boundaries of
   individual states, Indian reservations actually function outside of
   their control. The reservation is usually controlled by an elected
   tribal council which provides local services.

Census of local government[edit]

   A census of all local governments in the country is performed every 5
   years by the United States Census Bureau, in accordance with 13 USC
   161.

Examples in individual states[edit]

   The following sections provide details of the operation of local
   government in a selection of states, by way of example of the variety
   that exists across the country.

Alaska[edit]

   Alaska calls its county equivalents "boroughs," functioning similar to
   counties in the Lower 48; however, unlike any other state, not all of
   Alaska is subdivided into county-equivalent boroughs. Owing to the
   state's low population density, most of the land is contained in what
   the state terms the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has
   no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered
   directly by the state government. Many of Alaska's boroughs are
   consolidated city-borough governments; other cities exist both within
   organized boroughs and the Unorganized Borough.

California[edit]

   California has several different and overlapping forms of local
   government. Cities, counties, and the one consolidated city-county can
   make ordinances (local laws), including the establishment and
   enforcement of civil and criminal penalties.
   A city council meeting in Fullerton, California

   The entire state is subdivided into 58 counties (e.g., Los Angeles
   County). The only type of municipal entity is the city (e.g., Los
   Angeles), although cities may either operate under "general law" or a
   custom-drafted charter. California has never had villages, never really
   used townships (they were for surveying and judicial purposes only),
   and allows cities to call themselves "towns" if they wish, but the name
   "town" is purely cosmetic with no legal effect. As a result, California
   has several towns with large populations in the tens of thousands and
   several cities that are home to only a few hundred people.

   California cities are granted broad plenary powers under the California
   Constitution to assert jurisdiction over just about anything, and they
   cannot be abolished or merged without the consent of a majority of
   their inhabitants. For example, Los Angeles runs its own water and
   power utilities and its own elevator inspection department, while
   practically all other cities rely upon private utilities and the state
   elevator inspectors. San Francisco is unique in that it is the only
   consolidated city-county in the state.

   The city of Lakewood, California pioneered the Lakewood Plan, a
   contract under which a city reimburses a county for performing services
   which are more efficiently performed on a countywide basis. Such
   contracts have become very popular throughout California and many other
   states, as they enable city governments to concentrate on particular
   local concerns like zoning. A city which contracts out most of its
   services, particularly law enforcement, is known as a contract city.

   There are also thousands of "special districts", which are areas with a
   defined territory in which a specific service is provided, such as
   schools or fire stations. These entities lack plenary power to enact
   laws, but do have the power to promulgate administrative regulations
   that often carry the force of law within land directly controlled by
   such districts. Many special districts, particularly those created to
   provide public transportation or education, have their own police
   departments (e.g. Bay Area Rapid Transit District/BART Police and Los
   Angeles Unified School District/Los Angeles School Police Department).

District of Columbia[edit]

   The District of Columbia is unique within the United States in that it
   is under the direct authority of the U.S. Congress, rather than forming
   part of any state. Actual government has been delegated under the
   District of Columbia Home Rule Act to a city council which effectively
   also has the powers given to county or state governments in other
   areas. Under the act, the Council of the District of Columbia has the
   power to write laws, as a state's legislature would, moving the bill to
   the mayor to sign into law. Following this, the United States Congress
   has the power to overturn the law.

Georgia[edit]

   The state of Georgia is divided into 159 counties (the largest number
   of any state other than Texas), each of which has had home rule since
   at least 1980. This means that Georgia's counties not only act as units
   of state government, but also in much the same way as municipalities.

   All municipalities are classed as a "city", regardless of population
   size. For an area to be incorporated as a city special legislation has
   to be passed by the General Assembly (state legislature); typically the
   legislation requires a referendum amongst local voters to approve
   incorporation, to be passed by a simple majority. This most recently
   happened in 2005 and 2006 in several communities near Atlanta. Sandy
   Springs, a city of 85,000 bordering Atlanta to the north, incorporated
   in December 2005. One year later, Johns Creek (62,000) and Milton
   (20,000) incorporated, which meant that the entirety of north Fulton
   County was now municipalized. The General Assembly also approved a plan
   that would potentially establish two new cities in the remaining
   unincorporated portions of Fulton County south of Atlanta: South Fulton
   and Chattahoochee Hills. Chattahoochee Hills voted to incorporate in
   December 2007; South Fulton voted against incorporation, and is the
   only remaining unincorporated portion of Fulton County.

   City charters may be revoked either by the legislature or by a simple
   majority referendum of the city's residents; the latter last happened
   in 2004, in Lithia Springs. Revocation by the legislature last occurred
   in 1995, when dozens of cities were eliminated en masse for not having
   active governments, or even for not offering at least three municipal
   services required of all cities.

   New cities may not incorporate land less than 3 miles (4.8 km) from an
   existing city without approval from the General Assembly. The body
   approved all of the recent and upcoming creations of new cities in
   Fulton County.

   Four areas have a "consolidated city-county" government: Columbus,
   since 1971; Athens, since 1991; Augusta, since 1996; and Macon, which
   was approved by voters in 2012.

Hawaii[edit]

   Hawaii is the only U.S. state that has no incorporated municipalities.
   Instead it has four counties and the "consolidated city-county" of
   Honolulu. All communities are considered to be census-designated
   places, with the exact boundaries being decided upon by co-operative
   agreement between the Governor's office and the U.S. Census Bureau.

   Kalawao County is the second smallest county in the United States, and
   is often considered part of Maui County.

Louisiana[edit]

   In Louisiana, counties are called parishes; likewise, the county seat
   is known as the parish seat. The difference in nomenclature does not
   reflect a fundamental difference in the nature of government, but is
   rather a reflection of the state's unique status as a former Spanish
   colony (although a small number of other states once had parishes too).

Maryland[edit]

   Maryland has 23 counties. The State Constitution charters the City of
   Baltimore as an Independent City, which is the functional equivalent of
   a county, and is separate from any county, e.g., there is also a
   Baltimore County, but its county seat is in Towson, not in the City of
   Baltimore. Other than Baltimore, all cities are the same, and there is
   no difference between a municipality called a city or a town. Cities
   and towns are chartered by the legislature.

New York[edit]

   Main article: Administrative divisions of New York

Pennsylvania[edit]

   Pennsylvania has 67 counties. With the exception of Philadelphia and
   Allegheny, counties are governed by three to seven county commissioners
   who are elected every four years; the district attorney, county
   treasurer, sheriff, and certain classes of judge ("judges of election")
   are also elected separately. Philadelphia has been a consolidated
   city-county since 1952. Allegheny County has had a council/chief
   executive government since 1821, while still retaining its townships,
   boroughs and cities.

   Each county is divided into municipal corporations, which can be one of
   four types: cities, boroughs, townships, and incorporated towns. The
   Commonwealth does not contain any unincorporated land that is not
   served by a local government. However, the US Postal Service has given
   names to places within townships that are not incorporated separately.
   For instance King of Prussia is a census-designated place but has no
   local government of its own. It is rather contained within Upper Merion
   Township, governed by Upper Merion's commissioners, and considered to
   be a part of the township.

   Townships are divided into two classes, depending on their population
   size. Townships of the "First Class" have a board made up of five to
   nine commissioners who are elected either at-large or for a particular
   ward, while those of the "Second Class" have a board of three to five
   supervisors who are elected at-large. Both commissioners and
   supervisors serve a four-year term. Some townships have adopted a home
   rule charter which allows them to choose their form of government. One
   example is Upper Darby Township, in Delaware County, which has chosen
   to have a "mayor-council" system similar to that of a borough.

   Boroughs in Pennsylvania are governed by a "mayor-council" system in
   which the mayor has only a few powers (usually that of overseeing the
   municipal police department, if the borough has one), while the borough
   council has very broad appointment and oversight. The council
   president, who is elected by the majority party every two years, is
   equivalent to the leader of a council in the United Kingdom; his or her
   powers operate within boundaries set by the state constitution and the
   borough's charter. A small minority of the boroughs have dropped the
   mayor-council system in favor of the council-manager system, in which
   the council appoints a borough manager to oversee the day-to-day
   operations of the borough.

   Bloomsburg is the Commonwealth's only incorporated town. McCandless is
   also officially referred to as a town, but it was incorporated as a
   township and now operates under a Home Rule Municipality Charter.

   Cities in Pennsylvania are divided into four classes: Class 1, Class 2,
   Class 2A, and Class 3. Class 3 cities, which are the smallest, have
   either a mayor-council system or a council-manager system like that of
   a borough, although the mayor or city manager has more oversight and
   duties compared to their borough counterparts. Pittsburgh and Scranton
   are the state's only Class 2 and Class 2A cities respectively, and have
   mayors with some veto power, but are otherwise still governed mostly by
   their city councils.

   Philadelphia is the Commonwealth's only Class 1 city. It has a
   government similar to that of the Commonwealth itself, with a mayor
   with strong appointment and veto powers and a 15-member city council
   that has both law-making and confirmation powers, although unlike its
   state-level counterpart (the General Assembly), it does not have the
   authority to override the mayor's veto. Certain types of legislation
   that can be passed by the city government require state legislation
   before coming into force. Unlike the other cities in Pennsylvania, the
   Philadelphia city government also has oversight of county government,
   and as such controls the budget for the district attorney, sheriff, and
   other county offices that have been retained from the county's one-time
   separate existence; these offices are elected for separately than those
   for the city government proper.

Texas[edit]

   Texas has 254 counties, the most of any state.

   Each county is governed by a five-member Commissioners Court, which
   consists of a County Judge (elected at-large) and four Commissioners
   (elected from single-member precincts). The County Judge has no veto
   authority over the decisions of the Court, s/he has one vote along with
   the other Commissioners. In smaller counties, the County Judge also
   performs judicial functions, while in larger counties his/her role is
   limited to the Court. Elections are held on a partisan basis.

   Counties have no home rule authority; their authority is strictly
   limited by the State. They operate in areas which are considered
   "unincorporated" (those parts not within the territory of a city; Texas
   does not have townships) unless the city has contracted with the county
   for essential services. In plain English, Texas counties merely exist
   to deliver specific types of services at the local level as prescribed
   by state law, but cannot enact or enforce local ordinances.

   As one textbook produced for use in Texas schools has openly
   acknowledged, Texas counties are prone to inefficient operations and
   are vulnerable to corruption, for several reasons.^[23] First, most of
   them do not have a merit system but operate on a spoils system, so that
   many county employees obtain their positions through loyalty to a
   particular political party and commissioner rather than whether they
   actually have the skills and experience appropriate to their
   positions.^[23] Second, most counties have not centralized purchasing
   into a single procurement department which would be able to seek
   quantity discounts and carefully scrutinize bids and contract awards
   for unusual patterns.^[23] Third, in 90 percent of Texas counties, each
   commissioner is individually responsible for planning and executing
   their own road construction and maintenance program for their own
   precinct, which results in poor coordination and duplicate construction
   machinery.^[23]

   Cities may be either general law or home rule. Once a city reaches
   5,000 in population, it may submit a ballot petition to create a "city
   charter" and operate under home rule status (they will maintain that
   status even if the population falls under 5,000) and may choose its own
   form of government (weak or strong mayor-council, commission,
   council-manager). Cities under general law status have only those
   powers authorized by the State. Annexation policies are highly
   dependent on whether the city is general law (annexation can only occur
   with the consent of the landowners) or home rule (no consent is
   required, but if the city fails to provide essential services, the
   landowners can petition for de-annexation), and city boundaries can
   cross county ones. The city council can be elected either at-large or
   from single-member districts. Ballots are on a nonpartisan basis
   (though, generally, the political affiliation of the candidates is
   commonly known).

   With the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District, all
   1,000+ school districts in Texas are "independent" school districts.
   State law requires seven trustees, which can be elected either at-large
   or from single-member districts. Ballots are non-partisan. The Texas
   Education Agency has state authority to order consolidation of school
   districts, generally for repeated failing performance as was the case
   with the Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District.

   In addition, state law allows the creation of special districts, such
   as hospital districts or water supply districts.

   Texas does not provide for independent cities nor for consolidated
   city-county governments. However, local governments are free to enter
   into "interlocal agreements" with other ones, primarily for efficiency
   purposes (a common example is for cities and school districts in a
   county to contract with the county for property tax collection; thus,
   each resident receives only one property bill).

Virginia[edit]

   Main article: Political subdivisions of Virginia

   Virginia is divided into 95 counties and 39 cities. All cities are
   independent cities, which mean that they are separate from, and
   independent of, any county they may be near or within. Cities in
   Virginia thus are the equivalent of counties as they have no higher
   local government intervening between them and the state government. The
   equivalent in Virginia to what would normally be an incorporated city
   in any other state, e.g. a municipality subordinate to a county, is a
   town. For example, there is a County of Fairfax as well as a totally
   independent City of Fairfax, which technically is not part of Fairfax
   County even though the City of Fairfax is the County seat of Fairfax
   County. Within Fairfax County, however, is the incorporated town of
   Vienna, which is part of Fairfax County.

       fact that the king had transferred his immediate sovereignty over
