   The cuisine of the United States refers to food preparation originating
   from the United States of America. European colonization of the
   Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and
   cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding
   well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of
   immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich
   diversity in food preparation throughout the country.

History[edit]

Pre-Colonial cuisine[edit]

Seafood[edit]

   Seafood in the United States originated with the Native Americans, who
   often ate cod, lemon sole, flounder, herring, halibut, sturgeon, smelt,
   drum on the East Coast, and olachen and salmon on the West Coast. Whale
   was hunted by Native Americans off the Northwest coast, especially by
   the Makah, and used for their meat and oil.^[1] Seal and walrus were
   also eaten, in addition to eel from New York's Finger Lakes region.
   Catfish was also popular amongst native peoples, including the Modocs.
   Crustacean included shrimp, lobster, crayfish, and dungeness crabs in
   the Northwest and blue crabs in the East. Other shellfish include
   abalone and geoduck on the West Coast, while on the East Coast the surf
   clam, quahog, and the soft-shell clam. Oysters were eaten on both
   shores, as were mussels and periwinkles.^[2]

Cooking methods[edit]

   Blue crab was used on the eastern and southern coast of what is now the
   U.S. mainland.

   Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early
   American Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking
   methods to form the basis of American Cuisine. Grilling meats was
   common. Spit roasting over a pit fire was common as well. Vegetables,
   especially root vegetables were often cooked directly in the ashes of
   the fire. As early Native Americans lacked pottery that could be used
   directly over a fire, they developed a technique which has caused many
   anthropologists to call them "Stone Boilers". They would heat rocks
   directly in a fire and then add the bricks to a pot filled with water
   until it came to a boil so that it would cook the meat or vegetables in
   the boiling water. In what is now the Southwestern United States, they
   also created adobe ovens called hornos to bake items such as cornmeal
   breads, and in other parts of America, made ovens of dug pits. These
   pits were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers and
   then seaweed or corn husks placed on top to steam fish and shellfish as
   well as vegetables; potatoes would be added while still in-skin and
   corn while in-husk, this would later be referred to as a clambake by
   the colonists.^[3]

Colonial period[edit]

   Main article: Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies
   Map of the 13 American Colonies in 1775.

   When the colonists came to Virginia, Massachusetts, or any of the other
   English colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America, their
   initial attempts at survival included planting crops familiar to them
   from back home in England. In the same way, they farmed animals for
   clothing and meat in a similar fashion. Through hardships and eventual
   establishment of trade with Britain, the West Indies and other regions,
   the colonists were able to establish themselves in the American
   colonies with a cuisine similar to their previous British cuisine.
   There were some exceptions to the diet, such as local vegetation and
   animals, but the colonists attempted to use these items in the same
   fashion as they had their equivalents or ignore them entirely if they
   could. The manner of cooking for the American colonists followed along
   the line of British cookery up until the Revolution. The British
   sentiment followed in the cookbooks brought to the New World as
   well.^[4]

   There was a general disdain for French cookery, even with the French
   Huguenots in South Carolina and French-Canadians. One of the cookbooks
   that proliferated in the colonies was The Art of Cookery Made Plain and
   Easy written by Hannah Glasse, wrote of disdain for the French style of
   cookery, stating “the blind folly of this age that would rather be
   imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English
   cook!” Of the French recipes, she does add to the text she speaks out
   flagrantly against the dishes as she “… think it an odd jumble of
   trash.”^[5] Reinforcing the anti-French sentiment was the French and
   Indian War from 1754–1764. This created a large anxiety against the
   French, which influenced the English to either deport many of the
   French, or as in the case of many Acadians from Nova Scotia, they
   forcibly relocated to Louisiana. The Acadian French did create a large
   French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana, but had
   little or no influence outside of Louisiana - except among the Acadian
   Francophones who settled eastern Maine at the same time they colonised
   New Brunswick.^[6]

Common ingredients[edit]

   The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in
   which someone lived. Local cuisine patterns had established by the
   mid-18th century. The New England colonies were extremely similar in
   their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from
   England. A striking difference for the colonists in New England
   compared to other regions was seasonality.^[7] While in the southern
   colonies, they could farm almost year round, in the northern colonies,
   the growing seasons were very restricted. In addition, colonists’ close
   proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their
   diet, especially in the northern colonies. Wheat, however, the grain
   used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow, and
   imports of wheat were far from cost productive.^[8] Substitutes in
   cases such as this included cornmeal. The Johnnycake was a poor
   substitute to some for wheaten bread, but acceptance by both the
   northern and southern colonies seems evident.^[9]

   As many of the New Englanders were originally from England game hunting
   was often a pastime from back home that paid off when they immigrated
   to the New World. Much of the northern colonists depended upon the
   ability either of themselves to hunt, or for others from which they
   could purchase game. This was the preferred method for protein
   consumption over animal husbandry, as it required much more work to
   defend the kept animals against Native Americans or the French.

Livestock and game[edit]

   Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo and wild turkey. The
   larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant
   sauce, while the other smaller portions went into soups, stews,
   sausages, pies, and pasties.^[10] In addition to game, colonists'
   protein intake was supplemented by mutton. The Spanish in Florida
   originally introduced sheep to the New World, but this development
   never quite reached the North, and there they were introduced by the
   Dutch and English. The keeping of sheep was a result of the English
   non-practice of animal husbandry.^[11] The animals provided wool when
   young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer
   desirable.^[12] The forage-based diet for sheep that prevailed in the
   Colonies produced a characteristically strong, gamy flavor and a
   tougher consistency, which required aging and slow cooking to
   tenderize.^[13]

Fats and oils[edit]

   A number of fats and oils made from animals served to cook much of the
   colonial foods. Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear
   oil for cooking, while solidified bear fat resembled shortening.
   Rendered pork fat made the most popular cooking medium, especially from
   the cooking of bacon. Pork fat was used more often in the southern
   colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs
   earlier to the South. The colonists enjoyed butter in cooking as well,
   but it was rare prior to the American Revolution, as cattle were not
   yet plentiful.^[14]

Alcoholic drinks[edit]

   Prior to the Revolution, New Englanders consumed large quantities of
   rum and beer, as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to
   the goods needed to produce these items: Rum was the distilled spirit
   of choice, as the main ingredient, molasses, was readily available from
   trade with the West Indies. Further into the interior, however, one
   would often find colonists consuming whiskey, as they did not have
   similar access to sugar cane. They did have ready access to corn and
   rye, which they used to produce their whiskey.^[15] However, until the
   Revolution, many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for
   human consumption, as many believed that it caused the poor to become
   raucous and unkempt drunkards.^[16] In addition to these alcohol-based
   products produced in America, imports were seen on merchant shelves,
   including wine and brandy.^[17]

Southern variations[edit]

   In comparison to the northern colonies, the southern colonies were
   quite diverse in their agricultural diet and did not have a central
   region of culture. The uplands and the lowlands made up the two main
   parts of the southern colonies. The slaves and poor of the south often
   ate a similar diet, which consisted of many of the indigenous New World
   crops. Salted or smoked pork often supplement the vegetable diet. Rural
   poor often ate squirrel, possum, rabbit and other woodland animals.
   Those on the “rice coast” often ate ample amounts of rice, while the
   grain for the rest of the southern poor and slaves was cornmeal used in
   breads and porridges. Wheat was not an option for most of those that
   lived in the southern colonies.^[18]

   The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white
   potatoes, while most avoided sweet potatoes and peanuts. Well-off
   whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because of the
   perceived inferiority of crops of the African slaves. Those who could
   grow or afford wheat often had biscuits as part of their breakfast,
   along with healthy portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any
   meal, as it was used in the preparations of vegetables for flavor, in
   addition to being eaten directly as a protein.^[19]

   The lowlands, which included much of the Acadian French regions of
   Louisiana and the surrounding area, included a varied diet heavily
   influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, rather than just the French. As
   such, rice played a large part of the diet as it played a large part of
   the diets of the Africans and Caribbean. In addition, unlike the
   uplands, the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal
   seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers,
   as it still does today.^[20] Interestingly, although the English had an
   inherent disdain for French foodways, as well as many of the native
   foodstuff of the colonies, the French had no such disdain for the
   indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they had a vast appreciation for the
   native ingredients and dishes.^[21]

Post-colonial cuisine[edit]

   During the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans developed many new foods.
   Some, such as Rocky Mountain oysters, stayed regional; some spread
   throughout the nation but with little international appeal, such as
   peanut butter (a core ingredient of the famous peanut butter and jelly
   sandwich); and some spread throughout the world, such as popcorn,
   Coca-Cola and its competitors, fried chicken, cornbread, unleavened
   muffins such as the poppyseed muffin, and brownies.

Modern cuisine[edit]

   A restaurant dish consisting of smaller versions of three different
   hamburgers available in the restaurant, each with different toppings,
   accompanied with French fries, coleslaw, jalapeños, ketchup and sweet
   chili sauce.

   During the Progressive Era (1890s–1920s) food production and
   presentation became more industrialized. Major railroads featured
   upscale cuisine in their dining cars.^[22] Restaurant chains emerged
   with standardized decor and menus, most famously the Fred Harvey
   restaurants along the route of the Sante Fe Railroad in the
   Southwest.^[23]

   At the universities, nutritionists and home economists taught a new
   scientific approach to food. During World War I the Progressives' moral
   advice about food conservation was emphasized in large-scale state and
   federal programs designed to educate housewives. Large-scale foreign
   aid during and after the war brought American standards to Europe.^[24]

   Newspapers and magazines ran recipe columns, aided by research by
   corporate kitchens (for example, General Mills, Campbell's, Kraft
   Foods). One characteristic of American cooking is the fusion of
   multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking
   styles. Hamburgers and hot dogs from German cuisine, spaghetti and
   pizza from Italian cuisine became popular. Since the 1960s Asian
   cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion
   cuisine.^[25]
   An American hot dog

   Similarly, some dishes that are typically considered American have
   their origins in other countries. American cooks and chefs have
   substantially altered these dishes over the years, to the degree that
   the dishes now enjoyed around the world are considered to be American.
   Hot dogs and hamburgers are both based on traditional German dishes,
   but in their modern popular form they can be reasonably considered
   American dishes.^[26]

   Pizza is based on the traditional Italian dish, brought by Italian
   immigrants to the United States, but varies highly in style based on
   the region of development since its arrival (a "Chicago" style has
   focus on a thicker, more bread-like crust, whereas a "New York Slice"
   is known to have a much thinner crust, for example) and these types can
   be advertised throughout the country and are generally
   recognizable/well-known (with some restaurants going so far as to
   import New York City tap water from a thousand or more miles away to
   recreate the signature style in other regions).^[27]

   Many companies in the American food industry develop new products
   requiring minimal preparation, such as frozen entrees.^[28] Many of
   these recipes have become very popular. For example, the General Mills
   Betty Crocker's Cookbook, first published in 1950 and currently in its
   10th edition,^[29] is commonly found in American homes.^[30]

   A wave of celebrity chefs began with Julia Child and Graham Kerr in the
   1970s, with many more following after the rise of cable channels like
   Food Network. Trendy food items in the 2000s and 2010s (albeit with
   long traditions) include doughnuts, cupcakes, macaroons, and
   meatballs.^[31]

New American[edit]

   Main article: New American cuisine

   During the 1980s, upscale restaurants introduced a mixing of cuisines
   that contain Americanized styles of cooking with foreign elements
   commonly referred as New American cuisine.^[32]

Regional cuisines[edit]

   Main article: List of American regional and fusion cuisines

   Given the United States's large size, numerous regions each have their
   own distinctive cuisines, all quite diverse.

New England[edit]

   Main article: Cuisine of New England
   New England clam chowder

   New England is a Northeastern region of the United States, including
   the six states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
   Rhode Island, and Vermont. The Native American cuisine became part of
   the cookery style that the early colonists brought with them.^[citation
   needed] The style of New England cookery originated from its colonial
   roots, that is to say practical, frugal and willing to eat anything
   other than what they were used to from their British roots.^[33] Much
   of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such
   dishes as succotash, chowder, baked beans, and others.^[34]

   Lobster is an integral ingredient to the cuisine, indigenous to the
   coastal waters of the region. Other shellfish of the coastal regions
   include little neck clams, sea scallops, blue mussels, oysters, soft
   shell clams and razor shell clams. Much of this shellfish contributes
   to New England tradition, the clambake. The clambake as known today is
   a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition.^[35]

   The fruits of the region include the Vitis labrusca grapes used in
   grape juice made by companies such as Welch's, along with jelly, Kosher
   wine by companies like Mogen David and Manischewitz along with other
   wineries that make higher quality wines. Apples from New England
   include the original varieties Baldwin, Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise,
   Porter, Roxbury Russet, Wright, Sops of Wine, Peck's Pleasant, Titus
   Pippin, Westfield-Seek-No-Further, and Duchess of Oldenburg.
   Cranberries are another fruit indigenous to the region.^[36]

Pacific and Hawaiian cuisine[edit]

   Main article: Cuisine of Hawaii
   Hawaiian cuisine: Seared ahi with wasabi beurre blanc sauce

   Hawaii is often considered to be one of the most culturally diverse
   U.S. states, as well as being the only state with an Asian majority
   population. As a result, Hawaiian cuisine borrows elements of a variety
   of cuisines, particularly those of Asian and Pacific-rim cultures, as
   well as traditional native Hawaiian. Some notable Hawaiian fare
   includes seared ahi tuna, opakapaka (snapper) with passionfruit,
   Hawaiian island-raised lamb, beef and meat products, Hawaiian plate
   lunch, and Molokai shrimp and seafood caught fresh in Hawaiian waters.
   Some cuisine also incorporates a broad variety of produce and locally
   grown agricultural products, including tomatoes, strawberries,
   mushrooms, sweet maui onions, and tropical fruits including papayas,
   mangoes, lilikoi (passionfruit) and lychee.

Midwest[edit]

   Main article: Cuisine of the Midwestern United States

   Midwestern cuisine covers everything from barbecue to the Chicago-style
   hot dog.

The American South[edit]

   Main article: Cuisine of the Southern United States
   Fried chicken

   The cuisine of the American South has been influenced by the many
   diverse inhabitants of the region, including Americans of European
   descent, Native Americans and African Americans. The cuisine of the
   American South, along with the rest of its culture, is one of the most
   distinct in all of the country.

Cuisine in the West[edit]

   Main article: Cuisine of the Western United States

   Cooking in the American West gets its influence from Native American
   and Mexican cultures, and other European settlers into the part of the
   country. Common dishes vary depending on the area. For instance, the
   Northwest relies on local seafood, while in the Southwest, Mexican
   flavors are extremely common.

Common dishes found on a regional level[edit]

   The demand for ethnic foods in the United States reflects the nation's
   changing diversity as well as its development over time. According to
   the National Restaurant Association,

     Restaurant industry sales are expected to reach a record high of
     $476 billion in 2005, an increase of 4.9 percent over 2004... Driven
     by consumer demand, the ethnic food market reached record sales in
     2002, and has emerged as the fastest growing category in the food
     and beverage product sector, according to USBX Advisory Services.
     Minorities in the U.S. spend a combined $142 billion on food and by
     2010, America's ethnic population is expected to grow by 40
     percent.^[37]

   A movement began during the 1980s among popular leading chefs to
   reclaim America's ethnic foods within its regional traditions, where
   these trends originated. One of the earliest was Paul Prudhomme, who in
   1984 began the introduction of his influential cookbook, Paul
   Prodhomme's Louisiana Kitchen, by describing the over 200 year history
   of Creole and Cajun cooking; he aims to "preserve and expand the
   Louisiana tradition."^[38] Prodhomme's success quickly inspired other
   chefs. Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with
   many ethnic and globalized elements in his Feast of Sunlight cookbook
   in 1988. The movement finally gained fame around the world when
   California became swept up in the movement, then seemingly started to
   lead the trend itself, in, for example, the popular restaurant Chez
   Panisse in Berkeley. Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon, chefs who
   embraced a new globalized cuisine, were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah
   Tower and Wolfgang Puck, both former colleagues at the restaurant. Puck
   went on to describe his belief in contemporary, new style American
   cuisine in the introduction to The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook:

     Another major breakthrough, whose originators were once thought to
     be crazy, is the mixing of ethnic cuisines. It is not at all
     uncommon to find raw fish listed next to tortillas on the same menu.
     Ethnic crossovers also occur when distinct elements meet in a single
     recipe. This country is, after all, a huge melting pot. Why should
     its cooking not illustrate the American transformation of diversity
     into unity?^[39]

   Puck's former colleague, Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with
   California Cuisine and the overall American culinary revolution.
   Meanwhile, the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a
   distinguished establishment, popularizing its so called "mantra" in its
   book by Paul Bertolli and owner Alice Waters, Chez Panisse Cooking, in
   1988. Published well after the restaurants' founding in 1971, this new
   cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy
   that had developed over the years. The book embraced America's natural
   bounty, specifically that of California, while containing recipes that
   reflected Bertoli and Waters' appreciation of both northern Italian and
   French style foods.

Early ethnic influences[edit]

   Adaptation of Mexican food tailored for the mainstream American market
   usually is very different from Mexican food typically served in Mexico
   itself.

   While the earliest cuisine of the United States was influenced by
   indigenous Native Americans, the cuisine of the thirteen colonies or
   the culture of the antebellum American South; the overall culture of
   the nation, its gastronomy and the growing culinary arts became ever
   more influenced by its changing ethnic mix and immigrant patterns from
   the 18th and 19th centuries unto the present. Some of the ethnic groups
   that continued to influence the cuisine were here in prior years; while
   others arrived more numerously during “The Great Transatlantic
   Migration (of 1870—1914) or other mass migrations.

   Some of the ethnic influences could be found in the nation from after
   the American Civil War and into the History of United States
   continental expansion during most of the 19th century. Ethnic
   influences already in the nation at that time would include the
   following groups and their respective cuisines:
     * Select nationalities of Europe and the respective developments from
       early modern European cuisine of the colonial age:
          + British-Americans and on-going developments in New England
            cuisine, the national traditions founded in cuisine of the
            thirteen colonies and some aspects of other regional cuisine.
          + Spanish Americans and early modern Spanish cuisine, as well as
            Basque-Americans and Basque cuisine.
          + Early German-American or Pennsylvania Dutch and Pennsylvania
            Dutch cuisine
          + French Americans and their "New World" regional identities
            such as:
               o Acadian
               o Cajun and Cajun cuisine
          + Louisiana Creole and Louisiana Creole cuisine. Louisiana
            Creole (also called French Créole) refers to native born
            people of the New Orleans area who are descended from the
            Colonial French and/or Spanish settlers of Colonial French
            Louisiana, before it became part of the United States in 1803
            with the Louisiana Purchase.
     * The various ethnicities originating from early social factors of
       Race in the United States and the gastronomy and cuisines of the
       “New World,” Latin American cuisine and North American cuisine:
          + Indigenous Native Americans in the United States and American
            Indian cuisine
          + African-Americans and “Soul food.”
          + Cuisine of Puerto Rico
          + Mexican-Americans and Mexican-American cuisine; as well as
            related regional cuisines:
               o Tex-Mex (regional Texas and Mexican fusion)
               o Cal-Mex (regional California and Mexican fusion)
               o Some aspects of “Southwestern cuisine.”
          + Cuisine of New Mexico

   Mass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several
   waves. Historians identify several waves of migration to the United
   States: one from 1815–1860, in which some five million English, Irish,
   Germanic, Scandinavian, and others from northwestern Europe came to the
   United States; one from 1865–1890, in which some 10 million immigrants,
   also mainly from northwestern Europe, settled, and a third from
   1890–1914, in which 15 million immigrants, mainly from central,
   eastern, and southern Europe (many Austrian, Hungarian, Turkish,
   Lithuanian, Russian, Jewish, Greek, Italian, and Romanian) settled in
   the United States.^[40]

   Together with earlier arrivals to the United States (including the
   indigenous Native Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans,
   particularly in the West, Southwest, and Texas; African Americans who
   came to the United States in the Atlantic slave trade; and early
   colonial migrants from Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere),
   these new waves of immigrants had a profound impact on national or
   regional cuisine. Some of these more prominent groups include the
   following:
     * Arab Americans, particularly Lebanese Americans (the largest ethnic
       Arab group in the United States) – Arab cuisine, Lebanese cuisine
     * Chinese Americans – American Chinese cuisine, Chinese cuisine
     * Cuban Americans – Cuban cuisine
     * German Americans – German cuisine (the Pennsylvania Dutch, although
       descended from Germans, arrived earlier than the bulk of German
       migrants and have distinct culinary traditions)
     * Greek Americans – Greek American cuisine, Greek cuisine,
       Mediterranean cuisine
     * Indian Americans – Indian cuisine
     * Irish Americans – Irish cuisine
     * Italian Americans – Italian-American cuisine, Italian cuisine
     * Japanese Americans – Japanese cuisine, with influences on the
       Hawaiian cuisine
     * Jewish Americans – Jewish cuisine, with particular influence on New
       York City cuisine
     * Lithuanian Americans – Lithuanian cuisine, Midwest
     * Nicaraguan American-Nicaraguan cuisine
     * Pakistani Americans – Pakistani cuisine
     * Polish Americans – Polish cuisine, with particular impact on
       Midwest
     * Polynesian Americans – Hawaiian cuisine
     * Portuguese Americans – Portuguese cuisine
     * Romanian Americans – Romanian cuisine
     * Russian Americans – Russian cuisine, with particular impact on
       Midwest
     * Salvadoran Americans – Salvadoran cuisine
     * Scottish Americans – Scottish cuisine
     * Turkish Americans - Turkish cuisine, Balkan cuisine
     * Vietnamese Americans – Vietnamese cuisine
     * West Indian Americans – Caribbean cuisine, Jamaican cuisine

     "Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) cuisines have indeed
     joined the mainstream. These three cuisines have become so ingrained
     in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the
     American palate. According to the study, more than nine out of 10
     consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods, and about
     half report eating them frequently. The research also indicates that
     Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) have become so adapted to
     such an extent that "authenticity" is no longer a concern to
     customers."^[41]

   Contributions from these ethnic foods have become as common as
   traditional "American" fares such as hot dogs, hamburgers, beef steak,
   which are derived from German cuisine, (chicken-fried steak, for
   example, is a variation on German schnitzel), cherry pie, Coca-Cola,
   milkshakes, fried chicken (Fried chicken is of Scottish and African
   influence) and so on. Nowadays, Americans also have a ubiquitous
   consumption of foods like pizza and pasta, tacos and burritos to
   "General Tso's chicken" and fortune cookies. Fascination with these and
   other ethnic foods may also vary with region.

Notable American chefs[edit]

   See also: List of chefs

   American chefs have been influential both in the food industry and in
   popular culture. An important 19th Century American chef was Charles
   Ranhofer of Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City. American cooking
   has been exported around the world, both through the global expansion
   of restaurant chains such as T.G.I. Friday's and McDonald's and the
   efforts of individual restaurateurs such as Bob Payton, credited with
   bringing American-style pizza to the UK.^[42]

   The first generation of television chefs such as Robert Carrier and
   Julia Child tended to concentrate on cooking based primarily on
   European, especially French and Italian, cuisines. Only during the
   1970s and 1980s did television chefs such as James Beard and Jeff Smith
   shift the focus towards home-grown cooking styles, particularly those
   of the different ethnic groups within the nation. Notable American
   restaurant chefs include Thomas Keller, Charlie Trotter, Grant Achatz,
   Alfred Portale, Paul Prudhomme, Paul Bertolli, Frank Stitt, Alice
   Waters, Patrick O’Connell and celebrity chefs like Mario Batali, David
   Chang, Alton Brown, Emeril Lagasse, Cat Cora, Michael Symon, Bobby
   Flay, Ina Garten, Todd English, Sandra Lee, Anthony Bourdain, and Paula
   Deen.

   Regional chefs are emerging as localized celebrity chefs with growing
   broader appeal, such as Peter Merriman (Hawaii Regional Cuisine), Jerry
   Traunfeld, Alan Wong (Pacific Rim cuisine), Norman Van Aken (New World
   Cuisine – fusion Latin, Caribbean, Asian, African and American), and
   Mark Miller (American Southwest cuisine).
