   Varies by state. (see below)
   Federal hate-crime law includes sexual orientation and gender identity
   since 2009
   Federal executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual
   orientation for employees in the federal civilian workforce, along with
   the government employment in the District of Columbia, and the United
   States Postal Service, since 1998 (see Executive Order 13087).
   Family rights
   Recognition of
   relationships Same-sex unions recognized federally, varies by state

                                                             Restrictions:

   Defense of Marriage Act (1996) at federal level - Section 3 of the
   Defense of Marriage Act invalidated June 26, 2013 (United States v.
   Windsor), other restrictions vary by state
   Adoption Varies by state

   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in the United
   States have evolved over time and vary greatly on a state-by-state
   basis.

   Sexual activity between consenting adults and adolescents of a close
   age of the same sex has been legal nationwide since 2003, pursuant to
   the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas. Age of consent in
   each state varies from age 16 to 18;^[1] some states maintain different
   ages of consent for males/females or same-sex/opposite-sex relations.

   LGBT rights related laws including family, marriage, and
   anti-discrimination laws vary by state. Nineteen states plus
   Washington, D.C. offer marriage to same-sex couples; these marriages
   are recognized by the federal government, but not by most other
   states.^[2] Additionally, some states offer civil unions or other types
   of recognition which offer some of the legal benefits and protections
   of marriage.

   Twenty-one states plus Washington, D.C and Puerto Rico outlaw
   discrimination based on sexual orientation, and seventeen states plus
   Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico outlaw discrimination based on gender
   identity or expression.^[3] Hate crimes based on sexual orientation or
   gender identity are also punishable by federal law under the Matthew
   Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. In 2011
   and 2012, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that job
   discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
   individuals classified as a form of sex discrimination and thus
   violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.^[4]

   Adoption policies in regard to gay and lesbian parents also vary
   greatly from state to state. Some allow adoption by same-sex couples,
   while others ban all unmarried couples from adoption.^[5]

   Civil rights for LGBT people in the United States are advocated by a
   variety of organizations at all levels and concentrations of political
   and legal life, including the Human Rights Campaign,^[6] Lambda Legal,
   Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), American Civil Liberties
   Union (ACLU), and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

Judicial history[edit]

State Supreme Court Decisions[edit]

   In 1972, the Supreme Court of Minnesota in Baker v. Nelson ruled that a
   state's denial of a civil marriage license to a same-sex couple did not
   violate the U.S. Constitution. In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled
   that the state constitution's ban on sex discrimination entitled a
   same-sex couple to a civil marriage license unless the state could
   prove it had a "compelling state interest" for denying such a
   license.^[7] A lower court in Hawaii then found that the state had
   failed to show such a compelling interest,^[8] and same-sex marriage
   was legal in Hawaii for a day, before the judge stayed his ruling.
   Hawaii amended its constitution in 1998 to allow the legislature to
   restrict marriage to different-sex couples.

   Five state Supreme Court decisions have legalized same sex marriage in
   five US states:
   Main article: Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts
     * On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in
       Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that gay and lesbian
       couples could not be denied the right to marry because of the Equal
       Protection Clause of the state constitution. Same sex marriage
       became legal in Massachusetts on May 17, 2004.

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in California
     * On May 15, 2008 the California Supreme Court ruled in In re
       Marriage Cases overturned Proposition 22, declared the stature
       banning same sex marriage was unconstitutional and gay and lesbian
       couples could not be denied the right to marry because of the Equal
       Protection Clause of the state constitution. Same sex marriage
       became legal in California on June 16, 2008 . On November 5, 2008
       Proposition 8, a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage,
       overturned the Supreme Court decision legalizing same sex marriage
       but this was itself overturned by Judge Vaughn Walker in Perry v.
       Brown and ruled unconstitutional because of the state's Equal
       Protection Clause on August 4, 2010. This was upheld on February 7,
       2012 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
       and was heard by the United States Supreme Court in June 2013 with
       the same results.

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in Connecticut
     * On October 10, 2008 the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in Kerrigan
       v. Commissioner of Public Health that gay and lesbian couples could
       not be denied the right to marry because of the Equal Protection
       Clause of the state constitution. Same sex marriage became legal in
       Connecticut on November 14, 2008.

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in Iowa
     * On April 3, 2009 the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in Varnum v. Brien
       that gay and lesbian couples could not be denied the right to marry
       because of the Equal Protection Clause of the state constitution.
       Same sex marriage became legal on April 26, 2009 in Iowa.

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in New Mexico
     * On December 19, 2013 the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in Griego
       v. Oliver that marriage licenses must be issued to couples
       regardless of gender. Same-sex marriage became legal on December
       19, 2013.

   Two state Supreme Court decisions have legalized civil unions in two US
   states:
   Main article: Same-sex marriage in Vermont § Civil union
     * On December 20, 1999 the Supreme Court of Vermont ruled in Baker v.
       Vermont that same-sex marriage or something similar must be
       implemented in 100 days. The Vermont state legislators choose civil
       unions. Civil unions became legal in Vermont on July 1, 2000.

   Main article: Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey
     * On October 25, 2006 the Supreme Court of New Jersey ruled in Lewis
       v. Harris same-sex marriage or something similar must be
       implemented in 100 days. The New Jersey state legislators choose
       civil unions. Civil unions became legal in New Jersey on February
       19, 2007.

   Two state Supreme Court decisions have allowed same sex couples to
   adopt:
   Main article: LGBT rights in Florida § Adoption
     * On September 22, 2010 the Supreme Court of Florida ruled in In re:
       Gill that the 1977 ban on homosexuals adopting children in Florida
       was unconstitutional allowing same sex couples to adopt children in
       Florida.

   Main article: LGBT rights in Arkansas § Adoption and parenting
     * On April 7, 2011 the Supreme Court of Arkansas ruled in Arkansas
       Department of Human Services v. Cole that the Arkansas Proposed
       Initiative Act No. 1 that banned non-married couples from adopting
       children was unconstitutional allowing same sex couples to adopt
       children in Arkansas.

   Many states recognize through their judicial systems cohabitation
   agreements and common law partner agreements concluded between two
   partners in a relationship. These are de facto domestic partnerships
   that protect both parties and allow for shared property and court
   recognition of their relationships.^[9]^[9]

United States Supreme Court decisions[edit]

   US sodomy laws by the year when they were repealed or struck down.
   Sodomy laws remaining as of 2003 were struck down by the U.S. Supreme
   Court in Lawrence v. Texas
     Laws repealed or struck down before 1970.
     Laws repealed or struck down from 1970-1979.
     Laws repealed or struck down from 1980-1989.
     Laws repealed or struck down from 1990-1999.
     Laws repealed or struck down from 2000-2002.
     Laws struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2003.

   In March 1956, a Federal District Court ruled that ONE: The Homosexual
   Magazine, was obscene under the Federal Comstock laws and thus could
   not be sent through the United States Postal Service. This ruling was
   upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but in 1958, the Supreme
   Court of the United States issued a landmark ruling in One, Inc. v.
   Olesen, 355 U.S. 371, which overturned the previous rulings under a new
   legal precedent that had been established by the landmark case, Roth v.
   United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957). As a result, gay newspapers,
   magazines and other publications could be lawfully distributed through
   the public mail service. On May 22, 1967, the Supreme Court of the
   United States upheld the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which
   among other things banned homosexuals, as constitutional. This ban
   remained in effect until 1991.^[10]

   In 1972, a Tacoma, Washington teacher of twelve years with a perfect
   record was terminated after a former student outed him to the
   vice-principal. The Washington Supreme Court found that homosexuality
   was immoral and impaired his efficiency as a teacher. The court
   supported its conclusion in various ways, including the definition of
   homosexuality in the New Catholic Encyclopedia, the criminal nature of
   homosexual conduct, and finding that an "immoral" person could not be
   trusted to instruct students as his presence would be inherently
   disruptive. On October 3, 1977, the United States Supreme Court denied
   certiorari, although Justices Brennan and Marshall would have granted
   cert. This was the first homosexual discrimination decision to be aired
   on national network news. In fact, it was simultaneously aired on all
   three national network evening news shows, reaching approximately 60
   million viewers.^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]

   In 1985, the Supreme Court heard Board of Education v. National Gay
   Task Force, which concerned First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges
   against a law that allowed schools to fire teachers for public
   homosexual conduct.^[16] The Court affirmed, by an equally divided
   vote, the Tenth Circuit's ruling that partially struck down the
   law.^[17]^[18]

   Also in 1985, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of Gay
   Student Services v. Texas A&M University, letting stand an appellate
   ruling ordering the university to provide official recognition of a
   student organization for homosexual students. The case set a national
   precedent by removing legal restrictions against gay rights groups on
   college campuses.^[19]

   On June 30, 1986, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in
   Bowers v. Hardwick, that homosexual sex was not protected under the
   right to privacy.

   On May 20, 1996, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Romer
   v. Evans against an amendment to the Colorado state constitution that
   would have prevented any city, town or county in the state from taking
   any legislative, executive, or judicial action to protect homosexual or
   bisexual citizens from discrimination on the basis of their sexual
   orientation.

   On March 4, 1998, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in
   Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services that federal laws banning
   on-the-job sexual harassment also applied when both parties are the
   same sex. The lower courts, however, have reached differing conclusions
   about whether this ruling applies to harassment motivated by anti-gay
   animus.

   On June 28, 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the
   Boy Scouts of America had a First Amendment right to exclude people
   from its organization on the basis of sexual orientation, irrespective
   of any applicable civil rights laws.

   On June 26, 2003, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence v.
   Texas that intimate consensual sexual conduct is part of the liberty
   protected by substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
   The majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, explicitly
   overruled Bowers v. Hardwick.^[20] Despite this ruling, some states
   have not repealed their sodomy laws^[21] and local law enforcement
   officers have used these statutes to harass or arrest gay
   people.^[22]^[23]^[24]

   Ten years after the Lawrence v. Texas decision, the Supreme Court ruled
   on June 26, 2013 that section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act is
   unconstitutional "as a deprivation of the equal liberty of the person
   ... protected by the Fifth Amendment". United States v. Windsor, the
   title of the landmark case, was decided by a 5 to 4 vote. The federal
   government is required to recognize marriages performed in states where
   same-sex marriage has been legalized, and provide federal rights,
   privileges and benefits.^[25]^[26]

United States Court of Appeals Decision[edit]

   On June 25, 2014, the Federal Tenth Circuit Court upheld the Utah
   Federal District Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutional the
   Utah state-constitutional ban of same sex marriage, and the legislative
   acts to deny any benefits to such married couples.^[27]

     We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right
     to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full
     protection of a state’s marital laws...A state may not deny the
     issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to
     recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons
     in the marriage union.
     For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.

   Since the DOMA decision, on June 26, 2013, all federal judges, who have
   handed down decisions on the constitutionality of gay marriage bans,
   and unanimously declared them unconstitutional. This decision is the
   first to break that unanimity. One of the three Federal Court judges on
   the appeals panel, sided with the defendants, and declared the Utah ban
   of gay marriage to be constitutional.

   Judge Paul Joseph Kelly, Jr. wrote in dissent

     I disagree with this court’s conclusions that (1) Baker v. Nelson,
     409 U.S. 810 (1972), need not be followed and that (2) the liberty
     guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment includes a fundamental right
     which requires Utah to extend marriage to same-gender couples and
     recognize same-gender marriages from other states. Because I
     conclude that there is no such fundamental right, it is unnecessary
     to consider whether Utah’s justifications for retaining its
     repeatedly-enacted concept of marriage pass heightened scrutiny. In
     my view, the provisions should be analyzed under traditional equal
     protection analysis and upheld as rationally related to (1)
     responsible procreation, (2) effective parenting, and (3) the desire
     to proceed cautiously in this evolving area.

   All of the other federal judges, who have issued decisions on this
   issue, have rejected all of his legal conclusions.

United States District Court Decisions[edit]

   By July 1, 2014, ten separate Federal District Court cases had been
   decided, after the Supreme Court's DOMA decision. All of these
   decisions are unanimous in finding that bans of gay marriage violate
   due process and equal protection and were therefore unconstitutional.
   Decisions were rendered in Idaho,^[28] Indiana,^[29] Kentucky,
   Michigan,^[30] Pennsylvania,^[31] Oklahoma,^[32] Oregon,^[33]
   Texas,^[34] Utah,^[35] Virginia,^[36] and Wisconsin^[37] These
   decisions were also unanimous in deciding that the Supreme Court
   decision in Baker v. Nelson (see above) no longer applies.^[31] U.S.
   District Judge John E. Jones, III ruled, in the Pennsylvania decision,
   that^[31]^:13

     "we, and our sister district courts that have examined precisely
     this same issue, no longer consider Baker v. Nelson controlling due
     to the significant doctrinal developments in the four decades that
     have elapsed since it was announced by the Supreme Court.
     determination, which has been resoundingly echoed by our sister
     district courts which have considered, and rejected, Baker’s
     precedential value in light of doctrinal developments in the areas
     of constitutional due process and equal protection."

   Candy Wagahoff Dale, Chief United States Magistrate Judge of the United
   States District Court for the District of Idaho ruled,^[28]^:12

     "The Supreme Court’s marriage cases recognize an individual’s
     fundamental right to marry. The right transcends one’s race,
     confinement to prison, or ability to support children. Lawrence
     unequivocally cements marriage as among the constitutionally
     protected liberties shared by homosexual and heterosexual persons
     alike. The teaching of these cases is that the fundamental right to
     marry cannot be narrowed..."

   Judge Jones' decision also said,^[31]^:39

     "The issue we resolve today is a divisive one. Some of our citizens
     are made deeply uncomfortable by the notion of same-sex marriage.
     However, that same sex marriage causes discomfort in some does not
     make its prohibition constitutional. Nor can past tradition trump
     the bedrock constitutional guarantees of due process and equal
     protection. Were that not so, ours would still be a racially
     segregated nation according to the now rightfully discarded doctrine
     of 'separate but equal.' ... In the sixty years since Brown was
     decided, 'separate' has thankfully faded into history, and only
     'equal' remains. Similarly, in future generations the label same-sex
     marriage will be abandoned, to be replaced simply by marriage.

     We are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is
     time to discard them into the ash heap of history.

   The June 6, 2014, opinion and order, of Judge Crabb said,^[37]^:4

     this case is about liberty and equality, the two cornerstones of the
     rights protected by the United States Constitution.
     ...the parties in this case...agree about...the central role that
     marriage plays in American society. It is a defining rite of
     passage...the most important for some. ...by refusing to extend
     marriage to the plaintiffs..., defendants are...denying equal
     citizenship to plaintiffs.

Legislative history[edit]

   Since the turn of the century there was a strong push to enact specific
   legislation, or state constitutional amendments, either legalizing gay
   marriage, or banning it in nearly every state. As of June 1, 2014, the
   situation is fluid. In several states petitions are being circulated to
   place the issue on the November 2014 ballot. In every state with a ban
   there is a federal court case challenging the constitutionality of the
   ban.^[38]

Legislative history of same-sex marriage[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States

   Nine states and the District of Columbia legislators have passed
   same-sex marriage bills in their states, of which four were vetoed by
   the governors, four were signed by state governors and the mayor of
   Washington D.C., and one was overridden by the state legislature:

California[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in California
     * In September 2003 the California state legislators passed a
       same-sex marriage bill which was vetoed by Governor Arnold
       Schwarzenegger. This was the first time a state legislature passed
       a same-sex marriage bill. In September 2007 the California state
       legislators again passed a same-sex marriage law, but it was once
       again vetoed by Governor Schwarzenegger. On October 12, 2009,
       Governor Schwarzenegger signed a bill, passed by the California
       state legislature, that recognized same-sex marriages performed
       outside of the state of California before November 5, 2008.
       Same-sex marriages performed after November 5, 2013 are recognized
       in California with all of the legal rights of marriage but without
       the use of the word marriage.
     * On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States in
       Hollingsworth v. Perry decided that the proponents of California
       Proposition 8 did not have legal standing to defend the provision
       of the California Constitution that stopped same-sex marriages in
       the state. Then, on June 28, 2013, a stay of effect, resulting from
       Proposition 8, was removed from the federal district court and
       thus, marriages by couples of the same-sex were allowed to be
       conducted again.

Vermont[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in Vermont
     * On March 25, 2009, Governor Jim Douglas vetoed the same sex
       marriage bill passed by the Vermont state legislators. On April 7,

       same-sex marriage in Maine. In another voter initiative held on
       November 6, 2012, same-sex marriage was approved and became legal
       on December 29, 2012.

       State agencies to begin to revise their policies and regulations to
       recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions.
       Governor Paterson's directive cited the Appellate Division decision
       in the Martinez case, as well as several lower court rulings. As a
       result of the governor's directive, New York became the first state
       that did not allow same-sex marriages, but whose state agencies
       recognized same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. On June 24,
       2011, Governor Cuomo signed the same-sex marriage bill passed by
       the New York state legislature. Same-sex marriage became legal in

   in
   Main article: Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey § Garden
   State Equality v. Dow

   that civil unions are unequal to marriage, and thus the state must
   recognize and perform same-sex marriages. The governor initially
   requested a stay from the Supreme Court of New Jersey, but the request
   was unanimously denied. On October 18, 2013, the same day that county
   clerks started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Christie
   withdrew his appeal, effectively permanently legalizing same-sex
   marriage in New Jersey.

Maryland[edit]

       domestic partnership passed by the City Council. It came into
       effect on June 11, 1992 but was delayed from being implemented in
       the District of Columbia until 2002, due to a Republican rider
       added to delay its implementation. Domestic partnerships in the
       District of Columbia have been expanded over the years, the largest
       expansion was on May 6, 2008 when the City Council passed a

   Recognition of same-sex unions in Hawaii
     * The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that the state had no
       compelling interest to deny same-sex couples a marriage license. In
       response, Hawaii state legislators submitted a constitutional
       amendment to the public to reserve marriage regulation solely to
       the discretion of the state legislature. The amendment passed and
       prohibited implementation of the Supreme Court's ruling. In March
       1996, Hawaii state legislators attempted and failed to pass a law
       to legalize domestic partnerships. In June 1997, Governor Ben
       Cayetano signed the Reciprocal Beneficiary Act into law, providing
       limited rights for a "legal relationship created when two
       consenting adults who are prohibited from marriage."^[45] In 2010,

       day Colorado voted 55.02% in favor and 44.98% against Amendment 43
       which banned same sex marriage in the constitution.
     * On November 7, 2006, Arizona voted 48.2% in favor and 51.8% against

       subdivision of the state, from providing employment benefits to
       same-sex partners of public employees and to same-sex partners of
       public employee retirees. Although the referendum passed a bill to
       place such a constitutional amendment on the ballot in November
       2008 stalled in the state legislature.
     * On November 4, 2008, Florida voted 61.92% in favor and 38.08%

       to opposite-sex couples.

Restrictions[edit]

Defense of Marriage Act[edit]

   Main article: Defense of Marriage Act
   See also: Respect for Marriage Act

   The events of the Hawaii Supreme Court prompted the United States
   Congress to enact the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, which
   forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions and
   relieved states of the requirement that they recognize same-sex unions
   performed in other jurisdictions.

   On June 26, 2013, Section 3 of DOMA was ruled unconstitutional by the
   U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor.

State constitutional amendments[edit]

   See also: U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions,
   List of U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions by
   type and Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States § Efforts
   to ban same-sex unions by constitutional amendment

   There was a backlash after Massachusetts legalized same sex marriage
   during the 2004 election cycle where fourteen states amended their
   constitution to ban recognition of same-sex marriages and often civil
   unions as well. Mississippi voters amended their constitution, 86% to
   14% – the largest margin in any state^[51]^[52] – to ban same-sex
   marriage and to prohibit the state from recognizing same-sex marriages
   that are legal elsewhere. Laws in Virginia, Michigan, Nebraska, North
   Carolina and Ohio, the most far-reaching, forbid recognition of any
   benefits similar to those of marriage between people of the same sex.

   Twenty-eight states have passed state constitutional amendments that
   ban same-sex marriage: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
   Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
   Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota,
   Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
   Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

   California Proposition 8 was found unconstitutional in 2010 by a United
   States District Court. The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit and
   later the Supreme Court, but since the government of California
   declined to defend the ballot measure, the Supreme Court ruled on June
   26, 2013 to dismiss both appeals.^[53]^[54]^[55] On June 28, 2013, the
   Ninth Circuit lifted its stay of the district court's ruling, enabling
   same-sex marriages to resume.^[56]

   Hawaii voters approved a constitutional amendment empowering the
   legislature to outlaw same-sex marriage; that state's lawmakers then
   did so in 1998.

   On November 6, 2012, Minnesota became the first state to vote down a
   proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The
   amendment failed with a 53% to 47% vote.^[57]

State statutes[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States §
   Efforts to prohibit same-sex unions

   After the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 many state
   legislators enacted state statutes, nicknamed mini-DOMA's, that ban
   same sex marriage.^[58] Twenty-seven states have state statutes that
   ban same-sex marriage: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
   Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
   Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South
   Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and
   Wyoming.

   Nebraska, Nevada, and Oregon all have constitutional amendments banning
   same sex marriage, but no state statutes banning same sex marriage.
   California's Statute has not been repealed but is no longer in effect
   as a result of both In Re Marriage Cases and Hollingsworth.

   Three states have state statutes that ban same-sex marriage, but do not
   have same-sex marriage banned in the constitution: Indiana, West
   Virginia, and Wyoming.

   California, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Delaware, Maine,
   Washington, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia used
   to have statutes banning same sex marriage, until they were overturned
   by courts or repealed by the state legislature. Proposition 22, the
   initiative which reinforce the 1977 statute ban on same-sex marriage in
   California, was declared unconstitutional by the California Supreme
   Court in 2008 but was subsequently reinstated by Proposition 8 until it
   was struck down in Hollingsworth.

   Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Rhode
   Island, and Vermont have never had any bans in neither their
   constitutions nor statute banning same-sex marriage.

Blood and tissue donation[edit]

   Main article: MSM blood donor controversy § United_States

   In the US, the current guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration is to permanently defer any male donor who has had sex
   with another man, in the period from 1977 to the present day.
   Furthermore, FDA regulations prevent the donation of tissues not
   considered lifesaving from men who have had sex with other men or have
   an unknown sexual history.^[59]

Anti-discrimination laws[edit]

Medical facilities[edit]

   On April 14, 2010, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order to
   the Department of Health and Human Services to draft new rules for all
   hospitals accepting Medicare or Medicaid funds. They would require
   facilities to grant visitation and medical decision-making rights to
   gay and lesbian partners, as well as designees of others such as widows
   and widowers.^[63] Such rights are not protected by law in many states.
   Obama said he was inspired by the case of a Florida family, where one
   of the mothers died while her partner and four children were denied
   visitation by the hospital.^[63]

Housing[edit]

   States that prohibit housing discrimination based on sexual orientation
   or gender identity. HUD regulations require all housing providers that
   receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual's sexual
   orientation or gender identity.
     Prohibits housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and
   gender identity
     Prohibits housing discrimination based on sexual orientation only
     Does not factor sexual orientation or gender identity/unclear
   Main article: Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity

   The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) is an agency
   within the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   FHEO is responsible for administering and enforcing federal fair
   housing laws and establishing policies that make sure all Americans
   have equal access to the housing of their choice. Housing
   discrimination refers to discrimination against potential or current
   tenants by landlords. In the United States, there is no federal law
   against such discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or
   gender identity, but at least twenty-one states and many major cities
   have enacted laws prohibiting it.^[64] See, for example, Washington
   House Bill 2661.

   In 2012, The United States Department of Housing and Urban
   Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a
   regulation to prohibit LGBT discrimination in federally-assisted
   housing programs. The new regulations ensure that the Department's core
   housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual
   orientation or gender identity. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal
   Opportunity is responsible for enforcing a variety of fair housing
   laws, which prohibit discrimination in both privately owned and
   publicly assisted housing including:
     * The Fair Housing Act
     * Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
     * Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
     * Section 109 of Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act
       of 1974
     * Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
     * Architectural Barriers Act of 1968
     * Age Discrimination Act of 1975
     * Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972

Employment[edit]

   Current U.S. LGBT employment discrimination laws.
   All employment:
     Sexual orientation and gender identity
     Sexual orientation only
   State employment:
     Sexual orientation and gender identity
     Sexual orientation only
     No state-level protection for LGBT employees
   Main article: LGBT employment discrimination in the United States

   There is no federal statute addressing employment discrimination based
   on sexual orientation or gender identity. Protections at the national
   level are limited. Some regulations protect government employees but do
   not extend their protections to the private sector. Twenty-one states,
   the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and over 140 cities and counties
   have enacted bans on discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or
   sexual identity. Employment discrimination refers to discriminatory
   employment practices such as bias in hiring, promotion, job assignment,
   termination, and compensation, and various types of harassment.^[65] In
   the United States there is "very little statutory, common law, and case
   law establishing employment discrimination based upon sexual
   orientation as a legal wrong."^[66]

   Presidents have established certain protections for some employees of
   the federal government by executive order. In 1995, President Bill
   Clinton's Executive Order 12968 establishing criteria for the issuance
   of security clearances included sexual orientation for the first time
   in its non-discrimination language: "The United States Government does
   not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national
   origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to
   classified information." It also said that "no inference" about
   suitability for access to classified information "may be raised solely
   on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee."^[67] Clinton's
   Executive Order 13087 in 1998 prohibited discrimination based on sexual
   orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian
   workforce. It applied to the large majority of federal employees, but
   not to the excepted services such as the military.^[68]

   At the start of 2010, the Obama administration included gender identity
   among the classes protected against discrimination under the authority
   of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On July 1, 2011,
   the EEOC ruled that job discrimination against lesbians, gays and
   bisexuals constituted a form of sex-stereotyping and thus violated
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.^[69] On April 20, 2012,^[69]
   the EEOC went further and ruled that gender identity was also a
   protected class under the ban on sex discrimination found in Title VII
   of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.^[70]

   On July 21, 2014, President Obama signed Executive Order 13672, adding
   "gender identity" to the categories protected against discrimination in
   hiring in the federal civilian workforce and both "sexual orientation"
   and gender identity" to the categories protected against discrimination
   in hiring and employment on the part of federal government contractors
   and sub-contractors.^[71]^[72]

Hate crime laws[edit]

   Main article: Hate crime laws in the United States

   Hate crime laws (also known as bias crimes laws) protect against crimes
   motivated by feelings of enmity against a protected class. Until 2009,
   a 1969 federal law defined hate crimes committed on the basis of a
   person's race, color, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a
   federally protected activity. In October 2009, Congress passed the
   Matthew Shepard Act, which expanded the definition of hate crimes to
   include gender, sexual orientation, gender-identity, and disability. It
   removed the requirement that the victim of a hate crime be engaged in a
   federally protected activity.^[73] President Obama signed the
   legislation on October 28, 2009.^[74]

   Two statutes, the Hate Crime Statistics Act (1990) and the Campus Hate
   Crimes Right to Know Act (1997), require the Department of Justice and
   the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as college/university
   campus security authorities, to collect and publish hate crime
   statistics.
   Current U.S. LGBT hate crimes laws by state. A national hate crimes law
   encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity.
     Sexual orientation and gender identity recognized in state hate
   crimes law
     Sexual orientation recognized in state hate crimes law
     Sexual orientation recognized for data collection about hate crimes
     State hate crimes law uninclusive of sexual orientation or gender
   identity

   Forty-five states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have
   statutes criminalizing various types of bias-motivated violence or
   intimidation (the exceptions are AR, GA, IN, SC, and WY). Each of these
   statutes covers bias on the basis of race, religion, and ethnicity; 32
   cover disability; 32 of them cover sexual orientation; 28 cover gender;
   13 cover age; 18 cover transgender/gender-identity; 5 cover political
   affiliation.^[75] 31 states and the District of Columbia have statutes
   creating a civil cause of action, in addition to the criminal penalty,
   for similar acts.^[75] 27 states and the District of Columbia have
   statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics; 16 of
   these cover sexual orientation.^[75]

   In Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993) the Supreme Court unanimously held that
   state penalty-enhancement laws for hate crimes were constitutional and
   did not violate First Amendment rights to freedom of thought and
   expression.

Conjugal visits[edit]

   material may be challenged and removed. (March 2014)

   In the United States, six states permit conjugal visits to prisoners:
   California, Connecticut, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York and
   Washington. All except Mississippi have legalized same-sex
   marriage.^[76] In June 2007, California, following the enactment in
   2005 of a state law requiring state agencies to provide the same rights
   to domestic partners as to married couples, became the first US state
   to allow same-sex conjugal visits. The new rules allowed for visits
   only by registered same-sex married couples or domestic partners,
   provided that the same-sex marriage or domestic partnership was
   established before the prisoner was incarcerated. In April 2011, New
   York adopted rules to allow conjugal visits for same-sex partners who
   are married or in civil unions.

Military service[edit]

   Main article: Sexual orientation and the United States military
   See also: Don't ask, don't tell and Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of
   2010

   Prior to 1993, lesbian and gay people were not permitted to serve in
   the US military. Under the "Don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) policy
   enacted that year, they were permitted to do so only if they did not
   disclose their sexual orientation. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act
   of 2010 permitted homosexual men and women to serve openly in the armed
   forces following once designated government officials certified that
   the military was prepared for the repeal.^[77] Since September 20,
   2011, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals have been able to serve
   openly.^[78] Transsexual and intersex service-members however are still
   banned from serving openly, due to Department of Defense medical
   policies which consider gender identity disorder to be a medically
   disqualifying condition.^[79]

Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity[edit]

   Main article: Sodomy laws in the United States
   See also: Crimes against nature and Age of consent in North America §
   United States

   Prior to the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, same-sex
   sexual activity was illegal in fourteen US states, Puerto Rico, and the
   US military.

   By that time, twenty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and five
   territories had repealed their state's sodomy laws by legislative
   action. After the repeal of "Don't Ask Don't Tell," the US Congress
   repealed sodomy laws in the US military. Twelve states have had state
   Supreme Court or state Appeals courts rule that their state's sodomy
   laws were unconstitutional. Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland,
   Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Virginia have all had their state sodomy
   laws struck down by the courts, but the legislatures have not repealed
   those laws.^[80] On April 18, 2013, the governor of Montana signed a
   bill repealing that state's sodomy law; it had previously been
   nullified by a state court decision.^[81]

   Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina,
   Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah have yet to repeal or strike
   down their state's sodomy laws, although these are unenforceable since
   the US Supreme Court ruling.

Reparations[edit]

   In 2003 Robert DeKoven, a professor at California Western School of Law
   in San Diego, was the first proponent to argue that gays and lesbians
   in the United States should be redressed for what they have suffered
   through years and decades of suppression and attacks.^[82] DeKoven
   cited the examples of the European Court of Human Rights as a model.
   New York University Professor Jacob Appel also argued that cause in
   2009 in the Free Press.^[83]

   When a state is striped with light gray and another color, the color
   stripe indicates the result of the last poll for that state, in the
   absence of data within the past two years.
   A state shown with two colors indicates recent polls with conflicting
   results.

   A March 2014 public opinion poll by Washington Post/ABC News showed
   support for same-sex marriage at 59% among Americans,^[84] and a
   February 2014 New York Times/CBS News opinion poll showed 56% support
   for same-sex marriage.^[85] A November 2012 Gallup poll indicated 61%
   support for gays and lesbians being allowed to adopt children.^[86]

   Older polls showed that the nation could be divided into roughly equal
   thirds: one third supports same-sex marriage completely, another
   supports only civil unions, and the last is against any form of union
   entirely.^[87]^[88] However, in terms of attitudes to homosexuality,
   the United States can hardly be called one country. It is common for
   polls to show a clear majority support for same-sex marriage in
   Northeastern states, and Pacific Coast states. States that have
   consistently shown a majority support for same-sex marriage for at
   least the past few years include Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut,
   Rhode Island, New York,^[89] New Jersey,^[90] New Hampshire, Hawaii,
   Oregon, and Washington. While some of these states do not have same-sex
   marriage, Iowa, which does have same-sex marriage, does not have
   majority support; in fact, polls place support in the high forties
   (slightly lower than the national average). In New York, where there
   was majority support reported since 2005, marriage became legal on July
   24, 2011. Iowa falls into a second category of states, where new
   generations of voters overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage (those
   under thirty have support placed above 60%).^[91]^[92]

Support[edit]

   Main article: List of supporters of same-sex marriage in the United
   States

   The main supporters of gay rights in the U.S. have generally been
   political liberals and libertarians. Regionally, support for the gay
   rights movement has been strongest in the areas of the North and West
   coasts, and in other states with large urban populations. Although the
   national Republican Party official platform opposes gay rights in the
   early 21st century, groups advocating for LGBT issues inside the party
   include the Log Cabin Republicans, GOProud, Young Conservatives For The
   Freedom To Marry, and College Republicans of the University of
   Pennsylvania and Columbia University. A poll in March 2014 found that
   40% of Republicans support same-sex marriage.^[93] In 2013, 52% of
   Republicans and GOP-leaning independents between the age of 18–49 years
   old supported same-sex marriage in a joint Washington Post-ABC News
   poll.^[94]

Opposition[edit]

   Main article: List of opponents of same-sex marriage in the United
   States

   The main opponents of gay rights in the U.S. have generally been
   political and religious conservatives. Conservatives cite various Bible
   passages from the Old and New Testaments as their justification for
   opposing gay rights. Regionally, opposition to the gay rights movement
   has been strongest in the South and in other states with a large rural
   and conservative population.

   As the movement for same-sex marriage has developed, many national
   and/or international organizations have opposed that movement. Those
   organizations include the American Family Association, the Christian
   Coalition, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, Save Our
   Children, NARTH, the national Republican Party,^[95] the Roman Catholic
   Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS
   Church),^[96] the Southern Baptist Convention,^[97] Alliance for
   Marriage, Alliance Defense Fund, Liberty Counsel, and the National
   Organization for Marriage. A number of these groups have been named as
   anti-gay hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.^[98]

U.S. political parties[edit]

US presidents[edit]

George Washington[edit]

   Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army

   To train the new American Army in the latest military drills and
   tactics, General George Washington brought in Friedrich Wilhelm von
   Steuben (1730–94), who had been an officer on the German General staff.
   Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution
   for homosexuality. He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in
   February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an
   American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors
   about sexual behavior at his parties, there never was an investigation
   of Steuben, and he received a Congressional pension after the
   war.^[99]^[100]

   The first evidence of antipathy to homosexuals serving in the United
   States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant Frederick
   Gotthold Enslin was brought to trial before a court-martial. According
   to General Washington's report: "...Lieutt. Enslin of Colo. Malcolm's
   Regiment tried for attempting to commit sodomy ..." Washington's
   secretary described the results of the trial: "His Excellency the
   Commander in Chief approves the sentence and with Abhorrence &
   Detestation of such Infamous Crimes orders Lieut. Enslin to be drummed
   out of Camp tomorrow morning...."^[101]

John Adams[edit]

   Presidency

   In 1801, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801
   that continued all criminal laws of Maryland and Virginia in the now
   formally structured District, with those of Maryland applying to that
   portion of the District ceded from Maryland, and those of Virginia
   applying to that portion ceded from Virginia. At the time, Maryland had
   a sodomy law applicable only to free males with a punishment of "labour
   for any time, in their discretion, not exceeding seven years for the
   same crime, on the public roads of the said county, or in making,
   repairing or cleaning the streets or bason [sic] of Baltimore-town;" it
   imposed the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. Similarly,
   Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for free persons committing
   sodomy, but imposed the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. The
   law went into effect on February 27, 1801.^[102]

Thomas Jefferson[edit]

   Governorship of Virginia

   In 1779, Thomas Jefferson wrote a law in Virginia which contained a
   punishment of castration for men who engage in sodomy.^[103] However,
   what was intended by Jefferson as a liberalization of the sodomy laws
   in Virginia at that time was rejected by the Virginia Legislature,
   which continued to prescribe death as the maximum penalty for the crime
   of sodomy in that state.^[104]

Andrew Jackson[edit]

   Presidency

   In 1831, Congress established penalties in the District of Columbia for
   a number of crimes, but not for sodomy. It specified that "every other
   felony, misdemeanor, or offence not provided for by this act, may and
   shall be punished as heretofore[.]" At the time, Maryland and Virginia
   had a penalty of 1–10 years for committing sodomy. It went into effect
   in March 2, 1831.^[102]

Benjamin Harrison[edit]

   Presidency

   In 1892, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that states
   that "for the preservation of the public peace and the protection of
   property within the District of Columbia." Labeled in the law as
   vagrants were "all public prostitutes, and all such persons who lead a
   notoriously lewd or lascivious course of life[.]" All offenders had to
   post bond of up to $200 for good behavior for a period of six months.
   The law went into effect on July 29, 1892.^[102]

William McKinley[edit]

   Presidency

   In 1898, Congress deleted the word "notoriously" from the provision
   concerning a lewd or lascivious course of life, thereby allowing
   prosecution of persons without the condition of notoriety. The bond for
   good behavior was raised to $500, and the law was made gender-neutral.
   The law went into effect on July 8, 1898.^[102]

   In 1901, Congress adopted a new code for the District of Columbia that
   expressly recognized common-law crimes, with a penalty for them of up
   to five years and/or a $1,000 fine. The law went into effect on March
   3, 1901.^[102]

Woodrow Wilson[edit]

   Presidency

   On December 14, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson vetoed the Immigration
   Act of 1917, excluded individuals from entering the United States who
   were found "mentally defective" or who had a "constitutional
   psychopathic inferiority." A similar Public Health Service definition
   of homosexuals was used simultaneously by the Immigration and
   Naturalization Service (INS) to reinforce the language of the
   Immigration Act of 1917 and effectively ban all homosexual immigrants
   who disclosed their sexual minority status. On February 5, 1917, the
   Congress overrode Wilson's veto, implementing the Immigration Act of
   1917 into law.^[105]

   On March 1, 1917, the Articles of War of 1916 are implemented. This
   included a revision of the Articles of War of 1806, the new regulations
   detail statutes governing U.S. military discipline and justice. Under
   the category Miscellaneous Crimes and Offences, Article 93 states that
   any person subject to military law who commits "assault with intent to
   commit sodomy" shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.^[106]

   On June 4, 1920, Congress modified Article 93 of the Articles of War of
   1916. It was changed to make the act of sodomy itself a crime, separate
   from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy.^[106] It went
   into effect on February 4, 1921.^[107]

Franklin Roosevelt[edit]

   Assistant Secretary of the Navy

   In 1919, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt requests
   an investigation into "vice and depravity" in the sea services, which
   launches a sting operation in which undercover operatives attempt to
   seduce sailors suspected of being homosexual. At least 17 sailors are
   jailed and court-martialed before public outcry prompts the Senate to
   condemn the operation.^[106]

   Presidency

   In 1935, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that made
   it a crime for "any person to invite, entice, persuade, or to address
   for the purpose of inviting, enticing, or persuading any person or
   persons...to accompany, to go with, to follow him or her to his or her
   residence, or to any other house or building, inclosure, or other
   place, for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd
   purpose." It imposed a fine of up to $100, up to 90 days in jail, and
   courts were permitted to "impose conditions" on anyone convicted under
   this law, including "medical and mental examination, diagnosis and
   treatment by proper public health and welfare authorities, and such
   other terms and conditions as the court may deem best for the
   protection of the community and the punishment, control, and
   rehabilitation of the defendant." The law went into effect on August
   14, 1935.^[102]

   In 1941, Congress enacted a new solicitation law for the District of
   Columbia that labeled a "vagrant" any person who "engages in or commits
   acts of fornication or perversion for hire." The law went into effect
   on December 17, 1941.^[102]

Harry Truman[edit]

   Presidency

   In 1948, Congress enacted the first sodomy law in the District of
   Columbia, which established a penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a
   fine of up to $1,000 for sodomy. Also included with this sodomy law was
   a psychopathic offender law and a law "to provide for the treatment of
   sexual psychopaths in the District of Columbia, and for other
   purposes." The law went into effect on June 9, 1948.^[102]

   On May 5, 1950, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was passed by
   Congress and was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, and
   became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all
   military personnel, defining it as "any person subject to this chapter
   who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the
   same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy.
   Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the
   offence."^[106]

   On June 25, 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was
   vetoed by President Truman because he regarded the bill as
   "un-American" and discriminatory. The bill prohibits "aliens afflicted
   with a psychopathic personality, epilepsy, or a mental defect" from
   entry into the United States.^[108]^[109]^[110] Congress would later
   override his veto and implemented the act into law.^[105]

Dwight Eisenhower[edit]

   Presidency

   On April 27, 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower signs Executive Order
   10450 which prohibits Federal employees from being members of a group
   or organization considered subversive. The order lists "sexual
   perversion" as a security risk constituting grounds for termination or
   denial of employment. The order went into effect on May 27, 1953.^[106]

   Without explicitly referring to homosexuality, the executive order
   responded to several years of charges that the presence of homosexual
   employees in the State Department posed blackmail risks. Attorney
   General Herbert Brownell, Jr. explained that the new order was designed
   to encompass both loyalty and security risks and he differentiated
   between the two: "Employees could be a security risk and still not be
   disloyal or have any traitorous thoughts, but it may be that their
   personal habits are such that they might be subject to blackmail by
   people who seek to destroy the safety of our country."^[111]

   The press recognized the revolutionary nature of the new executive
   order. The Washington Post said that it established not a loyalty test
   but a "suitability test." Some in government referred to their new
   "integrity-security" program. Some of those the press expected to be
   excluded from federal employment included "a person who drinks too
   much," "an incorrigible gossip," "homosexuals," and "neurotics."^[111]

   In 1953, Congress changed the solicitation law in the District of
   Columbia so that the jail term of up to 90 days was retained, but the
   maximum fine was raised to $250, and the reference to the power of
   judges to "impose conditions" on the defendant was removed. The law
   went into effect on June 29, 1953.^[102]

Lyndon B. Johnson[edit]

   Senator of Texas

   On February 2, 1950, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson voted for Uniform Code
   of Military Justice.^[112]

   Presidency

   On October 19, 1964, Walter Jenkins, a longtime top aide to President
   Johnson, had been arrested by District of Columbia Police in a YMCA
   restroom. He and another man were booked on a disorderly conduct
   charge.^[113]

   In October 1964, Johnson released a statement of sympathy for Jenkins
   who "has worked with me faithfully for 25 years, with dedication,
   devotion and tireless labor" He also fed conspiracy theories that
   Jenkins had been framed. He claimed that before his arrest Jenkins had
   attended a cocktail party where the waiters came from the Republican
   National Committee, though the party was hosted by Newsweek to
   celebrate the opening of its new offices.^[114] Johnson told Fortas
   that Jenkins needed to resign. On October 14, 1964, Jenkins resigned.
   Johnson immediately ordered a poll to determine the public's reaction
   to the affair and learned the next day that its effect on the voters
   was negligible.^[115]

   Johnson's Republican opponent in the 1964 presidential election, Barry
   Goldwater, knew Jenkins from the Senate and from serving as commanding
   officer of his Air Force Reserve unit, but initially denied knowing
   him.^[116] He did not comment on the incident while campaigning, though
   it fit well with the charges he had been making of a lack of morality
   in Johnson's administration, though he was referring to Bobby Baker and
   Billie Sol Estes.^[117] Instead, since FBI agents had just questioned
   him about Jenkins, he publicly asked Hoover to explain why Jenkins had
   not undergone a rigorous security check before joining the White House
   staff.^[118]

   Goldwater's campaign offices distributed bumper stickers and buttons
   bearing slogans such as, "LBJ - LIGHT BULB JENKINS: NO WONDER HE TURNED
   THE LIGHTS OUT" and "ALL THE WAY WITH LBJ, BUT DON'T GO NEAR THE YMCA".
   During the remainder of the campaign Goldwater occasionally alluded to
   the scandal. In speeches he referred to Johnson's "curious crew who
   would run the country" to the knowing amusement of his audience.^[119]
   At the time, observers noted the difference between the way Goldwater
   alluded to the scandal and the way the Republican National Committee
   and Goldwater's running mate, William E. Miller, used it to exploit
   "popular fears."^[120] Goldwater later said he chose not to make the
   incident a campaign issue. "It was a sad time for Jenkins' wife and
   children, and I was not about to add to their private sorrow," he wrote
   in his autobiography. "Winning isn't everything. Some things, like
   loyalty to friends or lasting principle, are more important."

   Campaigning in San Diego on October 28, 1964, Johnson told reporters
   that "President Eisenhower had the same type of problem with his
   appointments secretary. The only difference is, we Democrats felt sorry
   for him and thought it was a case of sickness and disease, and we
   didn't try to capitalize on a man's misfortune. We never mentioned
   it."^[121]^[122]^[123]

   After the election, the American Mental Health Foundation wrote a
   letter to President Johnson protesting the "hysteria" surrounding the
   case:^[124]

          The private life and inclinations of a citizen, Government
          employee or not, does not necessarily have any bearing on his
          capacities, usefulness, and sense of responsibility in his
          occupation. The fact that an individual is homosexual, as has
          been strongly implied in the case of Mr. Jenkins, does not per
          se make him more unstable and more a security risk than any
          heterosexual person.

   On October 3, 1965, Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act
   of 1965, which added "sexual deviation" as a medical ground for denying
   prospective immigrants entry into the United States. The bill went into
   effect on June 30, 1968.^[105]

   In 1966, Johnson still insisted vehemently in private that the Jenkins
   arrest resulted from a GOP frame-up and "someday we will prove
   it."^[121]

Richard Nixon[edit]

   Presidency

   In August 1970, Richard Nixon, on the issue of same-sex marriage, said
   "I can't go that far; that's the year 2000! Negroes [and whites], okay.
   But that's too far!"^[125]

   On May 13, 1971, in a conversation among President Richard Nixon, John
   D. Ehrlichman, and H. R. Haldeman:

     "Archie's Guys." Archie is sitting here with his hippie son-in-law,
     married to the screwball daughter. The son-in-law apparently goes
     both ways. This guy. He's obviously queer--wears an ascot--but not
     offensively so. Very clever. Uses nice language. Shows pictures of
     his parents. And so Arch goes down to the bar. Sees his best friend,
     who used to play professional football. Virile, strong, this and
     that. Then the fairy comes into the bar. I don't mind the
     homosexuality. I understand it. Nevertheless, goddamn, I don't think
     you glorify it on public television, homosexuality, even more than
     you glorify whores. We all know we have weaknesses. But, goddammit,
     what do you think that does to kids? You know what happened to the
     Greeks! Homosexuality destroyed them. Sure, Aristotle was a homo. We
     all know that. So was Socrates.

   —Richard Nixon, ^[126]

     You know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors
     were fags. Neither in a public way. You know what happened to the
     popes? They were layin' the nuns; that's been goin' on for years,
     centuries. But the Catholic Church went to hell three or four
     centuries ago. It was homosexual, and it had to be cleaned out.
     That's what's happened to Britain. It happened earlier to France.
     Let's look at the strong societies. The Russians. Goddamn, they root
     'em out. They don't let 'em around at all. I don't know what they do
     with them. Look at this country. You think the Russians allow dope?
     Homosexuality, dope, immorality, are the enemies of strong
     societies. That's why the Communists and left-wingers are clinging
     to one another. They're trying to destroy us. I know Moynihan will
     disagree with this, [Attorney General John] Mitchell will, and
     Garment will. But, goddamn, we have to stand up to this.

   —Richard Nixon, ^[126]

     But it's not just the ratty part of town. The upper class in San
     Francisco is that way. The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time
     to time--it is the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever
     imagine, with that San Francisco crowd. I can't shake hands with
     anybody from San Francisco. Decorators. They got to do something.
     But we don't have to glorify it. You know one of the reasons
     fashions have made women look so terrible is because the goddamned
     designers hate women. Designers taking it out on the women. Now
     they're trying to get some more sexy things coming on again.

   —Richard Nixon, ^[126]

   In 1972, San Francisco's Gay Activists Alliance disbanded and formed
   the Gay Voter's League, a group that campaigned for the reelection of
   President Richard Nixon.^[127] In October 1972, representative of the
   Committee to Re-elect the President addressed gay voters on behalf of
   Richard M. Nixon's campaign in San Francisco. The event was organized
   by the Gay Voters League of San Francisco.^[128]

Gerald Ford[edit]

   House Minority Leader and Representative of Michigan's 5th
          congressional district

   On August 25, 1965, Rep. Gerald Ford voted for the Immigration and
   Nationality Act of 1965.^[129]

   Presidency

   On March 5, 1976, when asked about the issue of gay rights, with
   respect to hiring, employment, and housing, Gerald Ford said "I
   recognize that this is a very new and serious problem in our society. I
   have always tried to be an understanding person as far as people are
   concerned who are different than myself. That doesn't mean that I agree
   with or would concur in what is done by them or their position in
   society. I think this is a problem we have to face up to, and I can't
   give you a pat answer tonight. I just would be dishonest to say that
   there is a pat answer under these very difficult circumstances"^[130]

   In 1976, during that year's presidential campaign, President Gerald
   Ford was "zapped" by activists in Ann Arbor, Michigan over federal
   immigration rules. The protests forced President Ford to admit that he
   was not aware that homosexuality was used as a basis for exclusion in
   immigration rulings.^[127]

   Post presidency

   Gerald Ford, as former president, formally opposed the Briggs
   Initiative in 1977, which sought to ban homosexuals from teaching in
   public school. In October 2001, he broke with conservative members of
   the Republican party by stating that gay and lesbian couples "ought to
   be treated equally. Period." He became the highest ranking Republican
   to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that
   there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job
   discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would
   reach out to gay and lesbian voters.^[131] He also was a member of the
   Republican Unity Coalition, which The New York Times described as "a
   group of prominent Republicans, including former President Gerald R.
   Ford, dedicated to making sexual orientation a non-issue in the
   Republican Party".^[132]

Jimmy Carter[edit]

   Post governorship of Georgia

   In February 1976, Carter said he opposed discrimination on the basis of
   sexual orientation, but in June 1976 he withdrew his support of a gay
   rights plank in the Democratic Party platform.^[133]

   Presidency

   In 1977, under the guidance of Jimmy Carter, a policy was removed which
   barred employment of gays from employment in the foreign service and
   Internal Revenue Service ended its policy that forced LGBT education
   and charity groups to publicly state that homosexuality is a "sickness,
   disturbance, or diseased pathology." That same year, fourteen gay and
   lesbian activists were invited to the White House for the first
   official visit ever. Jimmy Carter publicly opposed the Briggs
   Initiative. However, in March 1980, Carter issued a formal statement
   indicating he would not issue an executive order banning anti-gay
   discrimination in the US federal government and that he would not
   support including a gay rights plank in the Democratic Party
   platform.^[133]^[134]

   Post presidency

   In 2004, Carter came out for civil unions and stated that he "opposes
   all forms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and
   believes there should be equal protection under the law for people who
   differ in sexual orientation".^[135] In 2007, he called for ending the
   ban on gays in the military.^[136] In March 2012, Jimmy Carter came out
   in favor of same sex marriage.^[137]

Ronald Reagan[edit]

   Main article: Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration §
   LGBT_Rights

   Post governorship of California

   The first chapter of what would become the national Log Cabin
   Republicans (LCR) formed in 1978 to fight California's Briggs
   Initiative, a ballot initiative that would have banned homosexuals from
   teaching in public schools. The chapter worked diligently and
   successfully convinced Governor Reagan to publicly oppose the
   measure.^[127] Reagan penned an op-ed against the Briggs Initiative in
   which he wrote, "Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a contagious
   disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an
   individual's sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a
   child's teachers do not really influence this."^[138]

   Presidency

   On the 1980 campaign trail, he spoke of the gay civil rights movement:

     My criticism is that [the gay movement] isn’t just asking for civil
     rights; it’s asking for recognition and acceptance of an alternative
     lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone, nor can
     I.^[139]

   No civil rights legislation for LGBT individuals passed during Reagan's
   tenure. Additionally, Reagan has been criticized by some LGBT groups
   for allegedly ignoring (by failing to adequately address or fund) the
   growing AIDS epidemic, even as it took thousands of lives in the 1980s.
   Reagan's Surgeon General from 1982-1989, Dr. C. Everett Koop, claims
   that his attempts to address the issue were shut out by the Reagan
   Administration. According to Koop, the prevailing view of the Reagan
   Administration was that "transmission of AIDS was understood to be
   primarily in the homosexual population and in those who abused
   intravenous drugs" and therefore that people dying from AIDS were "only
   getting what they justly deserve."^[140]

   In 1981, during Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party, White House
   interior decorator, Ted Graber, spent a night in the Reagans' private
   White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case.^[138]

George H. W. Bush[edit]

   Vice presidency

   In 1988, the Republican Party's nominee, Vice President George H. W.
   Bush, endorsed a plan to protect persons with AIDS from
   discrimination.^[127]

   Presidency

   As President, George H. W. Bush signed legislation that extended gay
   rights. On April 23, 1990, George H. W. Bush signed the Hate Crime
   Statistics Act, which requires the Attorney General to collect data on
   crimes committed because of the victim's race, religion, disability,
   sexual orientation, or ethnicity. It was the first federal statute to
   "recognize and name gay, lesbian and bisexual people."^[141] On July
   26, 1990, George H. W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act
   of 1990. On November 29, 1990, Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990,
   which withdrew the phrase "sexual deviation" from the Immigration and
   Nationality Act (INA) so that it could no longer be used as a basis for
   barring entry of immigration to the U.S. for homosexuals.^[127]

   In a television interview, Bush said if he found out his grandchild was
   gay, he would "love his child", but tell him homosexuality wasn't
   normal and discourage him from working for gay rights. In February
   1992, the chairman of the Bush-Quayle campaign met with the National
   Gay and Lesbian Task Force.^[133] In May 1992, he appointed Anne-Imelda
   Radice to serve as the Acting Chairman of the National Endowment for
   the Arts.^[142] Losing ground in the 1992 Republican president primary
   to President Bush's far-right challenger, Pat Buchanan, the Bush
   campaign turned to the right, and President Bush publicly denounced
   same-sex marriage.^[143] The 1992 Log Cabin Republican convention was
   held in Spring, Texas, a Houston exurb. The main issue discussed was
   whether or not LCR would endorse the re-election of President George H.
   W. Bush. The group voted to deny that endorsement because Bush did not
   denounce anti-gay rhetoric at the 1992 Republican National
   Convention.^[144] Many in the gay community believed President Bush
   hadn't had done enough on the issue of AIDS. Urvashi Vaid argues that
   Bush's anti-gay rhetoric "motivated conservative gay Democrats and
   loyal gay Republicans, who had helped defeat Dukakis in 1988, to throw
   their support behind Clinton."^[133]

   In 1992, the City Council passed the "The Health Benefits Expansion
   Act", which was signed into law by the Mayor of Washington, D.C. The
   bill, which established domestic partnerships in the District of
   Columbia, became law on June 11, 1992. Every year from 1992 to 2000,
   the Republican leadership of the U.S. Congress added a rider to the
   District of Columbia appropriations bill that prohibited the use of
   federal or local funds to implement the Health Care Benefits Expansion
   Act.^[145] On October 5, 1992, Bush signed the H.R. 6056 into law,
   which included the Republican rider to the appropriations bill.^[146]

   Post presidency

   In 2013, former President George H. W. Bush served as a witness at a
   same-sex wedding of Bonnie Clement and Helen Thorgalsen, who own a
   general store together in Maine.^[147]

Bill Clinton[edit]

   Governorship of Arkansas

   In 1992, Governor Bill Clinton, as a candidate for President, issued a
   public statement of support for repeal of Arkansas's sodomy law.^[148]
   Also in 1992, the Human Rights Campaign, American's largest LGBT rights
   organization, issued its first presidential endorsement in 1992 to Bill
   Clinton.^[149]

   Presidency

   Bill Clinton's legacy on gay rights is a matter of controversy. LGBT
   rights activist Richard Socarides credits Clinton as the first
   President to publicly champion gay rights,^[149] but Clinton's signing
   of DOMA and DADT have led critics like Andrew Sullivan to argue Clinton
   was a detriment to rather than an ally for the LGBT rights
   movement.^[150]

   In December 1993, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive
   known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which allowed gay men and women to
   serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a
   secret, and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's
   sexual orientation.^[151] The policy was developed as a compromise
   after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military
   met with staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans
   and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn
   (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise
   led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that "the
   President should lift the ban ... even though [his executive order] was
   sure to be overriden by the Congress".^[152] Some gay-rights advocates
   criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making
   his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.^[153] Their
   position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by
   executive order, noting that President Harry Truman used executive
   order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders
   argue that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write
   the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to
   integrate the military in the future.^[154] Later in his presidency, in
   1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he
   did not think any serious person could say it was not "out of
   whack".^[155]

   On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage
   Act (DOMA), which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal
   union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to
   recognize gay marriages performed in other states.^[156] Paul Yandura,
   speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that
   Clinton's signing of DOMA "was a political decision that they made at
   the time of a re-election." In defense of his actions, Clinton has said
   that DOMA was an attempt to "head off an attempt to send a
   constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a
   possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a "very
   reactionary Congress."^[157] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides
   said, "... the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it
   was time to move on and get the president re-elected."^[158] Others
   were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist
   Evan Wolfson has called these claims "historic revisionism".^[158] In a
   July 2, 2011 editorial The New York Times opined, "The Defense of
   Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue,
   signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy
   moments."^[159]

   Despite DOMA, Clinton, who was the first President to select openly gay
   persons for Administration positions,^[160] is generally credited as
   the first President to publicly champion gay rights.^[149] During his
   Presidency, Clinton controversially issued two substantial executive
   orders on behalf of gay rights, the first was in 1995 that lifted the
   ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees^[161] and the
   second was in 1998 that outlawed discrimination based on sexual
   orientation in the federal civilian workforce.^[162] Under President
   Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention
   and treatment more than doubled.^[163] And Clinton also pushed for
   passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment
   Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass
   the Senate by a single vote in 1996.^[164] Advocacy for these issues,
   paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement
   at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's reelection in
   1996 by the Human Rights Campaign.^[149]

   Clinton was the first President to select openly gay persons for
   Administration positions, appointing over 150 LGBT appointees.^[165]
   The first openly gay US ambassador, James Hormel, received a recess
   appointment from the President after the Senate failed to confirm the
   nomination.

   On June 2, 2000, Clinton declared June to be Gay and Lesbian Pride
   Month, the first president to do so.^[166]

   Post presidency

   In 2008, Clinton publicly opposed the passage of California's
   Proposition 8 and recorded robocalls urging Californians to vote
   against it.^[167] In July 2009, he came out in favor of same-sex
   marriage.^[168] On March 7, 2013, Clinton called for the overturn of
   the Defense of Marriage Act by the US Supreme Court.^[169]

George W. Bush[edit]

   In 1994, Bush pledged to veto any effort to repeal Texas's sodomy law,
   calling it “a symbolic gesture of traditional values.”^[170]

   Governorship of Texas

   In 1997, Governor Bush signed into law a bill adding "A license may not
   be issued for the marriage of persons of the same sex" into the Texas
   Family Code.^[171]

   In a 1998 Texas Gubernatorial election political awareness test, he
   answered no to the questions of whether Texas government should include
   sexual orientation in Texas' anti-discrimination laws and whether he
   supports Texas recognizing same-sex marriage.^[172]

   In 1999, the Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, which would have increased
   punishment for criminals motivated by hatred of a victim’s gender,
   religion, ethnic background or sexual orientation, was killed in
   committee by Texas Senate Republicans. Governor Bush was criticized for
   letting the hate crimes bill die in a Texas Senate committee. Bush
   spokesman Sullivan said the governor never took a position on the bill.
   According to Louvon Harris, sister of James Byrd, said that Bush’s
   opposition to the bill reportedly revolved around the fact that it
   would cover gays and lesbians. The governor’s office “contacted the
   family and asked if we would consider taking sexual orientation out of
   the bill, and our answer was no, because the bill is for everybody.
   Everybody should be protected by the law.” said Harris. In a 2000
   presidential debate, Al Gore would attack Bush for allowing the bill to
   die in committee, with Bush responding Texas already had a hate crimes
   statute, and nothing more was needed.^[170] George W. Bush also stated
   his opposition New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that said the Boy Scouts
   of America must accept gays in their organization. “I believe the Boy
   Scouts is a private organization and they should be able to set the
   standards that they choose to set,” Bush said.^[173] Bush would also
   express his support bans gay foster parenting and adoption.^[174]

   During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of gay
   rights legislation. In a 2000 Republican presidential debate, George W.
   Bush, said he opposes same-sex marriage, but supports state's rights
   when it came to the issue of same-sex marriage. During the campaign he
   had refused to comment on Vermont’s civil unions law.^[173] On April
   13, 2000, Governor Bush became first presumptive GOP presidential
   nominee ever to meet publicly with gay Republicans in Austin,
   Texas.^[175] On August 4, 2000, Bush received the endorsement of the
   Log Cabin Republicans, the GOP's largest gay group, for
   president.^[176] He also received the endorsement of the newly formed
   Republican Unity Coalition.^[176]^[177] In a 2000 presidential debate
   with Al Gore, Bush stated he supported the Defense of Marriage Act and
   the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy. However, he stated that he opposed
   sodomy laws, a reversal of his position as governor of
   Texas.^[173]^[178]^[179]

   Presidency

   George W. Bush was either neutral towards or opposed gay rights as
   president. In his eight years of office, Bush's views on gay rights
   were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush
   White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating
   evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal
   President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination on the basis
   of sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but Bush's
   critics felt as if he failed to enforce the executive order.^[180] He
   retained Clinton’s Office of National AIDS Policy and was the first
   Republican president to appoint an openly gay man to serve in his
   administration, Scott Evertz as director of the Office of National AIDS
   Policy.^[181] Bush also became the second President, after President
   Clinton, to select openly gay appointees to his administration. Bush's
   nominee as ambassador to Romania, Michael E. Guest, became the second
   openly gay man U.S. Ambassador and the first to be confirmed by the
   Senate. He did not repeal any of the spousal benefits that Clinton had
   introduced for same-sex federal employees. He did not attempt to repeal
   Don't ask, don't tell, nor make an effort to change it.^[173]

   In April 2002, White House officials held an unannounced briefing in
   April for the Log Cabin Republicans. On June 27, 2002, President Bush
   has signed a bill allowing death benefits to be paid to domestic
   partners of firefighters and police officers who die in the line of
   duty, permanently extending a federal death benefit to same-sex couples
   for the first time.^[182]

   In 2003, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas
   that sodomy laws against consenting adults was unconstitutional.
   President Bush's press secretary Ari Fleischer refused to comment on
   the decision, noting only that the administration had not filed a brief
   in the case.^[183] In 2004, Bush said “What they do in the privacy of
   their house, consenting adults should be able to do,”^[184]

   Previously Bush said he state's rights when it came to marriage,
   however, after Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, on February
   24, 2004, Bush announced his support for an amendment to the US
   Constitution banning same-sex marriage.^[185] Due to his support of the
   Federal Marriage Amendment, the Log Cabin Republicans declined to
   endorse the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004.^[144] Bush's defense
   of the FMA led the group to vote 22 to 2 against an endorsement of his
   reelection.^[186] The Palm Beach County chapter in Florida did endorse
   him, resulting in the revocation of their charter.^[187] On September
   22, 2004, the Abe Lincoln Black Republican Caucus (ALBRC), a group of
   young urban Black gay Republicans, voted in a special call meeting in
   Dallas, Texas, to endorse President Bush for re-election.^[188] In an
   October president debate, Bush said he didn't know whether
   homosexuality is a choice or not.^[173]

   In 2007, Bush threatened to veto the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes
   Prevention Act of 2007, which would have included sexual orientation in
   hate crimes, and Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 2007.

   In December 2008, the Bush administration refused to support the U.N.
   declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity at the United
   Nations that condemns the use of violence, harassment, discrimination,
   exclusion, stigmatization, and prejudice based on sexual orientation
   and gender identity.^[189]

   Post presidency

   In his post presidency interviews, he refused to take a position on the
   issue of same-sex marriage.^[190]^[191]

Barack Obama[edit]

   Illinois state senator

   Obama supported legalizing same-sex marriage when he first ran for the
   Illinois State Senate in 1996.^[192] When he ran for re-election to the
   Illinois Senate in 1998, was undecided about legalizing same-sex
   marriage and supported including sexual orientation to the states
   non-discrimination laws.^[193]^[194] During his time as a state senator
   he cosponsored of a bill amending the Illinois Human Rights Act to
   include protections for LGBT people which prohibits discrimination on
   the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace,
   housing, and all public places and supported Illinois gender violence
   act.

   US Senator from Illinois

   Obama supported civil unions, but opposed same-sex marriage when he ran
   for the U.S. Senate in 2004 and for U.S. President in 2008.^[192] He
   supports civil unions that would carry equal legal standing to that of
   marriage for same-sex couples, but believes that decisions about the
   title of marriage should be left to the states.^[195]^[196]

   During his time as senator, Obama co-sponsored the Employment
   Non-Discrimination Act, Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate
   Crimes Prevention Act, Tax Equity for Domestic Partner and Health Plan
   Beneficiaries Act, and Early Treatment for HIV Act.^[197]^[198]

   In the 109th United States Congress, Obama received a score of 89% by
   the Human Rights Campaign.^[198]

   In 2006, Obama voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which
   would have defined marriage as between one man and one woman in the US
   Constitution.^[199]

   In 2007, Senator Obama said he opposed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act
   and the Don't ask, don't tell policy when it passed and supported
   repealing it. He also said that homosexuality is not a choice, support
   adoption rights for same-sex couples, and would work as president to
   extend the 1,000 federal rights granted to marriage couples to couples
   in civil unions. He also voted for Kennedy Amendment to the National
   Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 that would expand
   federal jurisdiction to reach serious, violent hate crimes perpetrated
   because of the victim’s sexual orientation and gender identity and the
   Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against
   HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act.^[194]^[197]

   In the 2008 presidential election, he expressed his opposition to state
   constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in California, and Florida on
   the November ballot,^[200]^[201]^[202] but stated in a 2008 interview
   that he personally believes that marriage is "between a man and a
   woman" and that he is "not in favor of gay marriage."^[203] In the
   110th United States Congress, Obama received a score of 94% by the
   Human Rights Campaign.^[198] In the 2008 election, Obama received the
   endorsement of the following gay rights organizations: Houston GLBT
   Political Caucus,^[204] Human Rights Campaign,^[205] and the National
   Stonewall Democrats.^[206]^[207]

   Presidency

   President Barack Obama has taken a definitive pro-LGBT rights stance.
   In 2009, his administration reversed Bush administration policy and
   signed the U.N. declaration that calls for the decriminalization of
   homosexuality.^[208] In June 2009, Obama became the first president to
   declare the month of June to be LGBT pride month; President Clinton had
   declared June Gay and Lesbian Pride Month.^[166]^[209] Obama did so
   again in June 2010,^[210] June 2011,^[211] June 2012,^[212] June
   2013,^[213] and June 2014.^[214]

   On October 28, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd,
   Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which added gender, sexual orientation,
   gender identity, and disability to the federal hate crimes law.^[215]

   In October 2009, he nominated Sharon Lubinski to become the first
   openly gay U.S. marshal to serve the Minnesota district.^[216] On
   January 4, 2010, he appointed Amanda Simpson the Senior Technical
   Advisor to the Department of Commerce, making her the first openly
   transgender person appointed to a government post by a U.S.
   President.^[217]^[218]^[219] He has appointed the most U.S. gay and
   lesbian officials of any U.S. president.^[220]

   At the start of 2010, the Obama administration included gender identity
   among the classes protected against discrimination under the authority
   of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On April 15,
   2010, Obama issued an executive order to the Department of Health and
   Human Services that required medical facilities to grant visitation and
   medical decision-making rights to same-sex couples.^[221] In June 2010,
   he expanded the Family Medical Leave Act to cover employees taking
   unpaid leave to care for the children of same-sex partners.^[222] On
   December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of
   2010 into law.^[223]

   On February 23, 2011, President Obama instructed the Justice Department
   to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act in court.^[224]

   In March 2011, the U.S. issued a nonbinding declaration in favor of gay
   rights that gained the support of more than 80 countries at the
   U.N.^[225] In June 2011, the U.N. endorsed the rights of gay, lesbian,
   and transgender people for the first time, by passing a resolution that
   was backed by the U.S., among other countries.^[225]

   In March and April 2012, Obama expressed his opposition to state
   constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in North Carolina, and
   Minnestoa.^[226]

   On May 9, 2012, Obama publicly supported same-sex marriage, the first
   sitting U.S. President to do so. Obama told an interviewer that:^[227]

     over the course of several years as I have talked to friends and
     family and neighbors when I think about members of my own staff who
     are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex
     relationships, who are raising kids together, when I think about
     those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there
     fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that Don't
     Ask Don't Tell is gone, because they are not able to commit
     themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I’ve just concluded
     that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm
     that I think same sex couples should be able to get married.

   In the 2012 election, Obama received the endorsement of the following
   gay rights organizations: Equal Rights Washington, Fair Wisconsin,
   Gay-Straight Alliance,^[228]^[229] Human Rights Campaign,^[230] and the
   National Stonewall Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
   gave Obama a score of 100% on the issue of gays and lesbians in the US
   military and a score of 75% on the issue of freedom to marry for gay
   people.^[231]

   Obama also called for full equality during his second inaugural address
   on January 21, 2013: "Our journey is not complete until our gay
   brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if
   we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one
   another must be equal as well." It was the first mention of rights for
   gays and lesbians or use of the word gay in an inaugural
   address.^[232]^[233]

   On March 1, 2013, Obama, speaking about Hollingsworth v. Perry, the
   U.S. Supreme Court case about Proposition 8, said "When the Supreme
   Court asks do you think that the California law, which doesn't provide
   any rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples other than
   just the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples—if the Supreme
   Court asks me or my attorney general or solicitor general, 'Do we think
   that meets constitutional muster?' I felt it was important for us to
   answer that question honestly. And the answer is no." The
   administration took the position that the Supreme Court should apply
   "heightened scrutiny" to California's ban—a standard under which legal
   experts say no state ban could survive.^[234]

   On August 8, 2013, Obama criticized Russia's anti-gay law.^[235]

   On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed the National Defense
   Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 into law, which repealed the ban
   on consensual sodomy in the UCMJ.^[236] On February 16, 2014, Obama
   criticized Uganda's anti-gay law.^[237]

   Obama included openly gay athletes in the February 2014 Olympic
   delegation, namely Brian Boitano and Billie Jean King (who was replaced
   by Caitlin Cahow, who was also openly gay.) ^[238]^[239] This was done
   in criticism of Russia's anti-gay law.^[239]

   Obama was criticized for failing to sign an executive order banning
   discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity
   on the part of federal contractors.^[240] On July 21, 2014, President
   Obama signed Executive Order 13672, adding "gender identity" to the
   categories protected against discrimination in hiring in the federal
   civilian workforce and both "sexual orientation" and gender identity"
   to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring and
   employment on the part of federal government contractors and
   sub-contractors.^[71]

   Obama was also criticized for meeting with the anti-gay Ugandan
   president Yoweri Museveni at a dinner with African heads of state in
   August 2014.^[241]

   Later in August Obama made a surprise video appearance at the opening
   ceremony of the 2014 Gay Games.^[242]^[243]

Democratic Party[edit]

   The Democratic Party's 2012 national platform opposes the Defense of
   Marriage Act and supports "equal responsibility, benefits, and
   protections" for same-sex couples,^[244] and explicitly supports
   same-sex marriage.^[245]

National Stonewall Democrats[edit]

   Main article: National Stonewall Democrats

Republican Party[edit]

   same sex couples, supports a ban on same-sex marriage through a federal
   constitutional amendment, along with state constitutional amendments
   banning same-sex marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act.^[246]

Log Cabin Republicans[edit]

   Main article: Log Cabin Republicans

   Created in 1977 in California, in response to the anti-gay Briggs
   Initiative, which attempted to ban homosexuals from teaching in public
   schools. Log Cabin Republicans support full equal rights for LGBT
   people, including Employment Nondiscrimination Act and same-sex
   marriage.

GOProud[edit]

   Main article: GOProud

   GOProud is a gay conservative organization founded in 2009. GOProud
   supports repealing DOMA, supports same-sex marriage, and believes
   marriage should be left to the states. GOProud also has no official

   Libertarian Party

   The Libertarian Party has endorsed libertarian perspectives on LGBT
   rights and has promoted marriage equality since it was created in 1971.
   The Libertarian Party also wishes to lift the bans, but with the
   ultimate goal of marriage privatization.^[247]

Outright Libertarians[edit]

Constitution Party[edit]

   Main article: Constitution Party (United States)

   The Constitution Party (United States) is strongly opposed to all forms

   very conservative and has ties to Christian Reconstructionism, a
   political movement within Conservative Christian Churches.

Lavender Greens[edit]

   Main article: Lavender Greens

Other political parties[edit]

   While many American socialist and communist political parties initially
   preferred to ignore the issue, most now support gay rights causes. The
   Socialist Party USA was the first party to nominate an openly gay man,
   David McReynolds, as its Presidential candidate in 1980. Socialist
   groups generally integrate a stronger approach to gender identity
   issues than mainstream parties.
