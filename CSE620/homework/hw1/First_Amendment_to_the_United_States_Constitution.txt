   The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution
   prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of
   religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom
   of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the
   right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a
   governmental redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15,
   1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.

   The Bill of Rights was originally proposed as a measure to assuage
   Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially,
   the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress, and
   many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are
   today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court
   applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as
   incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
   Amendment.

   In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the Court drew on Founding
   Father Thomas Jefferson's correspondence to call for "a wall of
   separation between church and State", though the precise boundary of
   this separation remains in dispute. Speech rights were expanded
   significantly in a series of 20th and 21st-century court decisions
   which protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech,
   campaign financing, pornography, and school speech; these rulings also
   defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections. The
   Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the
   burden of proof for defamation and libel suits, most notably in New
   York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Commercial speech, however, is less
   protected by the First Amendment than political speech, and is
   therefore subject to greater regulation.

   The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions,
   and applies to a wide variety of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and
   New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that
   the First Amendment protected against prior restraint—pre-publication
   censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right
   to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In
   addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court
   has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of
   association.

   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives

     Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
     or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
     of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
     assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
     grievances.^[1]

Background

   Main article: Anti-Federalism

   In 1776, the second year of the American Revolutionary War, the
   Virginia colonial legislature passed a Declaration of Rights that
   included the sentence "The freedom of the press is one of the greatest
   bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic
   Governments." Eight of the other thirteen states made similar pledges.
   However, these declarations were generally considered "mere admonitions
   to state legislatures", rather than enforceable provisions.^[2]
   James Madison, drafter of the Bill of Rights

   After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles
   of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed
   a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring among other changes
   a stronger chief executive. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention
   delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed
   that the Constitution include a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing
   civil liberties. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights
   drafter James Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees
   of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate
   individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights
   were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated
   by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.^[3]

   For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen
   states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to
   ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's
   lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the
   Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification
   (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed
   that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for
   the addition of a bill of rights. The U.S. Constitution was eventually
   ratified by all thirteen states. In the 1st United States Congress,
   following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed
   twenty constitutional amendments, which were then condensed to twelve
   and forwarded to the states. Ten of these were ratified and became the
   Bill of Rights.^[4] The First Amendment passed the House and Senate
   with almost no recorded debate, complicating future discussion of the
   Amendment's intent.^[5]^[6] The First Amendment (along with the rest of
   the Bill of Rights) was submitted to the states for ratification on
   September 25, 1789, and adopted on December 15, 1791.^[7]^[8]

Establishment of religion

   Main article: Establishment Clause

   Thomas Jefferson wrote with respect to the First Amendment and its
   restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government in an
   1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists (a religious minority concerned
   about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in
   Connecticut):

     Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely
     between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his
     faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach
     actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence
     that act of the whole American people which declared that their
     legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of
     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a
     wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this
     expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights
     of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of
     those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural
     rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his
     social duties.^[9]

   In Reynolds v. United States (1878) the Supreme Court used these words
   to declare that "it may be accepted almost as an authoritative
   declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured.
   Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere [religious]
   opinion, but was left free to reach [only those religious] actions
   which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.”
   Quoting from Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom the
   court stated further in Reynolds:

     In the preamble of this act [...] religious freedom is defined; and
     after a recital 'that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his
     powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or
     propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a
     dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty,' it
     is declared 'that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of
     civil government for its officers to interfere [only] when
     [religious] principles break out into overt acts against peace and
     good order.' In these two sentences is found the true distinction
     between what properly belongs to the church and what to the State.

   Originally, the First Amendment applied only to the federal government,
   and some states continued official state religions after ratification.
   Massachusetts, for example, was officially Congregationalist until the
   1830s.^[10] In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the U.S. Supreme
   Court incorporated the Establishment Clause (i.e., made it apply
   against the states). In the majority decision, Justice Hugo Black
   wrote:

     The "establishment of religion" clause of the First Amendment means
     at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up
     a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all
     religions, or prefer one religion to another ... in the words of
     Jefferson, the [First Amendment] clause against establishment of
     religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between
     church and State' ... That wall must be kept high and impregnable.
     We could not approve the slightest breach.^[11]

   In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), the Supreme Court ruled that the
   Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring
   any kind of religious test for public office. In the Board of Education
   of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet (1994),^[12] Justice
   David Souter, writing for the majority, concluded that "government
   should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to
   irreligion."^[13] In a series of cases in the first decade of the
   2000s—Van Orden v. Perry (2005), McCreary County v. ACLU (2005), and
   Salazar v. Buono (2010)—the Court considered the issue of religious
   monuments on federal lands without reaching a majority reasoning on the
   subject.^[14]

Separationists

   U.S. President Thomas Jefferson wrote in his correspondence of "a wall
   of separation between church and State".

   Everson used the metaphor of a wall of separation between church and
   state, derived from the correspondence of President Thomas Jefferson.
   It had been long established in the decisions of the Supreme Court,
   beginning with Reynolds v. United States in 1879, when the Court
   reviewed the history of the early Republic in deciding the extent of
   the liberties of Mormons. Chief Justice Morrison Waite, who consulted
   the historian George Bancroft, also discussed at some length the
   Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments by James
   Madison, who drafted the First Amendment; Madison used the metaphor of
   a "great barrier."^[15]

   Justice Hugo Black adopted Jefferson's words in the voice of the
   Court.^[16] The Court has affirmed it often, with majority, but not
   unanimous, support. Warren Nord, in Does God Make a Difference?,
   characterized the general tendency of the dissents as a weaker reading
   of the First Amendment; the dissents tend to be "less concerned about
   the dangers of establishment and less concerned to protect free
   exercise rights, particularly of religious minorities."^[17]

   Beginning with Everson, which permitted New Jersey school boards to pay
   for transportation to parochial schools, the Court has used various
   tests to determine when the wall of separation has been breached.
   Everson laid down the test that establishment existed when aid was
   given to religion, but that the transportation was justifiable because
   the benefit to the children was more important. In the school prayer
   cases of the early 1960s, (Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District
   v. Schempp), aid seemed irrelevant; the Court ruled on the basis that a
   legitimate action both served a secular purpose and did not primarily
   assist religion. In Walz v. Tax Commission (1970), the Court ruled that
   a legitimate action could not entangle government with religion; in
   Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), these points were combined, declaring that an
   action was not establishment if:^[18]
    1. the statute (or practice) has a secular purpose;
    2. its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits
       religion; and
    3. it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with
       religion.

   This Lemon test has been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but
   it remains the predominant means by which the Court enforces the
   Establishment Clause.^[19] In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the
   entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a
   factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or
   practice.^[20] In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the
   Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a
   concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as
   part of the primary purpose test.^[19] With the endorsement test and
   coercion test further tests were developed to determine the
   constitutionality under the Establishment Clause of certain government
   actions.^[21]^[22]

   In Lemon the Court stated that that the separation of church and state
   could never be absolute: "Our prior holdings do not call for total
   separation between church and state; total separation is not possible
   in an absolute sense. Some relationship between government and
   religious organizations is inevitable," the court wrote. "Judicial
   caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of
   separation, far from being a "wall," is a blurred, indistinct, and
   variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular
   relationship."^[23]

Accommodationists

   Accommodationists, in contrast, argue along with Justice William O.
   Douglas that "[w]e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose
   a Supreme Being".^[24] This group holds that the Lemon test should be
   applied selectively.^[24] As such, for many conservatives, the
   Establishment Clause solely prevents the establishment of a state
   church, not public acknowledgements of God nor "developing policies
   that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular
   sect and are consistent with the secular government's goals."^[25]^[26]

Free exercise of religion

   Main article: Free Exercise Clause

   "Freedom of religion means freedom to hold an opinion or belief, but
   not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good
   order," Chief Justice Waite wrote in Reynolds v. United States (1878).
   The U.S. Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious
   belief and opinions, laws can be made to regulate some religious
   practices, e.g., human sacrifices, and the Hindu practice of suttee.
   The Court stated that to rule otherwise, "would be to make the
   professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the
   land, and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.
   Government would exist only in name under such circumstances."^[27] In
   Cantwell v. State of Connecticut the Court held that the free exercise
   of religion is one of the “liberties” protected by the due process
   clause of the 14th Amendment and thus applied it to the states. The
   freedom to believe is absolute, but the freedom to act is not
   absolute.^[28]

   In Sherbert v. Verner (1963),^[29] the Supreme Court required states to
   meet the "strict scrutiny" standard when refusing to accommodate
   religiously motivated conduct. This meant that a government needed to
   have a "compelling interest" regarding such a refusal. The case
   involved Adele Sherbert, who was denied unemployment benefits by South
   Carolina because she refused to work on Saturdays, something forbidden
   by her Seventh-day Adventist faith.^[30] In Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972),
   the Court ruled that a law that "unduly burdens the practice of
   religion" without a compelling interest, even though it might be
   "neutral on its face," would be unconstitutional.^[31]^[32]

   The need for a compelling interest was narrowed in Employment Division
   v. Smith (1990),^[33] which held no such interest was required under
   the Free Exercise Clause regarding a law that does not target a
   particular religious practice.^[34] In Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v.
   City of Hialeah (1993),^[35] the Supreme Court ruled Hialeah had passed
   an ordinance banning ritual slaughter, a practice central to the
   Santería religion, while providing exceptions for some practices such
   as the kosher slaughter. Since the ordinance was not "generally
   applicable," the Court ruled that it needed to have a compelling
   interest, which it failed to have, and so was declared
   unconstitutional.^[36]

   In 1993, the Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act
   (RFRA), seeking to restore the compelling interest requirement applied
   in Sherbert and Yoder. In City of Boerne v. Flores (1997),^[37] the
   Court struck down the provisions of RFRA that forced state and local
   governments to provide protections exceeding those required by the
   First Amendment, on the grounds that while the Congress could enforce
   the Supreme Court's interpretation of a constitutional right, the
   Congress could not impose its own interpretation on states and
   localities.^[38] According to the court's ruling in Gonzales v. UDV
   (2006),^[39] RFRA remains applicable to federal laws and so those laws
   must still have a "compelling interest".^[40]

Speech critical of the government

   The Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of any
   federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the 20th century.
   For example, the Supreme Court never ruled on the Alien and Sedition
   Acts of 1798, legislation by President John Adams' Federalist Party to
   ban seditious libel; three of the Supreme Court's justices presided
   over resulting sedition trials without indicating any
   reservations.^[41] The leading critics of the law, Vice President
   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, argued for the Acts'
   unconstitutionality based on the First Amendment and other
   Constitutional provisions.^[42] Jefferson succeeded Adams as president,
   in part due to the unpopularity of the latter's sedition prosecutions;
   he and his party quickly overturned the Acts and pardoned those
   imprisoned by them.^[43] In the majority opinion in New York Times Co.
   v. Sullivan (1964),^[44] Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. noted the
   importance of this public debate as a precedent in First Amendment law
   and ruled that the Acts had been unconstitutional: "Although the
   Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its
   validity has carried the day in the court of history."^[45]^[46]

World War I

   During the patriotic fervor of World War I and the First Red Scare, the
   Espionage Act of 1917 imposed a maximum sentence of twenty years for
   anyone who caused or attempted to cause "insubordination, disloyalty,
   mutiny, or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the
   United States." Specifically, the Espionage Act of 1917 states that if
   anyone allows any enemies to enter or fly over the United States and
   obtain information from a place connected with the national defense,
   they will be punished.^[47] Hundreds of prosecutions followed.^[48] In
   1919, the Supreme Court heard four appeals resulting from these cases:
   Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, Frohwerk v. United
   States, and Abrams v. United States.^[49]
   Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes formulated the clear and present danger
   test for free speech cases.

   In the first of these cases, Socialist Party of America official
   Charles Schenck had been convicted under the Espionage Act for
   publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft.^[50] Schenck
   appealed, arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech
   Clause of the First Amendment. In Schenck v. United States, the Supreme
   Court unanimously rejected Schenck's appeal and affirmed his
   conviction.^[51] This conviction continued to be debated over whether
   Schenck went against the right to freedom of speech protected by the
   First Amendment.^[52] Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., writing for
   the Court, explained that "the question in every case is whether the
   words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as
   to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the
   substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent."^[53] One week
   later, in Frohwerk v. United States, the court again upheld an
   Espionage Act conviction, this time that of a journalist who had
   criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars.^[54] Both of these cases
   show that the government can overrule The Bill of Rights with certain
   acts like The Espionage Act of 1917. It all depends on what was done to
   put the United States in danger.

   In Debs v. United States, the Court elaborated on the "clear and
   present danger" test established in Schenck.^[55] On June 16, 1918,
   Eugene V. Debs, a political activist, delivered a speech in Canton,
   Ohio, in which he spoke of "most loyal comrades were paying the penalty
   to the working class – these being Wagenknecht, Baker and Ruthenberg,
   who had been convicted of aiding and abetting another in failing to
   register for the draft."^[56] Following his speech, Debs was charged
   and convicted under the Espionage Act. In upholding his conviction, the
   Court reasoned that although he had not spoken any words that posed a
   "clear and present danger", taken in context, the speech had a "natural
   tendency and a probable effect to obstruct the recruiting
   services".^[57]^[58] In Abrams v. United States, four Russian refugees
   appealed their conviction for throwing leaflets from a building in New
   York; the leaflets argued against President Woodrow Wilson's
   intervention in Russia against the October Revolution. The majority
   upheld their conviction, but Holmes and Justice Louis Brandeis
   dissented, holding that the government had demonstrated no "clear and
   present danger" in the four's political advocacy.^[54]

Extending protections

   Justice Louis Brandeis wrote several dissents in the 1920s upholding
   free speech claims.

   The Supreme Court denied a number of Free Speech Clause claims
   throughout the 1920s, including the appeal of a labor organizer,
   Benjamin Gitlow, who had been convicted after distributing a manifesto
   calling for a "revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".^[59] In
   Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Court upheld the conviction, but a
   majority also found that the First Amendment applied to state laws as
   well as federal laws, via the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
   Amendment.^[60]^[61] Holmes and Brandeis dissented in several more
   cases in this decade, however, advancing the argument that the Free
   Speech Clause protected a far greater range of political speech than
   the Court had previously acknowledged. In Whitney v. California
   (1927),^[62] in which Communist Party USA organizer Charlotte Anita
   Whitney had been arrested for "criminal syndicalism", Brandeis wrote a
   dissent in which he argued for broader protections for political
   speech:

     Those who won our independence ... believed that freedom to think as
     you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the
     discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech
     and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion
     affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of
     noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert
     people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this
     should be a fundamental principle of the American government.^[63]

   In Herndon v. Lowry (1937), the Court heard the case of African
   American Communist Party organizer Angelo Herndon, who had been
   convicted under the Slave Insurrection Statute for advocating black
   rule in the southern United States. In a 5–4 decision, the Court
   reversed Herndon's conviction, upholding Holmes' "clear and present
   danger" test for the first time and arguing that the state of Georgia
   had not demonstrated that Herndon's actions met this standard.^[64]

   In 1940, Congress enacted the Smith Act, making it illegal to advocate
   "the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the
   United States by force and violence."^[65] The statute provided law
   enforcement a tool to combat Communist leaders. After Eugene Dennis was
   convicted in the Foley Square trial for attempting to organize a
   Communist Party, he petitioned for certiorari, which the Supreme Court
   granted.^[66] In Dennis v. United States (1951),^[67] the Court upheld
   the law, 6–2.^[a]^[68] Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson relied on Holmes'
   "clear and present danger" test as adapted by Learned Hand: "In each
   case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the 'evil,' discounted by
   its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary
   to avoid the danger."^[69] Clearly, Vinson suggested, clear and present
   danger did not intimate "that before the Government may act, it must
   wait until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid
   and the signal is awaited."^[70] In a concurring opinion, Justice Felix
   Frankfurter proposed a "balancing test", which soon supplanted the
   "clear and present danger" test:

     The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the
     interest in national security are better served by candid and
     informed weighing of the competing interests, within the confines of
     the judicial process.^[68]

   In Yates v. United States (1957), the Supreme Court limited the Smith
   Act prosecutions to "advocacy of action" rather than "advocacy in the
   realm of ideas". Advocacy of abstract doctrine remained protected while
   speech explicitly inciting the forcible overthrow of the government was
   punishable under the Smith Act.^[71]^[72]

   During the Vietnam War, the Court's position on public criticism of the
   government changed drastically. Though the Court upheld a law
   prohibiting the forgery, mutilation, or destruction of draft cards in
   United States v. O'Brien (1968),^[73] fearing that burning draft cards
   would interfere with the "smooth and efficient functioning" of the
   draft system,^[74]^[75] the next year, the court handed down its
   decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969),^[76] expressly overruling
   Whitney v. California.^[77] Now the Supreme Court referred to the right
   to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms:

     [Our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional
     guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to
     forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation
     except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing
     imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or cause such
     action.^[78]

   Brandenburg discarded the "clear and present danger" test introduced in
   Schenck and further eroded Dennis.^[79]^[80] In Cohen v. California
   (1971),^[81] the Court voted 5–4 to reverse the conviction of a man
   wearing a jacket reading "Fuck the Draft" in the corridors of a Los
   Angeles County courthouse. Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote in the
   majority opinion that Cohen's jacket fell in the category of protected
   political speech despite the use of an expletive: "one man's vulgarity
   is another man's lyric."^[82]

Political speech

Anonymous speech

   In Talley v. California (1960),^[83] the Court struck down a Los
   Angeles city ordinance that made it a crime to distribute anonymous
   pamphlets. Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority opinion: "There can
   be no doubt that such an identification requirement would tend to
   restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of
   expression ... Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books
   have played an important role in the progress of mankind."^[84] In
   McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission (1995),^[85] the Court struck
   down an Ohio statute that made it a crime to distribute anonymous
   campaign literature.^[86] However, in Meese v. Keene (1987),^[87] the
   Court upheld the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, under which
   several Canadian films were defined as "political propaganda",
   requiring their sponsors to be identified.^[88]

Campaign finance

   Main article: Campaign finance reform in the United States
   U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, plaintiff in McConnell v. Federal
   Election Commission

   In Buckley v. Valeo (1976),^[89] the Supreme Court reviewed the Federal
   Election Campaign Act of 1971 and related laws, which restricted the
   monetary contributions that may be made to political campaigns and
   expenditure by candidates. The Court affirmed the constitutionality of
   limits on campaign contributions, stating that they "serve[d] the basic
   governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral
   process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual
   citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and
   discussion."^[90] However, the Court overturned the spending limits,
   which it found imposed "substantial restraints on the quantity of
   political speech."^[91]^[92]

   The court again scrutinized campaign finance regulation in McConnell v.
   Federal Election Commission (2003).^[93] The case centered on the
   Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), a federal law that
   imposed new restrictions on campaign financing. The Supreme Court
   upheld provisions which barred the raising of soft money by national
   parties and the use of soft money by private organizations to fund
   certain advertisements related to elections. However, the Court struck
   down the "choice of expenditure" rule, which required that parties
   could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or
   permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, which the Court
   agreed "placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make
   unlimited independent expenditures."^[94] The Court also ruled that the
   provision preventing minors from making political contributions was
   unconstitutional, relying on Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community
   School District.

   In Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.
   (2007),^[95] the Court sustained an "as applied" challenge to BCRA,
   holding that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a
   primary or general election. In Davis v. Federal Election Commission
   (2008),^[96] the Supreme Court declared the "Millionaire's Amendment"
   provisions of the BCRA to be unconstitutional. The Court held that
   easing BCRA restrictions for an opponent of a self-financing candidate
   spending at least $350,000 of his or her own money violated the freedom
   of speech of the self-financing candidate.^[97]

   In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010),^[98] the
   Court ruled that the BCRA's federal restrictions on electoral advocacy
   by corporations or unions were unconstitutional for violating the Free
   Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The Court overruled Austin v.
   Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990),^[99] which had upheld a state law
   that prohibited corporations from using treasury funds to support or
   oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First or Fourteenth
   Amendments. The Court also overruled the portion of McConnell that
   upheld such restrictions under the BCRA.^[100] In other words, the
   ruling was considered to hold that "political spending is a form of
   protected speech under the First Amendment".^[101]

   In McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (2014),^[102] the Court
   ruled that federal aggregate limits on how much a person can donate to
   candidates, political parties, and political action committees,
   combined respectively in a two-year period known as an “election
   cycle,” violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.^[103]

Flag desecration

   The divisive issue of flag desecration as a form of protest first came
   before the Supreme Court in Street v. New York (1969).^[104] In
   response to hearing an erroneous report of the murder of civil rights
   activist James Meredith, Sidney Street burned a 48-star U.S. flag.
   Street was arrested and charged with a New York state law making it a
   crime "publicly [to] mutilate, deface, defile, or defy, trample upon,
   or cast contempt upon either by words or act [any flag of the United
   States]."^[105] In a 5–4 decision, the Court, relying on Stromberg v.
   California (1931),^[106] found that because the provision of the New
   York law criminalizing "words" against the flag was unconstitutional,
   and the trial did not sufficiently demonstrate that he was convicted
   solely under the provisions not yet deemed unconstitutional, the
   conviction was unconstitutional. The Court, however, "resist[ed] the
   pulls to decide the constitutional issues involved in this case on a
   broader basis" and left the constitutionality of flag-burning
   unaddressed.^[107]^[108]

   The ambiguity with regard to flag-burning statutes was eliminated in
   Texas v. Johnson (1989).^[109] In that case, Gregory Lee Johnson burned
   an American flag at a demonstration during the 1984 Republican National
   Convention in Dallas, Texas. Charged with violating a Texas law
   prohibiting the vandalizing of venerated objects, Johnson was
   convicted, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000. The
   Supreme Court reversed his conviction in a 5–4 vote. Justice William J.
   Brennan, Jr. wrote in the decision that "if there is a bedrock
   principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that government may not
   prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the
   idea offensive or disagreeable."^[110] Congress then passed a federal
   law barring flag burning, but the Supreme Court struck it down as well
   in United States v. Eichman (1990).^[111]^[112] A Flag Desecration
   Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been proposed repeatedly in
   Congress since 1989, and in 2006 failed to pass the Senate by a single
   vote.^[113]

Falsifying military awards

   While the unauthorized wear or sale of the Medal of Honor has been a
   punishable offense under federal law since the early 20th
   century,^[114]^[115] the Stolen Valor Act made criminal the act of not
   only wearing, but also verbally claiming entitlement to military awards
   that a person did not in fact earn.^[116] In United States v. Alvarez
   (2012), the Supreme Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act, ruling that
   the law violated the right to free speech for the government to punish
   people for making false claims regarding military service or
   honors.^[117] The decision was a 6–3 ruling, but the six justices in
   the majority could not agree on a single rationale for it.^[118]

Commercial speech

   Commercial speech is speech done on behalf of a company or individual
   for the purpose of making a profit. Unlike political speech, the
   Supreme Court does not afford commercial speech full protection under
   the First Amendment. To effectively distinguish commercial speech from
   other types of speech for purposes of litigation, the Court uses a list
   of four indicia:^[119]
    1. The contents do "no more than propose a commercial transaction."
    2. The contents may be characterized as advertisements.
    3. The contents reference a specific product.
    4. The disseminator is economically motivated to distribute the
       speech.

   Alone, each indicium does not compel the conclusion that an instance of
   speech is commercial; however, "[t]he combination of all these
   characteristics...provides strong support for...the conclusion that the
   [speech is] properly characterized as commercial speech."^[120]

   In Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942),^[121] the Court upheld a New York
   City ordinance forbidding the "distribution in the streets of
   commercial and business advertising matter."^[122] Writing for a
   unanimous court, Justice Owen Roberts explained:

     This court has unequivocally held that streets are proper places for
     the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and
     disseminating opinion and that, though the states and municipalities
     may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest,
     they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in their
     public thoroughfares. We are equally clear that the Constitution
     imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely
     commercial advertising.^[123]

   In Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council
   (1976),^[124] the Court overruled Valentine and ruled that commercial
   speech was entitled to First Amendment protection:

     What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the
     dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely
     lawful activity, fearful of that information's effect upon its
     disseminators and its recipients... [W]e conclude that the answer to
     this one is in the negative.^[125]

   In Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association (1978),^[126] the Court ruled
   that commercial speech was not protected by the First Amendment as much
   as other types of speech:

     We have not discarded the "common-sense" distinction between speech
     proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area
     traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties
     of speech. To require a parity of constitutional protection for
     commercial and noncommercial speech alike could invite a dilution,
     simply by a leveling process, of the force of the [First]
     Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind of
     speech.^[127]

   In Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission
   (1980),^[128] the Court clarified what analysis was required before the
   government could justify regulating commercial speech:
    1. Is the expression protected by the First Amendment? Lawful?
       Misleading? Fraud?
    2. Is the asserted government interest substantial?
    3. Does the regulation directly advance the governmental interest
       asserted?
    4. Is the regulation more extensive than is necessary to serve that
       interest?

   Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court, applying the Central Hudson
   standards in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of
   Puerto Rico (1986),^[129] affirmed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's
   conclusion that Puerto Rico's Games of Chance Act of 1948, including
   the regulations thereunder, was not facially unconstitutional. The lax
   interpretation of Central Hudson adopted by Posadas was soon restricted
   under 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996),^[130] when the Court
   invalidated a Rhode Island law prohibiting the publication of liquor
   prices.

School speech

   In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District
   (1969),^[131] the Supreme Court extended free speech rights to students
   in school. The case involved several students who were punished for
   wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The Court ruled that
   the school could not restrict symbolic speech that did not "materially
   and substantially" interrupt school activities.^[132] Justice Abe
   Fortas wrote:

     First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special
     characteristics of the school environment, are available to teachers
     and students. It can hardly be argued that either students or
     teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or
     expression at the schoolhouse gate. [...] [S]chools may not be
     enclaves of totalitarianism. School officials do not possess
     absolute authority over their students. Students ... are possessed
     of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they
     themselves must respect their obligations to the State.^[133]

   In Healy v. James (1972), the Court ruled that Central Connecticut
   State College's refusal to recognize a campus chapter of Students for a
   Democratic Society was unconstitutional, reaffirming Tinker.^[134]

   However, since 1969 the Court has also placed several limitations on
   Tinker interpretations. In Bethel School District v. Fraser
   (1986),^[135] the Court ruled that a student could be punished for his
   sexual-innuendo-laced speech before a school assembly and, in Hazelwood
   v. Kuhlmeier (1988),^[136] the Court found that school newspapers
   enjoyed fewer First Amendment protections and are subject to school
   censorship.^[137] In Morse v. Frederick (2007),^[138] the Court ruled
   that schools could, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict
   student speech at school-sponsored events, even events away from school
   grounds, if students promote "illegal drug use."^[139]

Obscenity

   Main article: United States obscenity law
   Justice Potter Stewart wrote that while he could not precisely define
   pornography, "I know it when I see it."

   The federal government and the states have long been permitted to limit
   obscenity or pornography. While the Supreme Court has generally refused
   to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment, pornography
   is subject to little regulation. However, the definitions of obscenity
   and pornography have changed over time.^[10]

   In Rosen v. United States (1896), the Supreme Court adopted the same
   obscenity standard as had been articulated in a famous British case,
   Regina v. Hicklin (1868).^[140] The Hicklin test defined material as
   obscene if it tended "to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open
   to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this
   sort may fall."^[141] In the early twentieth century, literary works
   including An American Tragedy (Theodore Dreiser, 1925) and Lady
   Chatterley's Lover (D.H. Lawrence, 1928) were banned for obscenity. In
   the federal district court case United States v. One Book Called
   Ulysses (1933), Judge John M. Woolsey established a new standard to
   evaluate James Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922), stating that works must be
   considered in their entirety, rather than declared obscene on the basis
   of an individual part of the work.^[142]

   The Supreme Court ruled in Roth v. United States (1957)^[143] that the
   First Amendment did not protect obscenity.^[142] It also ruled that the
   Hicklin test was inappropriate; instead, the Roth test for obscenity
   was "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community
   standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole,
   appeals to the prurient interest."^[144] This definition proved hard to
   apply, however, and in the following decade, members of the Court often
   reviewed films individually in a court building screening room to
   determine if they should be considered obscene.^[145] Justice Potter
   Stewart, in Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964),^[146] famously stated that,
   although he could not precisely define pornography, "I know it when I
   see it".^[147]

   The Roth test was expanded when the Court decided Miller v. California
   (1973).^[148] Under the Miller test, a work is obscene if:

     (a)...‘the average person, applying contemporary community
     standards’ would find the work, as a whole, appeals to the prurient
     interest,...(b)...the work depicts or describes, in a patently
     offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable
     state law, and (c)...the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious
     literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.^[149]

   Note that "community" standards—not national standards—are applied
   whether the material appeals to the prurient interest, leaving the
   question of obscenity to local authorities.^[142] Child pornography is
   not subject to the Miller test, as the Supreme Court decided in New
   York v. Ferber (1982) and Osborne v. Ohio (1990),^[150]^[151] ruling
   that the government's interest in protecting children from abuse was
   paramount.^[152]^[153]

   Personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be
   prohibited by law. In Stanley v. Georgia (1969),^[154] the Court ruled
   that "[i]f the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State
   has no business telling a man, sitting in his own house, what books he
   may read or what films he may watch."^[155] However, it is
   constitutionally permissible for the government to prevent the mailing
   or sale of obscene items, though they may be viewed only in private.
   Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002)^[156] further upheld these
   rights by invalidating the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996,
   holding that, because the act "[p]rohibit[ed] child pornography that
   does not depict an actual child" it was overly broad and
   unconstitutional under the First Amendment^[157] and that:

     First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government
     seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that
     impermissible end. The right to think is the beginning of freedom,
     and speech must be protected from the government because speech is
     the beginning of thought.^[158]

   In United States v. Williams (2008),^[159] the Court upheld the PROTECT
   Act of 2003, ruling that prohibiting offers to provide and requests to
   obtain child pornography did not violate the First Amendment, even if a
   person charged under the Act did not possess child
   pornography.^[160]^[161]

Memoirs of convicted criminals

   In some states, there are Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted
   criminals from publishing memoirs for profit.^[162] These laws were a
   response to offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the
   murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type
   in New York as a violation of the First Amendment in the case Simon &
   Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991).^[163] That statute did not
   prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it
   provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a
   time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New
   York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical
   and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states
   remain unchallenged.^[164]

Defamation

   Main article: United States defamation law
   Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote the landmark decision New York
   Times Co. v. Sullivan, requiring the demonstration of "actual malice"
   in libel suits against public figures.

   American tort liability for defamatory speech or publications traces
   its origins to English common law. For the first two hundred years of
   American jurisprudence, the basic substance of defamation law continued
   to resemble that existing in England at the time of the Revolution. An
   1898 American legal textbook on defamation provides definitions of
   libel and slander nearly identical to those given by Blackstone and
   Coke. An action of slander required the following:^[165]
    1. Actionable words, such as those imputing the injured party: is
       guilty of some offense, suffers from a contagious disease or
       psychological disorder, is unfit for public office because of moral
       failings or an inability to discharge his or her duties, or lacks
       integrity in profession, trade or business;
    2. That the charge must be false;
    3. That the charge must be articulated to a third person, verbally or
       in writing;
    4. That the words are not subject to legal protection, such as those
       uttered in Congress; and
    5. That the charge must be motivated by malice.

   An action of libel required the same five general points as slander,
   except that it specifically involved the publication of defamatory
   statements.^[166] For certain criminal charges of libel, such as
   seditious libel, the truth or falsity of the statements was immaterial,
   as such laws were intended to maintain public support of the government
   and true statements could damage this support even more than false
   ones.^[167] Instead, libel placed specific emphasis on the result of
   the publication. Libelous publications tended to "degrade and injure
   another person" or "bring him into contempt, hatred or ridicule."^[166]

   Concerns that defamation under common law might be incompatible with
   the new republican form of government caused early American courts to
   struggle between William Blackstone's argument that the punishment of
   "dangerous or offensive writings ... [was] necessary for the
   preservation of peace and good order, of government and religion, the
   only solid foundations of civil liberty" and the argument that the need
   for a free press guaranteed by the Constitution outweighed the fear of
   what might be written.^[167] Consequently, very few changes were made
   in the first two centuries after the ratification of the First
   Amendment.

   The Supreme Court's ruling in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan
   (1964)^[44] fundamentally changed American defamation law. The case
   redefined the type of "malice" needed to sustain a libel case. Common
   law malice consisted of "ill-will" or "wickedness". Now, a public
   officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a tortfeasor needed
   to prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that there was actual
   malice. The case involved an advertisement published in The New York
   Times indicating that officials in Montgomery, Alabama had acted
   violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans during the
   civil rights movement. The Montgomery Police Commissioner, L. B.
   Sullivan, sued the Times for libel, stating that the advertisement
   damaged his reputation. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the
   $500,000 judgment against the Times. Justice Brennan suggested that
   public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the
   statements in question with "actual malice"—"knowledge that it was
   false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or
   not."^[168]^[169] In sum, the court held that "the First Amendment
   protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the
   conduct of public officials except when statements are made with actual
   malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of
   their truth or falsity)."^[170]

   While actual malice standard applies to public officials and public
   figures,^[171] in Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps (1988),^[172] the
   Court found that, with regard to private individuals, the First
   Amendment does "not necessarily force any change in at least some
   features of the common-law landscape."^[173] In Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.
   v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc. (1985)^[174] the Court ruled that "actual
   malice" need not be shown in cases involving private individuals,
   holding that "[i]n light of the reduced constitutional value of speech
   involving no matters of public concern ... the state interest
   adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damages—even absent
   a showing of 'actual malice.'"^[175]^[176] In Gertz v. Robert Welch,
   Inc. (1974), the Court ruled that a private individual had to prove
   actual malice only to be awarded punitive damages, but not to seek
   actual damages.^[177]^[178] InHustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988),^[179]
   the Court extended the "actual malice" standard to intentional
   infliction of emotional distress in a ruling which protected parody, in
   this case a fake advertisement in Hustler suggesting that evangelist
   Jerry Falwell's first sexual experience had been with his mother in an
   outhouse. Since Falwell was a public figure, the Court ruled that
   "importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public
   interest and concern" was the paramount concern, and reversed the
   judgement Falwell had won against Hustler for emotional distress.^[180]

   In Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. (1990),^[181] the Court ruled that
   the First Amendment offers no wholesale exception to defamation law for
   statements labeled "opinion," but instead that a statement must be
   provably false (falsifiable) before it can be the subject of a libel
   suit.^[182]

Private action

   State constitutions provide free speech protections similar to those of
   the U.S. Constitution. In a few states, such as California, a state
   constitution has been interpreted as providing more comprehensive
   protections than the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has permitted
   states to extend such enhanced protections, most notably in Pruneyard
   Shopping Center v. Robins.^[183] In that case, the Court unanimously
   ruled that while the First Amendment may allow private property owners
   to prohibit trespass by political speakers and petition-gatherers,
   California was permitted to restrict property owners whose property is
   equivalent to a traditional public forum (often shopping malls and
   grocery stores) from enforcing their private property rights to exclude
   such individuals.^[184] However, the Court did maintain that shopping
   centers could impose "reasonable restrictions on expressive
   activity."^[185] Subsequently, New Jersey, Colorado, Massachusetts and
   Puerto Rico courts have adopted the doctrine;^[186]^[187] California's
   courts have repeatedly reaffirmed it.^[188]

Freedom of the press

   Main article: Freedom of the press in the United States

   The Free Press Clause protects the right of individuals to express
   themselves through publication and dissemination of information, ideas
   and opinions without interference, constraint or prosecution by the
   government.^[189]^[190] This right was described in Branzburg v. Hayes
   as "a fundamental personal right" that is not confined to newspapers
   and periodicals.^[191] In Lovell v. City of Griffin (1938),^[192] Chief
   Justice Charles Evans Hughes defined "press" as "every sort of
   publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion."^[193]
   This right has been extended to media including newspapers, books,
   plays, movies, and video games.^[194] While it is an open question
   whether people who blog or use social media are journalists entitled to
   protection by media shield laws,^[195] they are protected equally by
   the Free Speech Clause and the Free Press Clause, because both clauses
   do not distinguish between media businesses and nonprofessional
   speakers.^[189]^[190]^[196]^[197] This is further shown by the Supreme
   Court consistently refusing to recognize the First Amendment as
   providing greater protection to the institutional media than to other
   speakers.^[198]^[199]^[200] For example, in a case involving campaign
   finance laws the Court rejected the "suggestion that communication by
   corporate members of the institutional press is entitled to greater
   constitutional protection than the same communication by"
   non-institutional-press businesses.^[201]

   A landmark decision for press freedom came in Near v. Minnesota
   (1931),^[202] in which the Supreme Court rejected prior restraint
   (pre-publication censorship). In this case, the Minnesota legislature
   passed a statute allowing courts to shut down "malicious, scandalous
   and defamatory newspapers", allowing a defense of truth only in cases
   where the truth had been told "with good motives and for justifiable
   ends".^[203] In a 5–4 decision, the Court applied the Free Press Clause
   to the states, rejecting the statute as unconstitutional. Hughes quoted
   Madison in the majority decision, writing, "The impairment of the
   fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and
   official neglect emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and
   courageous press".^[204]
   The leak of the Pentagon Papers by Daniel Ellsberg (pictured here in
   2006) led to New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), a landmark
   press freedom decision.

   However, Near also noted an exception, allowing prior restraint in
   cases such as "publication of sailing dates of transports or the number
   or location of troops".^[205] This exception was a key point in another
   landmark case four decades later: New York Times Co. v. United States
   (1971),^[206] in which the administration of President Richard Nixon
   sought to ban the publication of the Pentagon Papers, classified
   government documents about the Vietnam War secretly copied by analyst
   Daniel Ellsberg. The Court found, 6–3, that the Nixon administration
   had not met the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint.
   Justice Brennan, drawing on Near in a concurrent opinion, wrote that
   "only governmental allegation and proof that publication must
   inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an evil
   kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can
   support even the issuance of an interim restraining order." Justices
   Black and Douglas went still further, writing that prior restraints
   were never justified.^[207]

   The courts have rarely treated content-based regulation of journalism
   with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo
   (1974),^[208] the Court unanimously struck down a state law requiring
   newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses.
   The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic
   responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not
   responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that
   the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do
   not desire to publish.^[209]

   Content-based regulation of television and radio, however, have been
   sustained by the Supreme Court in various cases. Since there is a
   limited number of frequencies for non-cable television and radio
   stations, the government licenses them to various companies. However,
   the Supreme Court has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not allow
   the raising of a First Amendment issue. The government may restrain
   broadcasters, but only on a content-neutral basis. In Federal
   Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation,^[210] the Supreme
   Court upheld the Federal Communications Commission's authority to
   restrict the use of "indecent" material in broadcasting.

   State governments retain the right to tax newspapers, just as they may
   tax other commercial products. Generally, however, taxes that focus
   exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional. In Grosjean
   v. American Press Co. (1936),^[211] the Court invalidated a state tax
   on newspaper advertising revenues, holding that the role of the press
   in creating "informed public opinion" was vital.^[212] Similarly, some
   taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck
   down. In Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland (1987),^[213] for
   instance, the Court invalidated an Arkansas law exempting "religious,
   professional, trade and sports journals" from taxation since the law
   amounted to the regulation of newspaper content. In Leathers v. Medlock
   (1991),^[214] the Supreme Court found that states may treat different
   types of the media differently, such as by taxing cable television, but
   not newspapers. The Court found that "differential taxation of
   speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First
   Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of
   suppressing, particular ideas."^[215]

   In Branzburg v. Hayes (1972),^[216] the Court ruled that the First
   Amendment did not give a journalist the right to refuse a subpoena from
   a grand jury. The issue decided in the case was whether a journalist
   could refuse to "appear and testify before state and Federal grand
   juries" basing the refusal on the belief that such appearance and
   testimony "abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the
   First Amendment."^[217] The 5–4 decision was that such a protection was
   not provided by the First Amendment. However, a concurring opinion by
   Justice Lewis F. Powell, in which he stated that a claim for press
   privilege "should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper
   balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens
   to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. The
   balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a
   case-by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of
   adjudicating such questions.", has been frequently cited by lower
   courts since the decision.^[218]

Petition and assembly

   Main articles: Right to petition in the United States and Freedom of
   assembly
   Chief Justice Morrison Waite ruled in United States v. Cruikshank that
   the right of assembly was a secondary right to the right to petition.

   The Petition Clause protects the right "to petition the government for
   a redress of grievances."^[14] This includes the right to communicate
   with government officials, lobbying government officials and
   petitioning the courts by filing lawsuits with a legal basis.^[197] The
   Petition Clause first came to prominence in the 1830s, when Congress
   established the gag rule barring anti-slavery petitions from being
   heard; the rule was overturned by Congress several years later.
   Petitions against the Espionage Act of 1917 resulted in imprisonments.
   The Supreme Court did not rule on either issue.^[219]

   In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508
   (1972), the Supreme Court stated that the right to petition encompass
   "the approach of citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies
   (which are both creatures of the legislature, and arms of the
   executive) and to courts, the third branch of Government. Certainly the
   right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The
   right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of
   petition." Today thus this right encompasses petitions to all three
   branches of the federal government—the Congress, the executive and the
   judiciary—and has been extended to the states through
   incorporation.^[219]^[220] According to the Supreme Court, "redress of
   grievances" is to be construed broadly: it includes not solely appeals
   by the public to the government for the redressing of a grievance in
   the traditional sense, but also, petitions on behalf of private
   interests seeking personal gain.^[221] The right not only protects
   demands for "a redress of grievances" but also demands for government
   action.^[219]^[221] The petition clause includes according to the
   Supreme Court the opportunity to institute non-frivolous lawsuits and
   mobilize popular support to change existing laws in a peaceful
   manner.^[220]

   In Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri (2011),^[222] the Supreme Court
   stated regarding the Free Speech Clause and the Petition Clause:

     It is not necessary to say that the two Clauses are identical in
     their mandate or their purpose and effect to acknowledge that the
     rights of speech and petition share substantial common ground...
     Both speech and petition are integral to the democratic process,
     although not necessarily in the same way. The right to petition
     allows citizens to express their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their
     government and their elected representatives, whereas the right to
     speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is integral to
     deliberative democracy as well as to the whole realm of ideas and
     human affairs. Beyond the political sphere, both speech and petition
     advance personal expression, although the right to petition is
     generally concerned with expression directed to the government
     seeking redress of a grievance.^[14]

   The right of assembly was originally distinguished from the right to
   petition. In United States v. Cruikshank (1875),^[223] the Supreme
   Court held that "the right of the people peaceably to assemble for the
   purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or for
   anything else connected with the powers or duties of the National
   Government, is an attribute of national citizenship, and, as such,
   under protection of, and guaranteed by, the United States. The very
   idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part
   of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public
   affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances."^[224] Justice
   Morrison Waite's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the
   right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to
   petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid
   less attention to these distinctions.^[219]

   In two 1960s decisions collectively known as forming the
   Noerr-Pennington doctrine,^[b] the Court established that the right to
   petition prohibited the application of antitrust law to statements made
   by private entities before public bodies: a monopolist may freely go
   before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor's
   building permit without being subject to Sherman Act liability.^[225]

Freedom of association

   Further information: Freedom of association

   Although the First Amendment does not explicitly mention freedom of
   association, the Supreme Court ruled, in National Association for the
   Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama (1958),^[226]^[227] that this
   freedom was protected by the Amendment and that privacy of membership
   was an essential part of this freedom.^[228] The U.S. Supreme Court
   decided in Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) that "implicit in
   the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment" is
   "a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide
   variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and
   cultural ends."^[229] In Roberts the Court held that associations may
   not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group's expression,
   such as gender.^[230]

   However, in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group
   of Boston (1995),^[231] the Court ruled that a group may exclude people
   from membership if their presence would affect the group's ability to
   advocate a particular point of view.^[232] Likewise, in Boy Scouts of
   America v. Dale (2000),^[233] the Court ruled that a New Jersey law,
   which forced the Boy Scouts of America to admit an openly gay member,
   to be an unconstitutional abridgment of the Boy Scouts' right to free
   association.^[234]
