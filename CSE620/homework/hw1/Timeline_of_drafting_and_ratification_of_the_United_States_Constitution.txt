   The following is a timeline of the drafting and ratification of the
   United States Constitution. The drafting of the Constitution began on
   May 25, 1787, when the Constitutional Convention met for the first time
   with a quorum at the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall)
   in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation, and ended on
   September 17, 1787, the day the Constitution drafted by the
   convention's delegates to replace the Articles was adopted and signed.
   The ratification process for the Constitution began that day, and ended
   when the final state, Rhode Island, ratified it on May 29, 1790, three
   years later. In addition to key events during the Constitutional
   Convention and afterward while the Constitution was before the states
   for their ratification, important events that occurred during the
   run-up to the convention and during the nation's transition from
   government under the Articles of Confederation to government under the
   Constitution are also included, as is the unique ratification vote of
   Vermont. Thus this timeline begins on March 25, 1785, the date when the
   Mount Vernon Conference, a meeting of delegates from Virginia and
   Maryland to discuss interstate commercial issues along their mutual
   water border, convened, and ends on January 10, 1791, when Vermont,
   which at the time was a sovereign state, voted to ratify the
   Constitution and to apply for admission into the Union.
