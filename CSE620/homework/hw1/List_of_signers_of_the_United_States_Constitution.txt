   Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, by
   Howard Chandler Christy

   Signers of the United States Constitution, the supreme law of the
   United States, include 39 of 55 delegates who attended the
   Constitutional Convention, and the convention's secretary, William
   Jackson, who signed the document to authenticate the results of the
   Convention's sessions.^[1] The Constitution, called the most important
   document in American history, describes the branches of the United
   States government and how the government should be operated.^[2] It was
   signed on September 17, 1787, in Independence Hall, Philadelphia, with
   all of the original Thirteen Colonies members sending representatives,
   with the exception of Rhode Island.^[3]

   Of the constitution's 40 signers, 23 were veterans of the Revolutionary
   War.^[1] Jonathan Dayton was the youngest to sign the Constitution, at
   the age of 26, while Benjamin Franklin, at the age of 81, was the
   oldest.^[3] Connecticut's Roger Sherman also signed the Articles of
   Association, the Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of
   Confederation, making him the only person to sign all four
   documents.^[4] Six other signatories' names are on the Declaration of
   Independence, while another four are on the Articles of Confederation.
