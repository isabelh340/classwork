   Religion in the United States (2012)^[1]
     Christianity (73%)
     Other religions (6%)
     Non-religious (19.6%)
     Do not know/not stated (1.4%)

   Religion in the United States is characterized by a diversity of
   religious beliefs and practices. Various religious faiths have
   flourished, as well as perished, in the United States. A majority of
   Americans report that religion plays a "very important" role in their
   lives, a proportion unique among developed countries.^[2]

   The majority of Americans (73%) identify themselves as Christians and
   about 20% have no religious affiliation.^[1] According to the American
   Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) of 2008, 76% of the American
   adult population identified themselves as Christians, with 51%
   professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered
   Protestant or unaffiliated, and 25% professing Catholic
   beliefs.^[3]^[4] The same survey says that other religions (including,
   for example, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make
   up about 4% of the adult population, another 15% of the adult
   population claim no religious affiliation, and 5.2% said they did not
   know, or they refused to reply.^[3] According to a 2012 survey by the
   Pew forum, 36 percent of Americans state that they attend services
   nearly every week or more.^[5]

Overview[edit]

   From early colonial days, when some English and German settlers came in
   search of religious freedom, America has been profoundly influenced by
   religion.^[6] That influence continues in American culture, social
   life, and politics.^[7] Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were
   established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion
   within a community of like-minded people: the Massachusetts Bay Colony
   was established by English Puritans (Congregationalists), Pennsylvania
   by British Quakers, Maryland by English Catholics, and Virginia by
   English Anglicans. Despite these, and as a result of intervening
   religious strife and preference in England^[8] the Plantation Act 1740
   would set official policy for new immigrants coming to British America
   until the American Revolution.

   The text of the First Amendment to the country's Constitution states
   that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the
   freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
   peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
   grievances." It guarantees the free exercise of religion while also
   preventing the government from establishing a state religion. The
   Supreme Court has also interpreted this as preventing the government
   from having any authority in religion.

   According to a 2002 survey by the Pew forum, nearly 6 in 10 Americans
   said that religion plays an important role in their lives, compared to
   33% in Great Britain, 27% in Italy, 21% in Germany, 12% in Japan and
   11% in France. The survey report stated that the results showed America
   having a greater similarity to developing nations (where higher
   percentages say that religion plays an important role) than to other
   wealthy nations, where religion plays a minor role.^[2]

   In 1963, 90% of Americans claimed to be Christians while only 2%
   professed no religious identity.^[9] In 2012, the percentage of
   Christians was closer to 70% with close to 20% claiming no religious
   identity.^[1]

Freedom of religion[edit]

   Although some New England States continued to use tax money to fund
   local Congregational churches into the 1830s, the United States claims
   to have been the first nation to have no official state-endorsed
   religion.^[10]

   Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute
   for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any
   religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied
   the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an
   establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus
   protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination
   from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by
   European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence
   of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states
   that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national
   religion that did not represent them.^[11]

Abrahamic religions[edit]

Christianity[edit]

   Main article: Christianity in the United States

   The largest religion in the US is Christianity, claimed by the majority
   of the population (73% in 2012^[12]). From those queried, roughly 48%
   of Americans are Protestants, 22% are Catholics, 2% are Mormons (the
   name commonly used to refer to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of
   Latter-day Saints), and 1% have affiliations with various other
   Christian denominations.^[13]^[14] Christianity was introduced during
   the period of European colonization.

   D.C.

   According to the 2011 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, from
   which members in the United States are combined with Canadian members,
   and of the National Council of Churches, the five largest denominations
   are:^[15]
     * The Catholic Church, 68,503,456 members
     * The Southern Baptist Convention, 16,160,088 members
     * The United Methodist Church, 7,774,931 members
     * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6,321,416 ^[16]
       members
     * The Church of God in Christ, 5,499,875 members

   The Southern Baptist Convention, with over 16 million adherents, is the
   largest of more than 200^[17] distinctly named Protestant
   denominations.^[18] In 2007, members of Evangelical Churches comprised
   26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline
   Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black
   churches.^[citation needed]

   Beginning in the 17th century, Northern European peoples introduced
   Protestantism. Among Protestants, Anglicans, Baptists, Puritans,
   Presbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers, and Moravians were the first to
   settle in the US, spreading their faith in the new country.

   Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish (and later the French and
   English) introduced Catholicism. From the 19th century to the present,
   Catholics came to the US in large numbers due to immigration of
   Italians, Hispanics, Portuguese, French, Polish, Irish, Highland Scots,
   Dutch, Flemish, Hungarians, Germans, Lebanese, and other ethnic groups.

   Greek, Ukrainian, Russian, Central and Eastern European, Middle
   Eastern, Ethiopian, and South Indian immigrants brought Eastern
   Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy to the United States. These branches
   of Christianity have since spread beyond the boundaries of ethnic
   immigrant communities and now include multi-ethnic membership and
   parishes.

   Several Christian groups were founded in America during the Great
   Awakenings. Interdenominational evangelicalism and Pentecostalism
   emerged; new Protestant denominations such as Adventism;
   non-denominational movements such as the Restoration Movement (which
   over time separated into the Churches of Christ the Christian churches
   and churches of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of
   Christ)); Jehovah's Witnesses (called 'Bible Students' in the later
   part of the 19th century); and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
   Saints (Mormonism).
   The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in
   Washington, D.C., is the largest Catholic church in the US

   The strength of various sects varies greatly in different regions of
   the country, with rural parts of the South (except Louisiana and the
   Gulf Coast, and the Hispanic community, which both consist mainly of
   Catholics), having many evangelicals but very few Catholics, while
   urbanized areas of the north Atlantic states and Great Lakes, as well
   as many industrial and mining towns, are heavily Catholic, though still
   quite mixed, especially due to the heavily Protestant African-American
   communities. In 1990, nearly 72% of the population of Utah was Mormon,
   as well as 26% of neighboring Idaho.^[19] Lutheranism is most prominent
   in the Upper Midwest, with North Dakota having the highest percentage
   of Lutherans (35% according to a 2001 survey.^[20])

   Despite its status as the most widespread and influential religion in
   the US, Christianity has undergone a continuous relative decline in
   demographics. While the absolute number of Christians rose from 1990 to
   2008 as the overall population increased, the actual percentage of
   Christians dropped from 86% to 76%.^[3] A nationwide telephone
   interview of 1,002 adults conducted by The Barna Group found that 70%
   of American adults believe that God is "the all-powerful, all-knowing
   creator of the universe who still rules it today", and that 9% of all
   American adults and 0.5% young adults hold to what the survey defined
   as a "biblical worldview".^[21]

Judaism[edit]

   Main article: American Jews

   After Christianity, Judaism is the next largest religious affiliation
   in the US, though this identification is not necessarily indicative of
   religious beliefs or practices.^[3] There are between 5.3 and 6.6
   million Jews. A significant number of people identify themselves as
   American Jews on ethnic and cultural grounds, rather than religious
   ones. For example, 19% of self-identified American Jews believe God
   does not exist.^[22] The 2001 ARIS study projected from its sample that
   there are about 5.3 million adults in the American Jewish population:
   2.83 million adults (1.4% of the U.S. adult population) are estimated
   to be adherents of Judaism; 1.08 million are estimated to be adherents
   of no religion; and 1.36 million are estimated to be adherents of a
   religion other than Judaism.^[23] ARIS 2008 estimated about 2.68
   million adults (1.2%) in the country identify Judaism as their
   faith.^[3]
   Touro Synagogue, (built 1759) in Newport, Rhode Island has the oldest
   still existing synagogue building in the United States.

   Jews have been present in what is now the US since the 17th century,
   and specifically allowed since the British colonial Plantation Act
   1740. Although small Western European communities initially developed
   and grew, large scale immigration did not take place until the late
   19th century, largely as a result of persecutions in parts of Eastern
   Europe. The Jewish community in the United States is composed
   predominantly of Ashkenazi Jews whose ancestors emigrated from Central
   and Eastern Europe. There are, however, small numbers of older (and
   some recently arrived) communities of Sephardi Jews with roots tracing
   back to 15th century Iberia (Spain, Portugal, and North Africa). There
   are also Mizrahi Jews (from the Middle East, Caucasia and Central
   Asia), as well as much smaller numbers of Ethiopian Jews, Indian Jews,
   Kaifeng Jews and others from various smaller Jewish ethnic divisions.
   Approximately 25% of the Jewish American population lives in New York
   City.^[24]

   According to a 2007 survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and
   Public life, 1.7% of adults in the U.S. identify Judaism as their
   religion. Among those surveyed, 43% said they were Reform Jews, 31%
   said they were Conservative Jews, and 10% said they were Orthodox
   Jews.^[25]^[26] According to the 1990 National Jewish Population
   Survey, 38% of Jews were affiliated with the Reform tradition, 35% were
   Conservative, 6% were Orthodox, 1% were Reconstructionists, 10% linked
   themselves to some other tradition, and 10% said they are "just
   Jewish."^[27]

   The Pew Research Center report on American Judaism released in October
   2013 revealed that 22% of Jewish Americans say they have “no religion”
   and the majority of respondents do not see religion as the primary
   constituent of Jewish identity. 62% believe Jewish identity is based
   primarily in ancestry and culture, only 15% in religion. Among Jews who
   gave Judaism as their religion, 55% based Jewish identity on ancestry
   and culture, and 66% did not view belief in God as essential to
   Judaism.^[28]

   A 2009 study estimated the Jewish population (including both those who
   define themselves as Jewish by religion and those who define themselves
   as Jewish in cultural or ethnic terms) to be between 6.0 and 6.4
   million.^[29] According to a study done in 2000 there were an estimated
   6.14 million Jewish people in the country, about 2% of the
   population.^[30]
   Congregation Shearith Israel, (founded 1655) in New York is the oldest
   Jewish congregation in the United States.

   According to the 2001 National Jewish Population Survey, 4.3 million
   American Jewish adults have some sort of strong connection to the
   Jewish community, whether religious or cultural.^[31] Jewishness is
   generally considered an ethnic identity as well as a religious one.
   Among the 4.3 million American Jews described as "strongly connected"
   to Judaism, over 80% have some sort of active engagement with Judaism,
   ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the
   spectrum to attending Passover Seders or lighting Hanukkah candles on
   the other. The survey also discovered that Jews in the Northeast and
   Midwest are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West.
   Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups, Jews in
   the Northwestern United States are typically the least observant of
   tradition.

   Beginning in the 1960s, a worldwide movement among previously secular
   Jews, called baalei teshuva ("returners", returning to a more
   religious, in most cases, Orthodox, style of observance) has had a
   noticeable presence in America.^[32] It is uncertain how widespread or
   demographically important this movement is at present.

Islam[edit]

   Main article: Islam in the United States
   The Islamic Center of Washington in the nation's capital is a leading
   American Islamic Center.

   Islam is the third largest faith in the United States, after
   Christianity and Judaism, representing 0.8% of the
   population.^[33]^[34] Islam in America effectively began with the
   arrival of African slaves. It is estimated that about 10% of African
   slaves transported to the United States were Muslim.^[35] Most,
   however, became Christians, and the United States did not have a
   significant Muslim population until the arrival of immigrants from Arab
   and East Asian Muslim areas.^[36] According to some experts,^[37] Islam
   later gained a higher profile through the Nation of Islam, a religious
   group that appealed to black Americans after the 1940s; its prominent
   converts included Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali.^[38]^[39] The first
   Muslim elected in Congress was Keith Ellison in 2006,^[40] followed by
   Andre Carson in 2008.^[41]
   The Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan is the largest
   mosque in the United States

   Research indicates that Muslims in the United States are generally more
   assimilated and prosperous than their counterparts in
   Europe.^[42]^[43]^[44] Like other subcultural and religious
   communities, the Islamic community has generated its own political
   organizations and charity organizations.

Bahá'í Faith[edit]

   Main article: Bahá'í_Faith_in_North_America § United_States
   Bahá'í House of Worship, (built 1953) in Wilmette, Illinois is the
   oldest still existing Bahá'í House of Worship in the world and the only
   one in the United States.

   The United States has perhaps the second largest Bahá'í community in
   the world. First mention of the Faith in the U.S. was at the inaugural
   Parliament of World Religions, which was held at the Columbian
   Exposition in Chicago in 1893. In 1894, Ibrahim Kheiralla, a Syrian
   Bahá'í immigrant established a community in the U.S. He later left the
   main group and founded a rival movement.^[45]

Dharmic religions[edit]

Buddhism[edit]

   Main article: Buddhism in the United States
   Hsi Lai Temple (lit. Coming West Temple), a Buddhist monastery in
   Hacienda Heights, California, near Los Angeles

   Buddhism entered the US during the 19th century with the arrival of the
   first immigrants from East Asia. The first Buddhist temple was
   established in San Francisco in 1853 by Chinese Americans.

   During the late 19th century Buddhist missionaries from Japan came to
   the US. During the same time period, US intellectuals started to take
   interest in Buddhism.

   The first prominent US citizen to publicly convert to Buddhism was
   Henry Steel Olcott. An event that contributed to the strengthening of
   Buddhism in the US was the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893,
   which was attended by many Buddhist delegates sent from India, China,
   Japan,Vietnam, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

   The early 20th century was characterized by a continuation of
   tendencies that had their roots in the 19th century. The second half,
   by contrast, saw the emergence of new approaches, and the move of
   Buddhism into the mainstream and making itself a mass and social
   religious phenomenon.^[46]^[47]

   Many foreign associations and teachers—such as Soka Gakkai and Tenzin
   Gyatso (the 14th Dalai Lama for Tibetan Buddhism^[citation
   needed])—started to organize missionary activities, while US converts
   established the first Western-based Buddhist institutions, temples and
   worship groups.

   Estimates of the number of Buddhists in the United States vary between
   0.5%^[3] and 0.9%,^[48] with 0.7% reported by both the CIA^[25] and
   PEW.^[49]

Hinduism[edit]

   Main article: Hinduism in the United States
   Detail of Malibu Hindu Temple in Calabasas, California

   The first time Hinduism entered the US is not clearly identifiable.
   However, large groups of Hindus have immigrated from India and other
   Asian countries since the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality
   Act of 1965. During the 1960s and 1970s Hinduism exercised fascination
   contributing to the development of New Age thought. During the same
   decades the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (a
   Vaishnavite Hindu reform organization) was founded in the US.

   According to recent surveys, estimates for Hindus in the US suggest
   they number nearly 400 thousand people or about 0.2% of the total
   population.^[50]^[51]

   In 2004 the Hindu American Foundation—a national institution protecting
   rights the Hindu community of US—was founded.

Jainism[edit]

   Main article: Jainism in the United States
   Jain Center of Greater Phoenix (JCGP)

   Adherents of Jainism first arrived in the United States in the 20th
   century. The most significant time of Jain immigration was in the early
   1970s. The United States has since become a center of the Jain
   Diaspora. The Federation of Jain Associations in North America is an
   umbrella organization of local American and Canadian Jain congregations
   to preserve, practice, and promote Jainism and the Jain Way of
   Life.^[52]

Sikhism[edit]

   California.

   Around 1900, the state of Punjab of British India was hit hard by
   British practices of mercantilism. Some Sikhs emigrated to the United
   States to work on farms in California. They were the first community to
   come from India to the US in large numbers.^[53]

   The first Sikh Gurdwara in America was built in Stockton, California in
   1912.^[54]

No religion[edit]

   Main article: Irreligion in the United States

   This group includes atheists, agnostics and people who describe their
   religion as "nothing in particular".^[55]

   "Unaffiliated" does not necessarily mean "non-religious". Some people
   who are unaffiliated with any particular religion express religious
   beliefs (such as belief in God or reincarnation) and engage in
   religious practices (such as prayer).^[citation needed]

Agnosticism, atheism, and humanism[edit]

   A 2001 survey directed by Dr. Ariela Keysar for the City University of
   New York indicated that, amongst the more than 100 categories of
   response, "no religious identification" had the greatest increase in
   population in both absolute and percentage terms. This category
   included atheists, agnostics, humanists, and others with no theistic
   religious beliefs or practices. Figures are up from 14.3 million in
   1990 to 34.2 million in 2008, representing an increase from 8% of the
   total population in 1990 to 15% in 2008.^[3] A nation-wide Pew Research
   study published in 2008 put the figure of unaffiliated persons at
   16.1%,^[51] while another Pew study published in 2012 was described as
   placing the proportion at about 20% overall and roughly 33% for the
   18–29-year-old demographic.^[56]

   In a 2006 nationwide poll, University of Minnesota researchers found
   that despite an increasing acceptance of religious diversity, atheists
   were generally distrusted by other Americans, who trusted them less
   than Muslims, recent immigrants and other minority groups in "sharing
   their vision of American society". They also associated atheists with
   undesirable attributes such as criminal behavior, rampant materialism,
   and cultural elitism.^[57]^[58] However, the same study also reported
   that "The researchers also found acceptance or rejection of atheists is
   related not only to personal religiosity, but also to one's exposure to
   diversity, education and political orientation – with more educated,
   East and West Coast Americans more accepting of atheists than their
   Midwestern counterparts."^[59] Some surveys have indicated that doubts
   about the existence of a god were growing quickly among Americans under
   30.^[60]

   On 24 March 2012, American Atheists sponsored the Reason Rally in
   Washington D.C. This was followed by the American Atheist Convention at
   the Bethesda North Marriott and Convention Center in Bethesda, MD.
   Organizers called the estimated crowd of 8,000–10,000 the largest-ever
   US gathering of nonbelievers in one place.^[61]

Deism[edit]

   In the United States, Enlightenment philosophy (which itself was
   heavily inspired by deist ideals) played a major role in creating the
   principle of religious freedom, expressed in Thomas Jefferson's letters
   and included in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
   American Founding Fathers, or Framers of the Constitution, who were
   especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy of deism
   include Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Cornelius Harnett,
   Gouverneur Morris, and Hugh Williamson. Their political speeches show
   distinct deistic influence. Other notable Founding Fathers may have
   been more directly deist. These include Thomas Paine, James Madison,
   possibly Alexander Hamilton, and Ethan Allen,^[62]

Belief in the existence of a god[edit]

   Various polls have been conducted to determine Americans' actual
   beliefs regarding a god:
     * A 2006 CBS News Poll of 899 U.S. adults found that 76% of those
       surveyed believed in a god, while 9% believed in "some other
       universal spirit or higher power", 8% believed in neither, and 1%
       were unsure.^[citation needed]
     * A 2007 Gallup Poll found that 86% of Americans believe in a god,
       with 8% saying they are not sure, and 6% saying they don't believe
       in a god.^[citation needed]
     * According to a 2008 ARIS survey, belief in god varies considerably
       by region. The lowest rate is in the West with 59% reporting a
       belief in God, and the highest rate in the South at 86%.^[63]
     * Mark Chaves, a Duke University professor of sociology, religion and
       divinity, found that 92% of Americans believed in God in 2008, but
       that significantly fewer Americans have great confidence in their
       religious leaders than a generation ago.^[64]
     * A 2008 survey of 1,000 people concluded that, based on their stated
       beliefs rather than their religious identification, 69.5% of
       Americans believe in a personal God, roughly 12.3% of Americans are
       atheist or agnostic, and another 12.1% are deistic (believing in a
       higher power/non-personal God, but no personal God).^[3]
     * A late 2009 online Harris poll of 2,303 U.S. adults (18 and
       older)^[65] found that "82% of adult Americans believe in God", the
       same number as in two earlier polls in 2005 and 2007. Another 9%
       said they did not believe in God, and 9% said that they were not
       sure. It further concluded, "Large majorities also believe in
       miracles (76%), heaven (75%), that Jesus is God or the Son of God
       (73%), in angels (72%), the survival of the soul after death (71%),
       and in the resurrection of Jesus (70%). Less than half (45%) of
       adults believe in Darwin's theory of evolution but this is more
       than the 40% who believe in creationism..... Many people consider
       themselves Christians without necessarily believing in some of the
       key beliefs of Christianity. However, this is not true of
       born-again Christians. In addition to their religious beliefs,
       large minorities of adults, including many Christians, have "pagan"
       or pre-Christian beliefs such as a belief in ghosts, astrology,
       witches and reincarnation.... Because the sample is based on those
       who agreed to participate in the Harris Interactive panel, no
       estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."
     * A 2010 Gallup poll found 80% of Americans believe in a god, 12%
       believe in a universal spirit, 6% don't believe in either, 1% chose
       "other", and 1% had no opinion. This is down only
       slightly^[clarification needed] from the 1940s, when Gallup first
       asked this question.
     * A 2011 Gallup poll found 92% of Americans said yes to the basic
       question "Do you believe in God?", while 7% said no and 1% had no
       opinion.^[66]
     * A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that doubts about the
       existence of a god had grown among younger Americans, with 68%
       telling Pew they never doubt God's existence, a 15-point drop in
       five years. In 2007, 83% of American millennials said they never
       doubted God's existence.^[60]^[67]
     * A 2012 WIN-Gallup International poll showed that 5% of Americans
       considered themselves "convinced" atheists, which was a fivefold
       increase from the last time the survey was taken in 2005, and 5%
       said they did not know or else did not respond.^[68]

Others[edit]

   Many other religions are represented in the United States, including
   Shinto, Caodaism, Thelema, Santería, Kemetism, Religio Romana,
   Kaldanism, Zoroastrianism, Vodou, and many forms of New Age
   spirituality.

Native American religions[edit]

   Main article: Native American religion

   Native American religions historically exhibited much diversity, and
   are often characterized by animism or panentheism.^[69] The membership
   of Native American religions in the 21st century comprises about 9000
   people.^[70]

Neopaganism[edit]

   Main article: Contemporary Paganism

   Neopaganism in the United States is represented by widely different
   movements and organizations. The largest Neopagan religion is Wicca,
   followed by Neo-Druidism.^[71]^[72] Other neopagan movements include
   Germanic Neopaganism, Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, Hellenic
   Polytheistic Reconstructionism, and Semitic Neopaganism.

Druidry[edit]

   According to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), there
   are approximately 30,000 druids in the United States.^[73] Modern
   Druidism came to North America first in the form of fraternal Druidic
   organizations in the nineteenth century and orders such as the Ancient
   Order of Druids in America were founded as distinct American groups as
   early as 1912. In 1963, the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA) was
   founded by students at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. They
   adopted elements of Neopaganism into their practices, for instance
   celebrating the festivals of the Wheel of the Year.^[74]

Wicca[edit]

   Wicca advanced in North America in the 1960s by Raymond Buckland, an
   expatriate Briton who visited Gardner's Isle of Man coven to gain
   initiation.^[75] Universal Eclectic Wicca was popularized in 1969 a
   diverse membership drawing from both Dianic and British Traditional
   Wiccan backgrounds.^[76]

New Thought Movement[edit]

   Main article: New Thought

   A group of churches which started in the 1830s in the United States is
   known under the banner of "New Thought". These churches share a
   spiritual, metaphysical and mystical predisposition and understanding
   of the Bible and were strongly influenced by the Transcendentalist
   movement particularly the work of Emerson. Another antecedent of this
   movement was Swedenborgianism, founded on the writings of Emanuel
   Swedenborg in 1787.^[77] The New Thought concept was named by Emma
   Curtis Hopkins ("teacher of teachers") after Hopkins broke off from
   Mary Baker Eddy's Church of Christ, Scientist. The movement had been
   previously known as the Mental Sciences or The Christian Sciences. The
   three major branches are Religious Science, Unity Church and Divine
   Science.

Unitarian Universalism[edit]

   Main article: Unitarian Universalism

   Unitarian Universalists do not share a creed; rather, they are unified
   by their shared search for spiritual growth and by the understanding
   that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not
   obedience to an authoritarian requirement.^[78]

Taoism[edit]

   In 2004 there were an estimated 56,000 Taoists in the US.^[79] Taoism
   was popularized throughout the world through the practice of Tai Chi
   Chuan and other martial arts.^[80]

Major denominations founded in the United States[edit]

     * Anglican Church in North America – broke from the Episcopal Church
       in 2009 to protest against the latter denomination's liberalizing
       tendencies.
     * Calvary Chapel
     * Polish National Catholic Church – broke from Rome in 1897.
     * Churches of Christ/Disciples of Christ – a restoration movement
       with no governing body. The Restoration Movement solidified as a
       historical phenomenon in 1832 when restorationists from two major
       movements championed by Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell
       merged.
     * Pentecostalism – movement which emphasizes the role of the Holy
       Spirit, finds its historic roots in the Azusa Street Revival in Los
       Angeles, California, from 1904 to 1906, sparked by Charles Parham.
     * Adventism – began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most
       vocal leader was William Miller, who in the 1830s in New York
       became convinced of an imminent Second Coming of Jesus. The most
       prominent modern group to emerge from this is the Seventh-day
       Adventists.
     * Nation of Islam – A sect of Islam, created and followed solely by
       African-Americans; redefined "Allah" as someone "who came in the
       person of W. D. Fard."
     * The Latter Day Saint movement founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith in
       upstate New York. Multiple Latter Day Saint denomination can be
       found throughout the United States. The Church of Jesus Christ of
       Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest denomination, is
       headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Community of Christ, the
       second-largest denomination, is headquartered in Independence,
       Missouri.
     * New Thought Movement – two of the early proponents of New Thought
       beliefs during the mid to late 19th century were Phineas Parkhurst
       Quimby and the Mother of New Thought Emma Curtis Hopkins. The three
       major branches are Religious Science, Unity Church and Divine
       Science.
     * Jehovah's Witnesses – originated with the religious movement known
       as Bible Students, which was founded in Pennsylvania in the late
       1870s by Charles Taze Russell. Loosely connected in its early years
       with Adventism, with which it shares some similarities.
     * Scientology – founded by L. Ron Hubbard.
     * Christian Science – founded by Mary Baker Eddy.
     * Reconstructionist Judaism – founded by Mordecai Kaplan.
     * Native American Church – founded by Quanah Parker beginning in the
       1890s and incorporating in 1918.
     * Church Of Satan – founded by Anton LaVey in San Francisco,
       California, 1966.
     * Metropolitan Community Church – founded by Troy Perry in Los
       Angeles, California, 1968.

Government positions[edit]

   The First Amendment guarantees both the free practice of religion and
   the non-establishment of religion by the federal government (later
   court decisions have extended that prohibition to the states).^[81] The
   U.S. Pledge of Allegiance was modified in 1954 to add the phrase "under
   God", in order to distinguish itself from the state atheism espoused by
   the Soviet Union.^[82]^[83]^[84]^[85]

   Various American presidents have often stated the importance of
   religion. On February 20, 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower stated
   that "Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first, the most basic,
   expression of Americanism."^[86] President Gerald Ford agreed with and
   repeated this statement in 1974.^[87]

Statistics[edit]

   The U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Various groups have
   conducted surveys to determine approximate percentages of those
   affiliated with each religious group. Some surveys ask people to
   self-identify, while others calculate church memberships. The first
   table below represents the ranges that have been found.
     * Christianity: (59.9%^[30] to 78.4%^[88])
     * Unaffiliated, including atheist or agnostic (15.0%^[3] to
       37.3%^[30])
     * Judaism (1.2%^[3] to 2.2%^[30])
     * Islam (0.6%^[3]^[25]^[30]^[49])
     * Buddhism (0.5%^[3] to 0.9%^[48])
     * Hinduism (0.4%)
     * Unitarian Universalism (0.3%)^[89]
     * Wicca/Paganism/Druidry (0.1%)^[89]

Attendance[edit]

   Church or synagogue attendance by state.

   A 2013 survey reported that 31% Americans attend religious services at
   least weekly. It was conducted by the Public Religion Research
   Institute with a margin of error of 2.5.^[90]

   In 2006, an online Harris Poll (they stated that the magnitude of
   errors cannot be estimated due to sampling errors, non-response,etc.;
   2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed)^[91] found that 26% of those surveyed
   attended religious services "every week or more often", 9% went "once
   or twice a month", 21% went "a few times a year", 3% went "once a
   year", 22% went "less than once a year", and 18% never attend religious
   services.

   In a 2009 Gallup International survey, 41.6%^[92] of American citizens
   said that they attended church or synagogue once a week or almost every
   week. This percentage is higher than other surveyed Western
   countries.^[93]^[94] Church attendance varies considerably by state and
   region. The figures ranged from 63% in Mississippi to 23% in Vermont.

Religion and politics[edit]

   Main article: Religion and politics in the United States
   See also: Religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States and
   Religious affiliation in the United States Senate
   The U.S. guarantees freedom of religion and some churches in the U.S.
   take strong stances on political subjects.

   In August 2010 67% of Americans said religion is losing influence,
   compared with 59% who said this in 2006. Majorities of white
   evangelical Protestants (79%), while mainline Protestants (67%), Black
   Protestants (56%), Catholics (71%), and the religiously unaffiliated
   (62%) all agree that religion is losing influence on American life; 53%
   of the total public says this is a bad thing while just 10% see it as a
   good thing.^[95]

   Politicians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning, and
   Fundamentalist and Black Protestants are highly politically active.
   However, to keep their status as tax-exempt organizations they must not
   officially endorse a candidate. Historically Catholics were heavily
   Democrats before the 1970s, while mainline Protestants comprised the
   core of the Republican Party. Those patterns have faded away—Catholics,
   for example, now split about 50–50. However, white evangelicals since
   1980 have made up a solidly Republican group that favors conservative
   candidates. Secular voters are increasingly Democratic.^[96]

   Only three presidential candidates for major parties have been
   Catholics, all for the Democratic party:
     * Alfred E. Smith in presidential election of 1928 was subjected to
       anti-Catholic rhetoric, which seriously hurt him in the Baptist
       areas of the South and Lutheran areas of the Midwest, but he did
       well in the Catholic urban strongholds of the Northeast.
     * John F. Kennedy secured the Democratic presidential nomination in
       1960. In the 1960 election, Kennedy faced accusations that as a
       Catholic President he would do as the Pope would tell him to do, a
       charge that Kennedy refuted in a famous address to Protestant
       ministers.
     * John Kerry won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. In
       the 2004 election religion was hardly an issue, and most Catholics
       voted for his Protestant opponent.^[97]

   Joe Biden is the first Catholic vice president.^[98]

   The only Jewish major party candidate was Joe Lieberman in the
   Gore-Lieberman campaign of 2000 (although John Kerry and Barry
   Goldwater both had Jewish ancestry).

   In 2006 Keith Ellison of Minnesota became the first Muslim elected to
   Congress; when re-enacting his swearing-in for photos, he used the copy
   of the Qur'an once owned by Thomas Jefferson.^[99]

   A Gallup Poll released in 2007^[100] indicated that 53% of Americans
   would refuse to vote for an atheist as president, up from 48% in 1987
   and 1999.

   The 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is Mormon and a
   member of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is
   the former governor of the state of Massachusetts and his father George
   Romney was the governor of the state of Michigan. The Romneys were
   involved in Mormonism in their states and in the state of Utah.

ARDA survey[edit]

   The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) surveyed congregations
   for their memberships. Churches were asked for their membership
   numbers. Adjustments were made for those congregations that did not
   respond and for religious groups that reported only adult
   membership.^[102] ARDA estimates that most of the churches not
   responding were black Protestant congregations. Significant difference
   in results from other databases include the lower representation of
   adherents of 1> all kinds (62.7%), 2>Christians (59.9%) 3>Protestants
   (less than 36%); and the greater number of unaffiliated (37.3%).
   Plurality of religious preference by state, 2001. Data are unavailable
   for Alaska and Hawaii.
   Percentage of religion against average, 2001.
   Percentage of state populations that identify with a religion rather
   than "no religion", 2001.

ARIS findings regarding self-identification[edit]

   The United States government does not collect religious data in its
   census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey
   (ARIS) of 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461
   American residential households in the contiguous United States. The
   1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.

   Adult respondents were asked the open-ended question, "What is your
   religion, if any?" Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested
   list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was
   also asked. If the initial answer was "Protestant" or "Christian"
   further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination.
   About one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic
   questions.

   Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001,
   2008^[3]
   Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect
   refusals are possibly more representative of "no religion" than any
   other group.

   Highlights:^[3]
    1. The ARIS 2008 survey was carried out during February–November 2008
       and collected answers from 54,461 respondents who were questioned
       in English or Spanish.
    2. The American population self-identifies as predominantly Christian
       but Americans are slowly becoming less Christian.
          + 86% of American adults identified as Christians in 1990 and
            76% in 2008.
          + The historic Mainline churches and denominations have
            experienced the steepest declines while the non-denominational
            Christian identity has been trending upward particularly since
            2001.
          + The challenge to Christianity in the U.S. does not come from
            other religions but rather from a rejection of all forms of
            organized religion.
    3. 34% of American adults considered themselves "Born Again or
       Evangelical Christians" in 2008.
    4. The U. S. population continues to show signs of becoming less
       religious, with one out of every seven Americans failing to
       indicate a religious identity in 2008.
          + The "Nones" (no stated religious preference, atheist, or
            agnostic) continue to grow, though at a much slower pace than
            in the 1990s, from 8.2% in 1990, to 14.1% in 2001, to 15.0% in
            2008.
          + Asian Americans are substantially more likely to indicate no
            religious identity than other racial or ethnic groups.
    5. One sign of the lack of attachment of Americans to religion is that
       27% do not expect a religious funeral at their death.
    6. Based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious
       identification in 2008, 70% of Americans believe in a personal God,
       roughly 12% of Americans are atheist (no God) or agnostic
       (unknowable or unsure), and another 12% are deistic (a higher power
       but no personal God).
    7. America's religious geography has been transformed since 1990.
       Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has
       significantly changed the religious profile of some states and
       regions. Between 1990 and 2008, the Catholic population proportion
       of the New England states fell from 50% to 36% and in New York it
       fell from 44% to 37%, while it rose in California from 29% to 37%
       and in Texas from 23% to 32%.
    8. Overall the 1990–2008 ARIS time series shows that changes in
       religious self-identification in the first decade of the 21st
       century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s, which was a
       period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the
       United States.

Ethnicity[edit]

   The table below shows the religious affiliations among the ethnicities
   in the United States, according to the Pew Forum 2007 survey.^[104]
   People of Black ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal
   religion, with 85% percent being Christians. Protestant denominations
   make up the majority of the Christians in the ethnicities.
