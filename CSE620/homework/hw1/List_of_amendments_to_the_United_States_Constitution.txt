   1920 Tennessee certificate of ratification of the 19th Amendment.
   Tennessee was the 36th state to ratify the amendment, that being the
   number of states required for full implementation.

   This is the complete list of the thirty-three amendments to the United
   States Constitution which have been adopted by the United States
   Congress and sent to the states for ratification since the Constitution
   was put into operation on March 4, 1789. Twenty-seven of these, having
   been ratified by the requisite number of states, are part of the
   Constitution. The first ten amendments were adopted and ratified
   simultaneously and are known collectively as the Bill of Rights. Six
   amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been
   ratified by the required number of states. Four of these amendments are
   still technically open and pending, one is closed and has failed by its
   own terms, and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the
   resolution proposing it.

   Approximately 11,539 proposals to amend the Constitution have been
   introduced in Congress since 1789.^[1] Collectively, members of the
   House and Senate typically propose around 200 amendments during each
   two–year term of Congress.^[2] Most however, never get out of the
   Congressional committees in which they were proposed, and only a
   fraction of those that do receive enough support to win Congressional
   approval to actually go through the constitutional ratification
   process.

   The framers of the Constitution, recognizing the difference between
   regular legislation and constitutional matters, intended that it be
   difficult to change the Constitution; but not so difficult as to render
   it an inflexible instrument of government. The amending process they
   devised, codified in Article Five of the United States Constitution,
   has two steps. Proposals to amend the Constitution must be properly
   Adopted and Ratified before becoming operative.

          A proposed amendment may be adopted and sent to the states for
          ratification by either:

          + The United States Congress, whenever a two-thirds majority in
            both the Senate and the House of Representatives deem it
            necessary;

                OR

          + A national convention, called by Congress for this purpose, on
            the application of the legislatures of two-thirds (presently
            34) of the states.

          To become part of the Constitution, an adopted amendment must be
          ratified by either (as determined by Congress):

          + The legislatures of three-fourths (presently 38) of the
            states, within the stipulated time period—if any;

                OR

          + State ratifying conventions in three-fourths (presently 38) of
            the states, within the stipulated time period—if any.

          Upon being properly ratified, an amendment becomes an operative
          addition to the Constitution.

   There is a proviso at the end of Article V shielding three clauses in
   the new frame of government from being amended. They are: Article I,
   Section 9, Clause 1, concerning the migration and importation of
   slaves; Article I, Section 9, Clause 4, concerning Congress' taxing
   power; and, Article I, Section 3, Clause 1, which provides for equal
   representation of the states in the Senate. These are the only
   textually entrenched provisions of the Constitution. The shield
   protecting the first two entrenched clauses was absolute but of limited
   duration; it was in force only until 1808. The shield protecting the
   third entrenched clause, though less absolute than that covering the
   others is practically permanent; it will be in force until there is
   unanimous agreement among the states favoring a change.

   Beginning in the early 20th century, Congress has usually, but not
   always, stipulated that an amendment must be ratified by the required
   number of states within seven years from the date of its submission to
   the states in order to become part of the Constitution. Congress'
   authority to set ratification deadline was affirmed by the United
   States Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939).
