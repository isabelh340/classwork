   Second-generation programming language (2GL) is a generational way to
   categorize assembly languages.^[1] The term was coined to provide a
   distinction from higher level third-generation programming languages
   (3GL) such as COBOL and earlier machine code languages.
   Second-generation programming languages have the following properties:
     * The code can be read and written by a programmer. To run on a
       computer it must be converted into a machine readable form, a
       process called assembly.
     * The language is specific to a particular processor family and
       environment.

   Second-generation languages are sometimes used in kernels and device
   drivers (though C is generally employed for this in modern kernels),
   but more often find use in extremely intensive processing such as
   games, video editing, graphic manipulation/rendering.

   One method for creating such code is by allowing a compiler to generate
   a machine-optimized assembly language version of a particular function.
   This code is then hand-tuned, gaining both the brute-force insight of
   the machine optimizing algorithm and the intuitive abilities of the
   human optimizer.
