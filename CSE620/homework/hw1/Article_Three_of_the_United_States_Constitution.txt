Section 1: Federal courts[edit]

   Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal
   courts, requires a supreme court, allows inferior courts, requires good
   behavior tenure for judges, and prohibits decreasing the salaries of
   judges.

     The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one
     supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from
     time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme
     and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior,
     and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a
     Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance
     in Office.

Number of courts[edit]

   Article III authorizes and sanctions the establishment of (only) one
   Supreme Court, but does not set the number of justices that must be
   appointed to it; though Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 refers to a
   Chief Justice (who shall preside over the impeachment trial of a
   President). The number of justices has been fixed by statute. At
   present there are nine justices, one chief justice and eight associate
   justices, on the Supreme Court.

   Proposals to divide the Supreme Court into the separate panels have
   been made, but all have failed. Since all such proposals have failed,
   the Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of such a
   division. However, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote, "the
   Constitution does not appear to authorize two or more Supreme Courts
   functioning in effect as separate courts."

   The Supreme Court is the only federal court that is explicitly mandated
   by the Constitution. During the Constitutional Convention, a proposal
   was made for the Supreme Court to be the only federal court, having
   both original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction. This proposal
   was rejected in favor of the provision that exists today. Under this
   provision, the Congress may create inferior courts under both Article
   III, Section 1, and Article I, Section 8. The Article III courts, which
   are also known as "constitutional courts", were first created by the
   Judiciary Act of 1789. Article I courts, which are also known as
   "legislative courts", consist of regulatory agencies, such as the
   United States Tax Court. Article III courts are the only ones with
   judicial power, and so decisions of regulatory agencies remain subject
   to review by Article III courts. However, cases not requiring "judicial
   determination" may come before Article I courts. In the case of
   Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. 59 U.S. 272 (1855),
   the Supreme Court ruled that cases involving "a suit at the common law,
   or in equity, or admiralty" inherently involve judicial determination
   and must come before Article III courts. Other cases, such as
   bankruptcy cases, have been held not to involve judicial determination,
   and may therefore go before Article I courts. Similarly, several courts
   in the District of Columbia, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction
   of the Congress, are Article I courts rather than Article III courts.
   This article was expressly extended to the United States District Court
   for the District of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress through Federal
   Law 89-571, 80 Stat. 764, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
   1966. This transformed the article IV United States territorial court
   in Puerto Rico, created in the year 1900, to an Article III federal
   judicial district court.

   The Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, frequently called the
   court-packing plan,^[1] was a legislative initiative to add more
   justices to the Supreme Court proposed by U.S. President Franklin
   Roosevelt shortly after his victory in the 1936 presidential election.
   Although the bill aimed generally to overhaul and modernize all of the
   federal court system, its central and most controversial provision
   would have granted the President power to appoint an additional Justice
   to the U.S. Supreme Court for every sitting member over the age of 70½,
   up to a maximum of six.

   The Constitution is silent when it comes to judges of courts which have
   been abolished. The Judiciary Act of 1801 increased the number of
   courts to permit the Federalist President John Adams to appoint a
   number of Federalist judges before Thomas Jefferson took office. When
   Jefferson became President, the Congress abolished several of these
   courts and made no provision for the judges of those courts. The power
   to abolish a court was next used in 1913, when the Congress abolished
   the Commerce Court. In that case, however, Congress transferred the
   judges of the Commerce Court to the Circuit Courts.

Tenure[edit]

   The Constitution provides that judges "shall hold their Offices during
   good Behavior." The term "good behavior" is interpreted to mean that
   judges may serve for the remainder of their lives, although they may
   resign or retire voluntarily. A judge may also be removed by
   impeachment and conviction by congressional vote (hence the term good
   behavior); this has occurred fourteen times. Three other judges, Mark
   W. Delahay,^[2] George W. English,^[3] and Samuel B. Kent,^[4] chose to
   resign rather than go through the impeachment process.

Salaries[edit]

   The compensation of judges may not be decreased, but may be increased,
   during their continuance in office.

Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury[edit]

   Section 2 delineates federal judicial power, and brings that power into
   execution by conferring original jurisdiction and also appellate
   jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court. Additionally, this section
   requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, except impeachment cases.

     The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity,
     arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and
     Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all
     Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to
     all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies
     to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies
     between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another
     State;—between Citizens of different States;—between Citizens of the
     same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and
     between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States,
     Citizens or Subjects.

     In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and
     Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme
     Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases
     before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate
     Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and
     under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.

     Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by
     Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said
     Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any
     State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress
     may by Law have directed.

Clause 1: Cases and controversies[edit]

   Main article: Case or Controversy Clause

   Clause 1 of Section 2 authorizes the federal courts to hear actual
   cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to
   cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing,
   mootness, or ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires
   the presence of adverse parties who have some interest genuinely at
   stake in the case. In Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911),
   the Supreme Court denied jurisdiction to cases brought under a statute
   permitting certain Native Americans to bring suit against the United
   States to determine the constitutionality of a law allocating tribal
   lands. Counsel for both sides were to be paid from the federal
   Treasury. The Supreme Court held that, though the United States was a
   defendant, the case in question was not an actual controversy; rather,
   the statute was merely devised to test the constitutionality of a
   certain type of legislation. Thus the Court's ruling would be nothing
   more than an advisory opinion; therefore, the court dismissed the suit
   for failing to present a "case or controversy."

Eleventh Amendment and state sovereign immunity[edit]

   Main articles: Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and
   Sovereign immunity in the United States

   In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793), the Supreme Court ruled that
   Article III, Section 2 abrogated the States’ sovereign immunity and
   authorized federal courts to hear disputes between private citizens and
   States. This decision was overturned by the Eleventh Amendment, which
   was passed by the Congress on March 4, 1794 1 Stat. 402 and ratified by
   the states on February 7, 1795. It prohibits the federal courts from
   hearing any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one
   of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or
   Subjects of any Foreign State.^[5]

Clause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction[edit]

   See also: Jurisdiction stripping

   Clause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has original
   jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls, and
   also in those controversies which are subject to federal judicial power
   because at least one state is a party; the Court has held that the
   latter requirement is met if the United States has a controversy with a
   state.^[6]^[7] In other cases, the Supreme Court has only appellate
   jurisdiction, which may be regulated by the Congress. The Congress may
   not, however, amend the Court's original jurisdiction, as was found in
   Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (Cranch 1) 137 (1803) (the same decision
   which established the principle of judicial review). Marbury held that
   Congress can neither expand nor restrict the original jurisdiction of
   the Supreme Court. However, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is
   different. The Court's appellate jurisdiction is given "with such
   exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make."

   Often a court will assert a modest degree of power over a case for
   purposes of determining whether it has jurisdiction, and so the word
   "power" is not necessarily synonymous with the word
   "jurisdiction".^[8]^[9]

Judicial review[edit]

   Main articles: Judicial review and Judicial review in the United States

   The power of the federal judiciary to review the constitutionality of a
   statute or treaty, or to review an administrative regulation for
   consistency with either a statute, a treaty, or the Constitution
   itself, is an implied power derived in part from Clause 2 of Section
   2.^[10]

   Though the Constitution does not expressly provide that the federal
   judiciary has the power of judicial review, many of the Constitution's
   Framers viewed such a power as an appropriate power for the federal
   judiciary to possess. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote,

     The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province
     of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by
     the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to
     ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act
     proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be
     an irreconcilable variance between two, that which has the superior
     obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in
     other words, the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute,
     the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.^[11]

   Secretary of State James Madison, who won Marbury v. Madison, but lost
   Judicial review.

   Others, however, disagreed, claiming that each branch could determine
   for itself the constitutionality of its actions.

   A continuation of the text of Federalist No. 78 by Hamilton [below]
   counterbalances the tone of "judicial supremacists" who demand that
   both Congress and the Executive are compelled by the Constitution to
   enforce all court decisions, including those that, in their eyes, or
   those of the People, violate fundamental American principles.

     Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the
     judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power
     of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the
     legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that
     of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be
     governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to
     regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by
     those which are not fundamental.^[11]

   Hamilton continues. . .

     It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a
     repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional
     intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case
     of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every
     adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the
     sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL
     instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the
     substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The
     observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to
     be no judges distinct from that body.^[11]

   Marbury v. Madison involved a highly partisan set of circumstances.
   Though Congressional elections were held in November 1800, the newly
   elected officers did not take power until March. The Federalist Party
   had lost the elections. In the words of President Thomas Jefferson, the
   Federalists "retired into the judiciary as a stronghold". In the four
   months following the elections, the outgoing Congress created several
   new judgeships, which were filled by President John Adams. In the
   last-minute rush, however, Federalist Secretary of State John Marshall
   had neglected to deliver 17 of the commissions to their respective
   appointees. When James Madison took office as Secretary of State,
   several commissions remained undelivered. Bringing their claims under
   the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appointees, including William Marbury,
   petitioned the Supreme Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus, which
   in English law had been used to force public officials to fulfill their
   ministerial duties. Here, Madison would be required to deliver the
   commissions.

   Marbury posed a difficult problem for the court, which was led by then
   by Chief Justice John Marshall, the same person who had neglected to
   deliver the commissions when he was the Secretary of State. If
   Marshall's court commanded James Madison to deliver the commissions,
   Madison might ignore the order, thereby indicating the weakness of the
   court. Similarly, if the court denied William Marbury's request, the
   court would be seen as weak. Marshall held that appointee Marbury was
   indeed entitled to his commission. However, Justice Marshall contended
   that the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, since it purported
   to grant original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in cases not
   involving the States or ambassadors. The ruling thereby established
   that the federal courts could exercise judicial review over the actions
   of Congress or the executive branch.

   However, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 78, expressed the view
   that the Courts hold only the power of words, and not the power of
   compulsion upon those other two branches of government, upon which the
   Supreme Court is itself dependent. Then in 1820, Thomas Jefferson
   expressed his deep reservations about the doctrine of judicial review:

     You seem ... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all
     constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one
     which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges
     are as honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others,
     the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their
     corps.... Their power [is] the more dangerous as they are in office
     for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to
     the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single
     tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the
     corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It
     has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign
     within themselves.^[12]

Clause 3: Federal trials[edit]

   A nineteenth century painting of a jury.

   Clause 3 of Section 2 provides that Federal crimes, except impeachment
   cases, must be tried before a jury, unless the defendant waives his
   right. Also, the trial must be held in the state where the crime was
   committed. If the crime was not committed in any particular state, then
   the trial is held in such a place as set forth by the Congress. The
   United States Senate has the sole power to try impeachment cases.^[13]

   Two of the Constitutional Amendments that comprise the Bill of Rights
   contain related provisions. The Sixth Amendment enumerates the rights
   of individuals when facing criminal prosecution and the Seventh
   Amendment establishes an individual's right to a jury trial in certain
   civil cases. It also inhibits courts from overturning a jury's findings
   of fact. The Supreme Court has extended the protections of these
   amendments to individuals facing trial in state courts through the Due
   Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Section 3: Treason[edit]

   Iva Toguri, known as Tokyo Rose, and Tomoya Kawakita were two Japanese
   Americans who were tried for treason after World War II.

   Section 3 defines treason and its punishment.

     Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War
     against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and
     Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the
     Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession
     in open Court.

     The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason,
     but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or
     Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.

   The Constitution defines treason as specific acts, namely "levying War
   against [the people of the United States], or in adhering to their
   Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort." A contrast is therefore
   maintained with the English law, whereby a variety of crimes, including
   conspiring to kill the King, or "violating" the Queen, were punishable
   as treason. In Ex Parte Bollman, 8 U.S. 75 (1807), the Supreme Court
   ruled that "there must be an actual assembling of men, for the
   treasonable purpose, to constitute a levying of war."^[14]

   Under English law effective during the ratification of the U.S.
   Constitution, there were essentially five species of treason.^[citation
   needed] Of the five, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and
   adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving
   encompassing (or imagining) the death of the king, certain types of
   counterfeiting, and finally fornication with women in the royal family
   of the sort which could call into question the parentage of successors.
   James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was
   involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the
   Patriot cause.

   Section 3 also requires the testimony of two different witnesses on the
   same overt act, or a confession by the accused in open court, to
   convict for treason. This rule was derived from an older English
   statute, the Treason Act 1695.^[15]

   In Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), the Supreme Court ruled
   that "[e]very act, movement, deed, and word of the defendant charged to
   constitute treason must be supported by the testimony of two
   witnesses."^[16] In Haupt v. United States, 330 U.S. 631 (1947),
   however, the Supreme Court found that two witnesses are not required to
   prove intent, nor are two witnesses required to prove that an overt act
   is treasonable. The two witnesses, according to the decision, are
   required to prove only that the overt act occurred (eyewitnesses and
   federal agents investigating the crime, for example).

   Punishment for treason may not "work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture
   except during the Life of the Person" so convicted. The descendants of
   someone convicted for treason could not, as they were under English
   law, be considered "tainted" by the treason of their ancestor.
   Furthermore, Congress may confiscate the property of traitors, but that
   property must be inheritable at the death of the person convicted.

   In Federalist No. 43 James Madison wrote regarding the Treason Clause:

     As treason may be committed against the United States, the authority
     of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as
     new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by
     which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government,
     have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the
     convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this
     peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the
     crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and
     restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the
     consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author.

   Based on the above quotation, it was noted by the lawyer William J.
   Olson in an Amicus curiae in the case Hedges v. Obama that the Treason
   Clause was one of the enumerated powers of the federal government.^[17]
   He also stated that by defining treason in the U.S. Constitution and
   placing it in Article III "the founders intended the power to be
   checked by the judiciary, ruling out trials by military commissions. As
   James Madison noted, the Treason Clause also was designed to limit the
   power of the federal government to punish its citizens for “adhering to
   [the] enemies [of the United States by], giving them aid and
   comfort.”"^[17]
