   The Twenty-seventh Amendment (Amendment XXVII) prohibits any law that
   increases or decreases the salary of members of Congress from taking
   effect until the start of the next set of terms of office for
   Representatives. It is the most recent amendment to the United States
   Constitution. It was submitted by Congress to the states for
   ratification on September 25, 1789, and became part of the United
   States Constitution in May 1992, a record-setting period of 202 years,
   7 months and 12 days.^[1]

Text[edit]

     No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators
     and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of
     Representatives shall have intervened.^[2]

Background[edit]

   Several states raised the issue of Congressional salaries as they
   debated whether or not to ratify the 1787 Constitution. The North
   Carolina ratifying convention requested the following amendment, among
   others, be made to the Constitution:

     The laws ascertaining the compensation of senators and
     representatives, for their services, shall be postponed in their
     operation until after the election of representatives immediately
     succeeding the passing thereof; that excepted which shall first be
     passed on the subject.

   Virginia's ratifying convention recommended the identical amendment.
   New York's declaration of ratification was accompanied by a similar
   amendment request:

     That the Compensation for the Senators and Representatives be
     ascertained by standing law; and that no alteration of the existing
     rate of Compensation shall operate for the Benefit of the
     Representatives, until after a subsequent Election shall have been
     had.

Proposal and ratification[edit]

Proposal by Congress[edit]

   This amendment to the Constitution was introduced first in the House on
   June 8, 1789, by Representative James Madison of Virginia. One of a
   series of proposed Constitutional amendments, it was referred to a
   committee consisting of one representative from each State. After
   emerging from committee, the full House debated the issue and on August
   24, 1789 passed it and sixteen other articles of amendment. The
   proposals went next to the Senate, where 26 substantive alterations
   were made. On September 9, 1789, the Senate approved a culled and
   consolidated package of twelve articles of amendment.^[3] Nothing was
   changed in this amendment.

   On September 21, 1789, a House–Senate Conference Committee convened to
   resolve numerous differences between the House and Senate Bill of
   Rights proposals. On September 24, 1789, the committee issued its
   report, which finalized 12 Constitutional Amendments for House and
   Senate to consider. The House agreed to the Conference report that same
   day. The next day the Senate concurred.^[4]

Ratification by the states[edit]

     Ratified amendment, 1789–92
     Ratified amendment, 1873
     Ratified amendment, 1978–91
     Ratified amendment, May 1992^1
     Ratified amendment post-enactment, 1992–95
     Ratified amendment twice (NC: 1789/1989; KY: 1792/1996)
     Haven't ratified amendment
   ^1The Archivist did not certify the amendment until May 18, 1992, with
   40 states listed as ratifying the amendment. Kentucky's then-unknown
   1792 ratification would have made it 41 states that had ratified at the
   time of certification, 3 more than the 38 required for a three-quarters
   majority.

   Twelve constitutional amendments were sent to the states for their
   consideration on September 25, 1789. Ten of these proposals were
   ratified fifteen months later and are known collectively as the Bill of
   Rights. One, Article the First is still technically pending before the
   states.

   There is some conflict as to the exact ratification dates of the
   Twenty-seventh Amendment. In some cases, a state's ratification
   resolution was signed by legislative officers before that state's
   second house had acted. In other cases, several governors subsequently
   "approved" the resolutions, even though gubernatorial action is not
   required by Article V (which requires ratification only by state
   legislatures or state conventions). Many state legislative journals are
   unavailable.^[5]

   Under the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in Coleman v. Miller,
   307 U.S. 433 (1939), any proposed amendment which has been submitted to
   the states for ratification and does not specify a ratification
   deadline may be ratified by the states at any time. In Coleman, the
   Supreme Court further ruled that the ratification of a constitutional
   amendment is political in nature—and so not a matter properly assigned
   to the judiciary.

   The following states ratified this article, making it part of the
   Constitution:
    1. Maryland — December 19, 1789
    2. North Carolina — December 22, 1789; July 4, 1989^[6]
    3. South Carolina — January 19, 1790
    4. Delaware — January 28, 1790
    5. Vermont — November 3, 1791
    6. Virginia — December 15, 1791
    7. Kentucky — June 27, 1792; March 21, 1996
    8. Ohio — May 6, 1873 (as a means of protest against the 1873 "Salary
       Grab Act"^[7])
    9. Wyoming — March 6, 1978 (as a protest against a congressional pay
       raise^[8])
   10. Maine — April 27, 1983
   11. Colorado — April 22, 1984
   12. South Dakota — February 21, 1985
   13. New Hampshire — March 7, 1985 (After rejection – January 26,
       1790^[9])
   14. Arizona — April 3, 1985
   15. Tennessee — May 28, 1985
   16. Oklahoma — July 1, 1985
   17. New Mexico — February 14, 1986
   18. Indiana — February 24, 1986
   19. Utah — February 25, 1986
   20. Arkansas — March 13, 1987
   21. Montana — March 17, 1987
   22. Connecticut — May 13, 1987
   23. Wisconsin — July 15, 1987
   24. Georgia — February 2, 1988
   25. West Virginia — March 10, 1988
   26. Louisiana — July 7, 1988
   27. Iowa — February 9, 1989
   28. Idaho — March 23, 1989
   29. Nevada — April 26, 1989
   30. Alaska — May 6, 1989
   31. Oregon — May 19, 1989
   32. Minnesota — May 22, 1989
   33. Texas — May 25, 1989
   34. Kansas — April 5, 1990
   35. Florida — May 31, 1990
   36. North Dakota — March 25, 1991
   37. Alabama — May 5, 1992
   38. Missouri — May 5, 1992
   39. Michigan — May 7, 1992
       On May 18, 1992, the Archivist of the United States, Don W. Wilson,
       certified that the amendment's ratification was completed on May 7,
       1992, with Michigan being the 38th state to ratify.^[10] The
       certification was officially proclaimed the next day in the Federal
       Register.^[11] It later came to light that the Kentucky General
       Assembly had ratified all 12 amendments during that state's initial
       month of statehood,^[12] technically making Missouri the 38th state
       to ratify the amendment and finalize its addition to the
       Constitution.^[13] Nonetheless, the federal government's official
       record still holds that Michigan was the 38th state to ratify the
       amendment.^[5]^[10]^[14]

   The Twenty-seventh Amendment was also ratified by:

          40. New Jersey — May 7, 1992 (After rejection – November 20,
          1789^[9])
          41. Illinois — May 12, 1992
          42. California — June 26, 1992
          43. Rhode Island — June 10, 1993^[15] (After rejection – June 7,
          1790^[9])
          44. Hawaii — April 29, 1994^[15]
          45. Washington — April 6, 1995^[15]

   Five states have not ratified the Twenty-seventh Amendment:
   Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Revival of Interest[edit]

   This proposed amendment was largely forgotten before University of
   Texas at Austin undergraduate student Gregory Watson wrote a paper on
   the subject in 1982.^[16] Despite receiving a 'C' grade on his paper by
   an instructor who deemed his idea 'unrealistic',^[17]^[18] Watson
   started a new push for ratification with a letter-writing campaign to
   state legislatures.^[7]

   At the time Watson commenced his campaign in early 1982, he was aware
   of ratifications by only six states and he erroneously believed that
   Virginia's 1791 approval was the last action taken within the states.
   He learned in July 1983 that Ohio had approved it in 1873 and he
   learned in November 1984 that Wyoming did the same thing in 1978.
   Further, he did not know until 1997, some five years after ratification
   was completed, that Kentucky offered its ratification of the amendment
   in 1792. The first legislature to ratify as a result of Watson's
   campaign was Maine in April 1983, followed by Colorado in April 1984.
   Numerous state legislatures followed suit, and the ratification by
   Michigan on May 7, 1992 provided the 38th state ratification
   (Kentucky's 1792 ratification having been missed) required for the
   archivist to certify the amendment.

Affirmation of ratification[edit]

   In certifying that the amendment had been duly ratified, the Archivist
   of the United States had acted under statutory authority granted to his
   office by the Congress under Title 1, section 106b of the United States
   Code, which states:

     Whenever official notice is received at the National Archives and
     Records Administration that any amendment proposed to the
     Constitution of the United States has been adopted, according to the
     provisions of the Constitution, the Archivist of the United States
     shall forthwith cause the amendment to be published, with his
     certificate, specifying the States by which the same may have been
     adopted, and that the same has become valid, to all intents and
     purposes, as a part of the Constitution of the United States.

   The response in Congress was sharp. Senator Robert Byrd of West
   Virginia scolded Wilson for certifying the amendment as ratified
   without congressional approval. Although Byrd supported Congressional
   acceptance of the amendment, he contended that Wilson had deviated from
   "historic tradition" by not waiting for Congress to consider the
   validity of the ratification, given the extremely long lapse of time
   since the Amendment had been proposed.^[11] Speaker of the House Tom
   Foley and others called for a legal challenge to the amendment's
   unusual ratification.

   On May 20, 1992, under the authority recognized in Coleman, and in
   keeping with the precedent first established regarding the ratification
   of the Fourteenth Amendment, each house of the 102nd Congress passed
   its own version of a concurrent resolution agreeing that the amendment
   was validly ratified, despite the unorthodox period of more than 202
   years for the completion of the task.

Cost of living adjustments[edit]

   Congressional cost of living adjustments (COLA) have been upheld
   against legal challenges based on this amendment. In Boehner v.
   Anderson,^[19] the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
   Columbia Circuit ruled that the Twenty-seventh Amendment does not
   affect annual COLAs. In Schaffer v. Clinton,^[20] the United States
   Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that receiving such a COLA
   does not grant members of the Congress standing in federal court to
   challenge that COLA; the Supreme Court did not hear either case and so
   has never ruled on this amendment's effect on COLAs.
