                     (January 2011)

Press[edit]

   Main article: Newspapers in the United States
   The logo for The New York Times, an American newspaper.

   Newspapers declined in their influence and penetration into American
   households in the late 20th century. Most newspapers are local, having
   little circulation outside their particular metropolitan area. The
   closest thing to a national paper the U.S. has is USA Today. Other
   influential dailies include the New York Times, the Washington Post and
   the Wall Street Journal which are sold in most U.S. cities.

   The largest newspapers (by circulation) in the United States are USA
   Today, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Los Angeles
   Times.

Mail[edit]

   The legal monopoly of the government-owned United States Postal Service
   has narrowed during the 20th and 21st centuries due to competition from
   companies such as UPS & FedEx, although still delivers the vast
   majority of US mail.

Telephone[edit]

   Telephone system:
   General assessment: A large, technologically advanced, multipurpose
   communications system.
   Domestic: A large system of fiber-optic cable, microwave radio relay,
   coaxial cable, and domestic satellites carries every form of telephone
   traffic; a rapidly growing cellular system carries mobile telephone
   traffic throughout the country.
   International: Country code - 1; 24 ocean cable systems in use;
   satellite earth stations - 61 Intelsat (45 Atlantic Ocean and 16
   Pacific Ocean), 5 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region), and 4 Inmarsat
   (Pacific and Atlantic Ocean regions) (2000).

Landlines[edit]

   Telephones - main lines in use: 141 million (2009)^[1]
     * Most of the American telephone system was formerly operated by a
       single monopoly, AT&T, which was split up in 1984 into a long
       distance telephone company and seven regional "Baby Bells."
     * Landline telephone service continues to be divided between
       incumbent local exchange carriers and several competing long
       distance companies. As of 2005, some of the Baby Bells are
       beginning to merge with long distance phone companies. A small
       number of consumers are currently experimenting with Voice over
       Internet Protocol phone service.
     * Most local loop service to homes is provided through old-fashioned
       copper wire, although many of the Baby Bells are beginning to
       upgrade the so-called "last mile" to fiber optic.
     * Early in the 21st century the number of wire lines in use stopped
       growing and in some markets began to decline.^[2]

Cellular/Wireless communication[edit]

   Main article: Mobile phone industry in the United States

   Telephones - mobile cellular: 286 million (2009)^[1]
     * Most states have several competing cellular phone networks.
     * The major cellphone companies in the U.S. are Verizon Wireless,
       AT&T Mobility, Sprint Corporation, and T-Mobile US.

Radio[edit]

   Main article: Radio in the United States

   Radio broadcast stations: AM: 4,789; FM commercial stations: 6,231; FM
   educational stations: 2,672; FM translators & boosters: 3,995;
   low-power FM stations: 675 (as of December 31, 2005, according to the
   Federal Communications Commission)
     * Most broadcast stations are controlled by large media conglomerates
       like Clear Channel Communications. There are also many small
       independent local stations. National Public Radio (NPR) is the
       public radio network.

   Radios: 575 million (1997)

Television[edit]

   Main article: Television in the United States

   Television broadcast stations: 9,024 (of which 1,750 are full-power TV
   stations; 592 are class-A TV stations; 4,537 are TV translators; and
   2,145 are other low-power TV stations) (as of December 31, 2005,
   according to the Federal Communications Commission); in addition, there
   are about 12,000 cable TV systems.
     * Most local commercial television stations are owned-and-operated by
       or affiliated with the large national broadcast networks such as
       ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and The CW. Some television networks are aimed
       at ethnic minorities, including Spanish-language networks Univisión
       and Telemundo. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), is the public
       broadcasting network, with over 300 non-profit affiliated stations
       across the United States. Besides the large broadcast networks
       (which are free for anyone with a TV and an antenna), there are
       also many networks available only with a subscription to cable or
       satellite television, like CNN.

   Televisions: 219 million (1997)

   of United States cable and satellite television networks

Internet[edit]

   Main article: Internet in the United States

   Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 7,600 (1999 est.)
     * Because of aggressive lobbying and the United States' strong
       libertarian traditions, the Internet service provider industry
       remains relatively unregulated in comparison to other
       communications industries.

   Country code (Top level domain): US
     * For various historical reasons, the .us domain was never widely
       used outside of a small number of government agencies and school
       districts. Most companies signed up for top level domains like .com
       instead.
     * NeuStar Inc. now has control over the .us registry and is trying to
       promote the domain as an option for American-oriented Web sites.
