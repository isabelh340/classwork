   The President of the United States of America (POTUS)^[7] is the head
   of state and head of government of the United States. The president
   leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the
   commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The person in
   this position is the leader of the country which has the largest
   economy and the largest military, with command authority over the
   largest active nuclear arsenal. The president is frequently described
   as the most powerful person in the world.^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]

   Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the
   United States in the president and charges him with the execution of
   federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal
   executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers, and
   concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of
   the Senate. The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons
   and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of
   Congress under extraordinary circumstances.^[13] Since the founding of
   the United States, the power of the president and the federal
   government have grown substantially,^[14] and each modern president,
   despite possessing no formal legislative powers beyond signing or
   vetoing congressionally passed bills, is largely responsible for
   dictating the legislative agenda of his party and the foreign and
   domestic policy of the United States.^[15]

   The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral
   College to a four-year term, and is one of only two nationally elected
   federal officers, the other being the Vice President of the United
   States.^[16] The Twenty-second Amendment, adopted in 1951, prohibits
   anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term.
   It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more
   than once if that person previously had served as president, or acting
   president, for more than two years of another person's term as
   president. In all, 43 individuals have served 44 presidencies
   (Cleveland's two non-consecutive terms each counted) spanning 56 full
   four-year terms.^[17] On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the 44th
   and current president. On November 6, 2012, he was re-elected and is
   currently serving the 57th term, which ends on January 20, 2017.

   In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies, acting through the Second Continental
   Congress, declared political independence from Great Britain during the
   American Revolution. The new states, though independent of each other
   as nation states,^[18] recognized the necessity of closely coordinating
   their efforts against the British.^[19] Desiring to avoid anything that
   remotely resembled a monarchy, Congress negotiated the Articles of
   Confederation to establish a weak alliance between the states.^[18] As
   a central authority, Congress under the Articles was without any
   legislative power; it could make its own resolutions, determinations,
   and regulations, but not any laws, nor any taxes or local commercial
   regulations enforceable upon citizens.^[19] This institutional design
   reflected the conception of how Americans believed the deposed British
   system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to
   the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned
   the entire empire.^[19] Out from under any monarchy, the states
   assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving
   ambassadors, etc.) to Congress, while severally lodging the rest within
   their own respective state governments. Only after all the states
   agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the
   Articles take effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the final
   state to ratify them.

   In 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the
   former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward
   their own internal affairs.^[18] By 1786, Americans found their
   continental borders besieged and weak, their respective economies in
   crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another,
   witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for
   imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African
   pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and
   accruing interest.^[18] Civil and political unrest loomed.

   Following the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes
   between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785,
   Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for
   September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving
   further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention
   failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other
   states, the Annapolis delegates called for a convention to offer
   revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia.
   Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison
   and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's
   attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.^[18]^[20]

   When the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state
   delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought
   with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional
   arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within
   their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak
   executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the
   legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive
   council, and countered by a strong legislature.^[18] New York offered
   the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and
   appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for
   reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.^[18] It was
   through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the
   presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged.

Powers and duties

Article I legislative role

   Obama signing legislation at the Resolute desk

   The first power the Constitution confers upon the president is the
   veto. The Presentment Clause requires any bill passed by Congress to be
   presented to the president before it can become law. Once the
   legislation has been presented, the president has three options:
    1. Sign the legislation; the bill then becomes law.
    2. Veto the legislation and return it to Congress, expressing any
       objections; the bill does not become law, unless each house of
       Congress votes to override the veto by a two-thirds vote.
    3. Take no action. In this instance, the president neither signs nor
       vetoes the legislation. After 10 days, not counting Sundays, two
       possible outcomes emerge:
          + If Congress is still convened, the bill becomes law.
          + If Congress has adjourned, thus preventing the return of the
            legislation, the bill does not become law. This latter outcome
            is known as the pocket veto.

   In 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with
   the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign
   any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain
   spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any
   amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Once
   a president had stricken the item, Congress could pass that particular
   item again. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress
   could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in
   both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the
   U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto
   power to be unconstitutional.

Article II executive powers

War and foreign affairs powers

   Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, successfully
   preserved the Union during the American Civil War

   Perhaps the most important of all presidential powers is command of the
   United States Armed Forces as its commander-in-chief. While the power
   to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, the president
   has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the
   military. The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces
   (belonging to the Department of Defense) is normally exercised through
   the Secretary of Defense, with assistance of the Chairman of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff, to the Combatant Commands, as outlined in the
   presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).^[21]^[22]^[23] The
   framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers
   regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explains this in Federalist
   No. 69:

     The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of
     the United States. ... It would amount to nothing more than the
     supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces ...
     while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING
     of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all
     [of] which ... would appertain to the legislature.^[24] [Emphasis in
     the original.]

   Congress, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, must authorize any
   troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on
   triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it
   ineffectual.^[25] Additionally, Congress provides a check to
   presidential military power through its control over military spending
   and regulation. While historically presidents initiated the process for
   going to war,^[26]^[27] critics have charged that there have been
   several conflicts in which presidents did not get official
   declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama
   in 1903,^[26] the Korean War,^[26] the Vietnam War,^[26] and the
   invasions of Grenada in 1983^[28] and Panama in 1990.^[29]

   Along with the armed forces, the president also directs U.S. foreign
   policy. Through the Department of State and the Department of Defense,
   the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and
   of foreign nationals in the United States. The president decides
   whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiates
   treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States
   when approved by two-thirds vote of the Senate.^[citation needed]

   Although not constitutionally provided, presidents also sometimes
   employ "executive agreements" in foreign relations. These agreements
   frequently regard administrative policy choices germane to executive
   power; for example, the extent to which either country presents an
   armed presence in a given area, how each country will enforce copyright
   treaties, or how each country will process foreign mail. However, the
   20th century witnessed a vast expansion of the use of executive
   agreements, and critics have challenged the extent of that use as
   supplanting the treaty process and removing constitutionally prescribed
   checks and balances over the executive in foreign relations. Supporters
   counter that the agreements offer a pragmatic solution when the need
   for swift, secret, and/or concerted action arises.^[citation needed]

Administrative powers

   Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the
   executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him
   as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.
   William Rehnquist, Nixon v. General Services Administration, 433 U.S.
   425 (1977) (dissenting opinion)

   The president is the head of the executive branch of the federal
   government and is constitutionally obligated to "take care that the
   laws be faithfully executed."^[30] The executive branch has over four
   million employees, including members of the military.^[31]

   Presidents make numerous executive branch appointments: an incoming
   president may make up to 6,000 before he takes office and 8,000 more
   during his term. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and other federal
   officers, are all appointed by a president with the "advice and
   consent" of a majority of the Senate. When the Senate is in recess for
   at least ten days, the president may make recess appointments.^[32]
   Recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next
   session of the Senate.

   The power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a
   contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove purely
   executive officials at his discretion.^[33] However, Congress can
   curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of
   independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers
   by statute.^[34]

   The president additionally possesses the ability to direct much of the
   executive branch through executive orders that are grounded in federal
   law or constitutionally granted executive power. Executive orders are
   reviewable by federal courts and can be superseded by federal
   legislation.

   To manage the growing federal bureaucracy, Presidents have gradually
   surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually
   organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United
   States. Within the Executive Office, the President's innermost layer of
   aides (and their assistants) are located in the White House Office.

Juridical powers

   The president also has the power to nominate federal judges, including
   members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of
   the United States. However, these nominations do require Senate
   confirmation. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for
   presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular
   ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts,
   presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of Senatorial
   courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves, as is often
   done just before the end of a presidential term, not without
   controversy.^[35]^[36]^[37]

   Historically, two doctrines concerning executive power have developed
   that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of
   autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president
   to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the
   president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington
   first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice
   John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great
   Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law,
   Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When
   Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not
   turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate
   scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.
   683 (1974), that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a
   president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President
   Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the
   Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S.
   681 (1997), that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits.
   These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is
   valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly
   defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to
   radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have
   weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that
   do not involve the president.^[38]
   President George W. Bush delivering the 2007 State of the Union
   Address, with Vice President Dick Cheney and Speaker of the House Nancy
   Pelosi behind him

   The state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive
   branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal
   proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for
   the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson
   refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron
   Burr and again in Totten v. United States 92 U.S. 105 (1876), when the
   Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.^[39]
   However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme
   Court until United States v. Reynolds 345 U.S. 1 (1953), where it was
   held to be a common law evidentiary privilege.^[40] Before the
   September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but
   increasing in frequency.^[41] Since 2001, the government has asserted
   the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation,
   thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching
   the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Mohamed
   v. Jeppesen Dataplan.^[40]^[42]^[43] Critics of the privilege claim its
   use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or
   embarrassing government actions.^[44]^[45]

Legislative facilitator

   The Constitution's Ineligibility Clause prevents the President (and all
   other executive officers) from simultaneously being a member of
   Congress. Therefore, the president cannot directly introduce
   legislative proposals for consideration in Congress. However, the
   president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially
   if the president's political party has a majority in one or both houses
   of Congress. For example, the president or other officials of the
   executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or
   representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president
   can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally
   mandated, periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either
   written or oral, but today are given as the State of the Union address,
   which often outlines the president's legislative proposals for the
   coming year.

   In the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative
   and budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should
   belong to Congress. As the head of the executive branch, presidents
   control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little
   oversight from Congress. One critic charged that presidents could
   appoint a "virtual army of 'czars' – each wholly unaccountable to
   Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the
   White House."^[46] Presidents have been criticized for making signing
   statements when signing congressional legislation about how they
   understand a bill or plan to execute it.^[47] This practice has been
   criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.^[48]
   Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an "increasingly swollen
   executive branch" and "the eclipse of Congress."^[49]

   According to Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution, the
   president may convene either or both houses of Congress. If both houses
   cannot agree on a date of adjournment, the president may appoint a date
   for Congress to adjourn.

Ceremonial roles

   Opening Day, 1916

   As head of state, the president can fulfill traditions established by
   previous presidents. William Howard Taft started the tradition of
   throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium,
   Washington, D.C., on the Washington Senators' Opening Day. Every
   president since Taft, except for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one
   ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or
   the World Series, usually with much fanfare.^[50]

   Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays.
   Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for
   local children.^[51] Beginning in 1947 during the Harry S. Truman
   administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a
   live domestic turkey during the annual national thanksgiving turkey
   presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of
   "pardoning" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey
   has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural
   life.^[52]

   Presidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of
   government. Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally
   give advice to their successor during the presidential transition.^[53]
   Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on
   the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming
   president.^[54]

   During a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president
   typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a
   custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.^[55] This is followed by a
   state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining
   Room later in the evening.^[56]

   The modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's
   premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a
   tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials
   as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the
   presidency as "propagandized leadership" which has a "mesmerizing power
   surrounding the office."^[57] Administration public relations managers
   staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling
   crowds for television cameras.^[58] One critic wrote the image of John
   F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed "in rich detail" which
   "drew on the power of myth" regarding the incident of PT 109^[59] and
   wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his
   presidential ambitions.^[60] As a result, some political commentators
   have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of
   presidents: voters expect a president to "drive the economy, vanquish
   enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the
   national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees."^[61]

Critics of presidency's evolution

   Main article: Imperial Presidency

   Most of the nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was
   the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the
   dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong
   executive.^[62] However, presidential power has shifted over time,
   which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too
   powerful,^[63]^[64] unchecked, unbalanced,^[65] and "monarchist" in
   nature.^[66] Critic Dana D. Nelson believes presidents over the past
   thirty years have worked towards "undivided presidential control of the
   executive branch and its agencies."^[67] She criticizes proponents of
   the unitary executive for expanding "the many existing uncheckable
   executive powers – such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums,
   proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing
   statements – that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of
   foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from
   Congress."^[67] Activist Bill Wilson opined that the expanded
   presidency was "the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and
   democratic rule."^[68]

Selection process

   George Washington, the first President of the United States

Eligibility

   Main article: Age of candidacy

   Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets the
   requirements to hold office. A president must:
     * be a natural-born citizen of the United States;^[note 1]
     * be at least thirty-five years old;
     * have been a permanent resident in the United States for at least
       fourteen years.

   A person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from
   holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:
     * Under the Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected
       president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any
       eligible person who serves as president or acting president for
       more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person
       was elected president, the former can only be elected president
       once. Scholars disagree whether anyone no longer eligible to be
       elected president could be elected vice president, pursuant to the
       qualifications set out under the Twelfth Amendment.^[69]
     * Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, upon conviction in
       impeachment cases, the Senate has the option of disqualifying
       convicted individuals from holding other federal offices, including
       the presidency.^[70]
     * Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an
       oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the
       United States, can become president. However, this disqualification
       can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.

Campaigns and nomination

   Main articles: United States presidential primary, United States
   presidential nominating convention, United States presidential election
   debates and United States presidential election

   The modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections,
   which the two major political parties use to clear the field of
   candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most
   successful candidate is made the party's nominee for president.
   Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice
   presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the
   convention.

   Nominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the
   debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican
   nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in
   the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their
   views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern
   electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through
   frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.

Election and oath

   Main articles: Electoral College (United States) and Oath of office of
   the President of the United States
   A map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes
   allocated to each state following reapportionment based on the 2010
   census; 270 electoral votes are required for a majority out of 538
   overall

   The president is elected indirectly. A number of electors, collectively
   known as the Electoral College, officially select the president. On
   Election Day, voters in each of the states and the District of Columbia
   cast ballots for these electors. Each state is allocated a number of
   electors, equal to the size of its delegation in both Houses of
   Congress combined. Generally, the ticket that wins the most votes in a
   state wins all of that state's electoral votes and thus has its slate
   of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College.

   The winning slate of electors meet at its state's capital on the first
   Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after
   the election, to vote. They then send a record of that vote to
   Congress. The vote of the electors is opened by the sitting vice
   president—acting in his capacity as President of the Senate—and read
   aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress, which was elected at
   the same time as the president.

   Pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the president's term of office
   begins at noon on January 20 of the year following the election. This
   date, known as Inauguration Day, marks the beginning of the four-year
   terms of both the president and the vice president. Before executing
   the powers of the office, a president is constitutionally required to
   take the presidential oath:

     I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the
     Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my
     Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
     States.^[71]

   Although not required, presidents have traditionally palmed a Bible
   while swearing the oath and have added, "So help me God!" to the end of
   the oath.^[72] Further, although the oath may be administered by any
   person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are
   traditionally sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States.

Tenure and term limits

   Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four terms before the adoption of
   the Twenty-second Amendment

   The term of office for president and vice president is four years.
   George Washington, the first president, set an unofficial precedent of
   serving only two terms, which subsequent presidents followed until
   1940. Before Franklin D. Roosevelt, attempts at a third term were
   encouraged by supporters of Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt;
   neither of these attempts succeeded. In 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt
   declined to seek a third term, but allowed his political party to
   "draft" him as its presidential candidate and was subsequently elected
   to a third term. In 1941, the United States entered World War II,
   leading voters to elect Roosevelt to a fourth term in 1944.

   After the war, and in response to Roosevelt being elected to third and
   fourth terms, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted. The amendment
   bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if
   that person served more than half of another president's term. Harry S.
   Truman, who was president when the amendment was adopted, and so by the
   amendment's provisions exempt from its limitation, also briefly sought
   a third (a second full) term before withdrawing from the 1952 election.

   Since the amendment's adoption, four presidents have served two full
   terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W.
   Bush. Barack Obama has been elected to a second term. Jimmy Carter and
   George H. W. Bush sought a second term, but were defeated. Richard
   Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it.
   Lyndon B. Johnson was the only president under the amendment to be
   eligible to serve more than two terms in total, having served for only
   fourteen months following John F. Kennedy's assassination. However,
   Johnson withdrew from the 1968 Democratic Primary, surprising many
   Americans. Gerald Ford sought a full term, after serving out the last
   two years and five months of Nixon's second term, but was not elected.

Vacancy or disability

   See also: Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
   United States presidential line of succession, Presidential Succession
   Act and Impeachment in the United States

   Vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible
   circumstances: death, resignation and removal from office.

   Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows the House of
   Representatives to impeach high federal officials, including the
   president, for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
   misdemeanors." Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 gives the Senate the
   power to remove impeached officials from office, given a two-thirds
   vote to convict. The House has thus far impeached two presidents:
   Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was
   subsequently convicted by the Senate; however, Johnson was acquitted by
   just one vote.

   Under Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may
   transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who
   then becomes acting president, by transmitting a statement to the
   Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate
   stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the
   discharge of the presidential powers and duties when he transmits, to
   those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption.
   This transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers
   appropriate; in 2002 and again in 2007, President George W. Bush
   briefly transferred presidential authority to Vice President Dick
   Cheney. In both cases, this was done to accommodate a medical procedure
   which required Bush to be sedated; both times, Bush returned to duty
   later the same day.^[73]

   Under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the vice president, in
   conjunction with a majority of the Cabinet, may transfer the
   presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president
   by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and
   the president pro tempore of the Senate that the president is unable to
   discharge the presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the
   vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting
   president; however, the president can declare that no such inability
   exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties.
   If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to
   Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to
   decide the merit of the claim.

   The United States Constitution mentions the resignation of the
   president but does not regulate the form of such a resignation or the
   conditions for its validity. Pursuant to federal law, the only valid
   evidence of the president's resignation is a written instrument to that
   effect, signed by the president and delivered to the office of the
   Secretary of State.^[74] This has only occurred once, when Richard
   Nixon delivered a letter to Henry Kissinger to that effect.

   The Constitution states that the vice president becomes president upon
   the removal from office, death or resignation of the preceding
   president. If the offices of president and vice president both are
   either vacant or have a disabled holder of that office, the next
   officer in the presidential line of succession, the Speaker of the
   House, becomes acting president. The line then extends to the president
   pro tempore of the Senate, followed by every member of the Cabinet in a
   set order. Special elections are never held for the office of
   president.

   Sources:^[75]^[76]^[77]

   Since 2001, the president has earned a $400,000 annual salary, along
   with a $50,000 annual expense account, a $100,000 nontaxable travel
   account, and $19,000 for entertainment.^[78]^[79] The most recent raise
   in salary was approved by Congress and President Bill Clinton in 1999
   and went into effect in 2001.

   The White House in Washington, D.C., serves as the official place of
   residence for the president; he is entitled to use its staff and
   facilities, including medical care, recreation, housekeeping, and
   security services. The government pays for state dinners and other
   official functions, but the president pays for dry cleaning and food
   that he, his family, and personal guests consume; the high food bill
   often amazes new residents.^[80] Naval Support Facility Thurmont,
   popularly known as Camp David, is a mountain-based military camp in
   Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high
   alert protection of the president and his guests. Blair House, located
   next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House
   Complex and Lafayette Park, is a complex of four connected townhouses
   exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500 m^2) of floor space which serves as
   the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for
   the president if needed.^[81]

   For ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which
   is an armored limousine built on a heavily modified Cadillac-based
   chassis.^[82] One of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are
   extensively modified versions of Boeing 747-200B airliners, serve as
   long distance travel for the president and are referred to as Air Force
   One while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force
   aircraft the President is aboard is designated as "Air Force One" for
   the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled
   with just one of the two planes while overseas trips are handled with
   both, one primary and one backup. Any civilian aircraft the President
   is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.^[83]^[84] The
   president also has a fleet of thirty-five U.S. Marine Corps helicopters
   at his disposal of varying models, designated Marine One when the
   president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are
   typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together
   and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the
   President is actually aboard to any would-be threats.

   The U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the sitting
   president and the first family. As part of their protection,
   presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family
   members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret
   Service codenames.^[85] The use of such names was originally for
   security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic
   communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply
   serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.^[86]

Post-presidency

   Carter, with President-elect Barack Obama in the Oval Office on January
   7, 2009.

   Beginning in 1959, all living former presidents were granted a pension,
   an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times with
   Congressional approval. Retired presidents now receive a pension based
   on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries,
   which was $199,700 each year in 2012.^[87] Former presidents who served
   in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.^[88] The Former
   Presidents Act, as amended, also provides former presidents with travel
   funds and franking privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents,
   their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the
   Secret Service until the president's death.^[89]^[90] In 1997, Congress
   passed legislation limiting secret service protection to no more than
   10 years from the date a president leaves office.^[91] On January 10,
   2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime secret
   service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent
   presidents.^[92] A spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for
   secret service protection.^[91]

   Some presidents have had significant careers after leaving office.
   Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as Chief
   Justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government
   reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for
   reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later
   in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the
   White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of
   Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and Andrew Johnson
   returned to the Senate in 1875. John Tyler served in the provisional
   Congress of the Confederate States during the Civil War and was elected
   to the Confederate House of Representatives, but died before that body
   first met.

   Presidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private
   messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United
   States to state funerals and other important foreign events.^[93]^[94]
   Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China
   and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.^[95] Jimmy Carter has
   become a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and
   election monitor, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill
   Clinton has also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the
   negotiations that led to the release of two American journalists, Laura
   Ling and Euna Lee, from North Korea. Clinton has also been active
   politically since his presidential term ended, working with his wife
   Hillary on her presidential bid and President Obama on his reelection
   campaign.

Presidential libraries

   Main article: Presidential library

   Since Herbert Hoover, each president has created a repository known as
   a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers,
   records and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are
   deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records
   Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping
   each library must come from private, non-federal sources.^[96] There
   are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There
   are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and
   private foundations, such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library
   and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois.

   As many presidents live for many years after leaving office, several of
   them have personally overseen the building and opening of their own
   presidential libraries, some even making arrangements for their own
   burial at the site. Several presidential libraries therefore contain
   the graves of the president they document, such as the Richard Nixon
   Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California and the
   Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. The
   graves are viewable by the general public visiting these libraries.

       in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there
       were four reported cases in which the government invoked the
       privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one
       reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the
