   The United States Electoral College is the institution that officially
   elects the President and Vice President of the United States every four
   years. The President and Vice President are not elected directly by the
   voters. Instead, they are elected by "electors" who are chosen by
   popular vote on a state-by-state basis.^[3] Electors are apportioned to
   each state and the District of Columbia, but not to territorial
   possessions of the United States, such as Puerto Rico and Guam. *The
   number of electors in each state is equal to the number of members of
   Congress to which the state is entitled,^[4] while the Twenty-third
   Amendment grants the District of Columbia the same number of electors
   as the least populous state, currently three. In total, there are 538
   electors, corresponding to the 435 members of the House of
   Representatives, 100 senators, and the three additional electors from
   the District of Columbia.

   Electors are almost always pledged to particular presidential and vice
   presidential candidates, though unpledged electors are possible. Except
   for the electors in Maine and Nebraska, electors are elected on a
   "winner-take-all" basis.^[5] That is, all electors pledged to the
   presidential candidate who wins the most votes in a state become
   electors for that state. Maine and Nebraska use the "congressional
   district method", selecting one elector within each congressional
   district by popular vote and selecting the remaining two electors by a
   statewide popular vote.^[6] Although no elector is required by federal
   law to honor a pledge, there have only been very few occasions when an
   elector voted contrary to a pledge.^[1]^[7] The Twelfth Amendment, in
   specifying how a President and Vice President are elected, requires
   each elector to cast one vote for President and another vote for Vice
   President.

   The candidate that receives an absolute majority of electoral votes
   (currently 270) for the office of President or of Vice President is
   elected to that office. The Twelfth Amendment provides for what happens
   if the Electoral College fails to elect a President or Vice President.
   If no candidate receives a majority for President, then the House of
   Representatives will select the President, with each state delegation
   (instead of each Representative) having only one vote. If no candidate
   receives a majority for Vice President, then the Senate will select the
   Vice President, with each Senator having one vote.

   Critics argue that the Electoral College is inherently undemocratic and
   gives swing states disproportionate influence in electing the President
   and Vice President. The Electoral College gives a numeric advantage in
   the election of the president to the smaller states, as the minimum
   number of electors for the small states is three compared to one for
   the election of representatives. On the other hand, the winner-take-all
   method of voting favors the larger states. On four occasions, most
   recently in 2000, the Electoral College system has resulted in the
   election of a candidate who did not receive the most popular votes in
   the election.^[8]^[9] A number of constitutional amendments have been
   proposed seeking to alter the Electoral College or replace it with a
   direct popular vote.^[10]

Background[edit]

   The Constitutional Convention in 1787 used the Virginia Plan as the
   basis for discussions, as the Virginia delegation had proposed it
   first. The Virginia Plan called for the Congress to elect the
   President.^[11] Delegates from a majority of states agreed to this mode
   of election.^[12] However, the Committee of Eleven, formed to work out
   various details including the mode of election of the President,
   recommended instead that the election be by a group of people
   apportioned among the states in the same numbers as their
   representatives in Congress (the formula for which had been resolved in
   lengthy debates resulting in the Connecticut Compromise and
   Three-fifths compromise), but chosen by each state "in such manner as
   its Legislature may direct." Committee member Gouverneur Morris
   explained the reasons for the change; among others, there were fears of
   "intrigue" if the President was chosen by a small group of men who met
   together regularly, as well as concerns for the independence of the
   President if he was elected by the Congress.^[13] Some delegates,
   including James Wilson and James Madison, preferred popular election of
   the executive. Madison acknowledged that while a popular vote would be
   ideal, it would be difficult to get consensus on the proposal given the
   prevalence of slavery in the South:

     There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an
     immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more
     diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter
     could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes. The
     substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the
     whole to be liable to the fewest objections.^[14]

   The Convention approved the Committee's Electoral College proposal,
   with minor modifications, on September 6, 1787.^[15] Delegates from the
   small states generally favored the Electoral College out of concern
   that the large states would otherwise control presidential
   elections.^[16]

Etymology[edit]

   Although the United States Constitution refers to "Electors" and
   "electors", neither the phrase "Electoral College" nor any other name
   is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the
   early 19th century that the name "Electoral College" came into general
   usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast
   votes for President and Vice President. It was first written into
   federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in 3 U.S.C. § 4, in the
   section heading and in the text as "college of electors."^[17]

Original plan[edit]

   Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution states:

     Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
     may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
     Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in
     the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
     Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be
     appointed an Elector.

   Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 of the Constitution states:

     The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and
     the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the
     same throughout the United States.

   Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution provided for the
   original fashion by which the President and Vice President were to be
   chosen by the electors. In the original system, the candidate who
   received both the most votes and votes from more than half of the
   electors would become President; the candidate receiving the second
   most votes would become Vice President.

   The design of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions
   and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:^[18]
    1. Each state would employ the district system of allocating electors.
    2. Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when
       voting.
    3. Candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed
       placements toward each office of President and Vice President.
    4. The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending
       the election to Congress.

   On these facts, some scholars have described the Electoral College as
   being intended to nominate candidates from which the Congress would
   then select a President and Vice President.^[19]

   Each state government is free to have its own plan for selecting its
   electors. Several different methods are described at length below.

Breakdown and revision[edit]

   The emergence of political parties and nationally coordinated election
   campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of 1796 and 1800.
   In 1796, Federalist Party candidate John Adams won the presidential
   election; by finishing in second place, Democratic-Republican Party
   candidate Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists' opponent, became the Vice
   President. This resulted in the President and Vice President not being
   of the same political party.

   In 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for
   President, and also nominated Aaron Burr for Vice President. After the
   election, Jefferson and Burr both obtained a majority of electoral
   votes, but tied one another with 73 votes each. Since ballots did not
   distinguish between votes for President and votes for Vice President,
   every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to
   become President, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first
   choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the
   election had to be decided by the House of Representatives pursuant to
   the Constitution's contingency election provision.

   Having already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party
   Representatives in the lame duck House session seized upon the
   opportunity to embarrass their opposition and attempted to elect Burr
   over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither
   candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations
   in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for an election).
   Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after
   Federalist Party leader Alexander Hamilton—who disfavored Burr's
   personal character more than Jefferson's policies—had made known his
   preference for Jefferson.

   Responding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed
   the Twelfth Amendment in 1803—prescribing electors cast separate
   ballots for President and Vice President—to replace the system outlined
   in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3. By June 1804, the states had
   ratified the amendment in time for the 1804 election.

Fourteenth Amendment[edit]

   Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment allows for a state's
   representation in the House of Representatives to be reduced to the
   extent that state unconstitutionally denies people the right to vote.

   On May 8, 1866, during a debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, Thaddeus
   Stevens, the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,
   delivered a speech on the amendment's intent. Regarding Section 2, he
   said:^[20]

     The second section I consider the most important in the article. It
     fixes the basis of representation in Congress. If any State shall
     exclude any of her adult male citizens from the elective franchise,
     or abridge that right, she shall forfeit her right to representation
     in the same proportion. The effect of this provision will be either
     to compel the States to grant universal suffrage or so shear them of
     their power as to keep them forever in a hopeless minority in the
     national Government, both legislative and executive.^[21]

   Federal law (2 U.S.C. § 6) implements Section 2's mandate.

Bayh–Celler Constitutional amendment[edit]

   The closest the country has ever come to abolishing the Electoral
   College occurred during the 91st Congress (1969-1971).^[22] The
   presidential election of 1968 resulted in Richard Nixon receiving 301
   electoral votes (56% of electors), Hubert Humphrey 191 (35.5%) and
   George Wallace 46 (8.5%) with 13.5% of the popular vote. However, Nixon
   had only received 511,944 more popular votes than Humphrey, 43.5% to
   42.9%, less than 1% of the national total.^[23]

   Representative Emanuel Celler (D – New York), Chairman of the House
   Judiciary Committee, responded to public concerns over the disparity
   between the popular vote and electoral vote by introducing House Joint
   Resolution 681, a proposed Constitutional amendment which would have
   replaced the Electoral College with simpler plurality system based on
   the national popular vote. With this system, the pair of candidates who
   had received the highest number of votes would win the Presidency and
   Vice Presidency providing they won at least 40% of the national popular
   vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election
   would be held in which the choice of President and Vice President would
   be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest
   number of votes in the first election. The word "pair" was defined as
   "two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as
   candidates for the offices of President and Vice President."^[24]

   On April 29, 1969, the House Judiciary Committee voted 28 to 6 to
   approve the proposal.^[25] Debate on the proposal before the full House
   of Representatives ended on September 11, 1969^[26] and was eventually
   passed with bipartisan support on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 339
   to 70.^[27]

   On September 30, 1969, President Richard Nixon gave his endorsement for
   adoption of the proposal, encouraging the Senate to pass its version of
   the proposal which had been sponsored as Senate Joint Resolution 1 by
   Senator Birch Bayh (D – Indiana).^[28]

   On October 8, 1969, the New York Times reported that 30 state
   legislatures were "either certain or likely to approve a constitutional
   amendment embodying the direct election plan if it passes its final
   Congressional test in the Senate." Ratification of 38 state
   legislatures would have been needed for adoption. The paper also
   reported that 6 other states had yet to state a preference, 6 were
   leaning toward opposition and 8 were solidly opposed.^[29]

   On August 14, 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent its report
   advocating passage of the proposal to the full Senate. The Judiciary
   Committee had approved the proposal by a vote of 11 to 6. The six
   members who opposed the plan, Democratic Senators James Eastland of
   Mississippi, John Little McClellan of Arkansas and Sam Ervin of North
   Carolina along with Republican Senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska, Hiram
   Fong of Hawaii and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, all argued that
   although the present system had potential loopholes, it had worked well
   throughout the years. Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the
   measure were about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the
   proposal to pass the full Senate. He called upon President Nixon to
   attempt to persuade undecided Republican Senators to support the
   proposal.^[30] However, Nixon, while not reneging on his previous
   endorsement, chose not to make any further personal appeals to back the
   proposal.^[31]

   Open debate on the proposal in the Senate commenced on September 8,
   1970^[32] and was quickly subjected to a filibuster. The lead objectors
   to the proposal were mostly Southern Senators and conservatives from
   small states, both Democrats and Republicans, who argued abolishing the
   Electoral College would reduce their states' political influence.^[31]
   On September 17, 1970, a motion for cloture, which would have ended the
   filibuster, received 54 votes to 36 for cloture,^[31] failing to
   receive the then required two-thirds majority of Senators voting.^[33]
   A second motion for cloture on September 29, 1970 also failed, by 53 to
   34. Thereafter, the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana,
   moved to lay the proposal aside so that the Senate could attend to
   other business.^[34] However, the proposal was never considered again
   and died when the 91st Congress ended on January 3, 1971. Hi!!

Modern mechanics[edit]

   The constitutional theory behind the indirect election of both the
   President and Vice President of the United States is that while the
   Congress is popularly elected by the people,^[35] the President and
   Vice President are elected to be executives of a federation of
   independent states.

   In the Federalist No. 39, James Madison argued that the Constitution
   was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based
   government. The Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate
   and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the
   President would be elected by a mixture of the two modes.^[36]

   Additionally, in the Federalist No. 10, James Madison argued against
   "an interested and overbearing majority" and the "mischiefs of faction"
   in an electoral system. He defined a faction as "a number of citizens
   whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are
   united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest,
   adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and
   aggregate interests of the community." Republican government (i.e.,
   federalism, as opposed to direct democracy), with its varied
   distribution of voter rights and powers, would countervail against
   factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No. 10 that the
   greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty
   factions would face in organizing due to such issues as
   sectionalism.^[37]

Summary[edit]

   Presidential electors are selected on a state-by-state basis, as
   determined by the laws of each state. Generally (with Maine and
   Nebraska being the exceptions), each state appoints its electors on a
   winner-take-all basis, based on the statewide popular vote on Election
   Day. Although ballots list the names of the presidential candidates,
   voters within the 50 states and Washington, D.C. actually choose
   electors for their state when they vote for President and Vice
   President. These presidential electors in turn cast electoral votes for
   those two offices. Even though the aggregate national popular vote is
   calculated by state officials and media organizations, the national
   popular vote is not the basis for electing a President or Vice
   President.

   A candidate must receive an absolute majority of electoral votes
   (currently 270) to win the Presidency. If no candidate receives a
   majority in the election for President, or Vice President, that
   election is determined via a contingency procedure in the Twelfth
   Amendment, which is explained in detail below.

Electors[edit]

Apportionment[edit]

   Further information: United States congressional apportionment
   State population per electoral vote for the 50 states and Washington
   D.C.

   A state's number of electors equals the number of representatives and
   senators the state has in the United States Congress.^[38]^[39] In the
   case of representatives, this is based on the respective populations.
   Each state's number of representatives is determined every 10 years by
   the United States Census. In the case of senators, each state is
   entitled to two.

   Under the Twenty-third Amendment, Washington, D.C. is allocated as many
   electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than
   the least populous state. The least populous state (Wyoming, as of
   2011^[update]) has three electors; thus, D.C. cannot have more than
   three electors. Even if D.C. were a state, its population would entitle
   it to only three electors; based on its population per electoral vote,
   D.C. has the second highest per-capita Electoral College
   representation, after Wyoming.^[40]

   Currently, there is a total of 538 electors, there being 435
   representatives and 100 senators, plus the three electors allocated to
   Washington, D.C.. The six states with the most electors are California
   (55), Texas (38), New York (29), Florida (29), Illinois (20) and
   Pennsylvania (20). The seven smallest states by population—Alaska,
   Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and
   Wyoming—have three electors each. This is because each of these states
   are entitled to one representative and two senators.

Selection[edit]

   Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution requires each state
   legislature to determine how electors for the state are to be chosen,
   but it disqualifies any person holding a federal office, either elected
   or appointed, from being an elector.^[41] Under Section 3 of the
   Fourteenth Amendment, any person who has sworn an oath to support the
   United States Constitution in order to hold either a state or federal
   office, and later rebelled against the United States, is disqualified
   from being an elector. However, the Congress may remove this
   disqualification by a two-thirds vote in each House.

   Candidates for elector are nominated by their state political parties
   in the months prior to Election Day. In some states, the electors are
   nominated in primaries, the same way that other candidates are
   nominated. In some states, such as Oklahoma, Virginia and North
   Carolina, electors are nominated in party conventions. In Pennsylvania,
   the campaign committee of each candidate names their candidates for
   elector (an attempt to discourage faithless electors).^[42]

   The Tuesday following the first Monday in November has been fixed as
   the day for holding federal elections, called the Election Day.^[43]
   Forty eight states and Washington, D.C., employ the "winner-takes-all
   method", each awarding its electors as a single bloc. Maine and
   Nebraska use the "congressional district method", selecting one elector
   within each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the
   remaining two electors by a statewide popular vote. This method has
   been used in Maine since 1972 and in Nebraska since 1996.^[6]

   The current system of choosing electors is called the "short ballot."
   In most states, voters choose a slate of electors, and only a few
   states list on the ballot the names of proposed electors. In some
   states, if a voter wants to write in a candidate for President, the
   voter is also required to write in the names of proposed electors.^[42]

   After the election each state prepares seven Certificates of
   Ascertainment, each listing the candidates for President and Vice
   President, their pledged electors, and the total votes each candidacy
   received.^[44] One certificate is sent, as soon after Election Day as
   practicable, to the National Archivist in Washington D.C. The
   Certificates of Ascertainment are mandated to carry the State Seal, and
   the signature of the Governor (in the case of the District of Columbia,
   the Certificate is signed by the Mayor of D.C.^[45]).

Meetings[edit]

   Certificate for the electoral vote for Rutherford B. Hayes and William
   A. Wheeler for the State of Louisiana

   The Electoral College never actually meets as one body. Electors chosen
   on Election Day meet in their respective state capitals (or in the case
   of the District of Columbia, within the District) on the Monday after
   the second Wednesday in December, at which time they cast their
   electoral votes on separate ballots for President and Vice
   President.^[46]^[47]^[48]

   Although procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally
   follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional
   authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is
   opened by the election certification official—often that state's
   secretary of state or equivalent—who reads the Certificate of
   Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the
   electoral votes. Each elector present answers to his name, and any
   vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a
   president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice
   chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself
   an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states,
   political officials give short speeches at this point in the
   proceedings.

   When the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two
   people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in
   nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate
   for President of the political party of the electors). Each elector
   submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for President. In
   New Jersey, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the
   candidate on a pre-printed card; in North Carolina, the electors write
   the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the
   ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the
   vote for Vice President, which follows a similar pattern.

   Each state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each
   Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a
   Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the
   Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names
   of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of
   President or of Vice President. The electors certify the Certificates
   of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following
   fashion:^[49]
     * One is sent by registered mail to the President of the Senate (who
       usually is the Vice President);
     * Two are sent by registered mail to the Archivist of the United
       States;
     * Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and
     * One is sent to the chief judge of the United States district court
       where those electors met.

   A staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates
   of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the
   Congress. The Certificates are arranged—unopened—in alphabetical order
   and placed in two special mahogany boxes. Alabama through Missouri
   (including the District of Columbia) are placed in one box and Montana
   through Wyoming are placed in the other box.^[50]

   A faithless elector is one who casts an electoral vote for someone
   other than the person pledged or does not vote for any person. 24
   states have laws to punish faithless electors. In 1952, the
   constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought before the Supreme
   Court in Ray v. Blair, 343 U.S. 214 (1952). The Court ruled in favor of
   state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning
   candidate, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. As stated
   in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not
   the federal government. Therefore, states have the right to govern
   electors. The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for
   actually casting a faithless vote, rather than refusing to pledge, has
   never been decided by the Supreme Court. While many only punish a
   faithless elector after-the-fact, states like Michigan also specify
   that the faithless elector's vote be voided.^[51]

   As electoral slates are typically chosen by the political party or the
   party's presidential nominee, electors usually have high loyalty to the
   party and its candidate: a faithless elector runs a greater risk of
   party censure than criminal charges.

   Faithless electors have not changed the outcome of any presidential
   election to date. For example, in 2000 elector Barbara Lett-Simmons of
   Washington, D.C. chose not to vote, rather than voting for Al Gore as
   she had pledged to do. This was done as an act of protest against
   Washington, D.C.'s lack of congressional voting representation.^[52]
   That elector's abstention did not change who won that year's
   presidential election, as George W. Bush received a majority (271) of
   the electoral votes.

Joint session of Congress and the contingent election[edit]

   The Twelfth Amendment mandates that the Congress assemble in joint
   session to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the
   election.^[53] The session is ordinarily required to take place on
   January 6 in the calendar year immediately following the meetings of
   the presidential electors.^[54] Since the Twentieth Amendment, the
   newly elected House declares the winner of the election; all elections
   before 1936 were determined by the outgoing House instead.

   The meeting is held at 1:00 pm in the Chamber of the U.S. House of
   Representatives.^[54] The sitting Vice President is expected to
   preside, but in several cases the President pro tempore of the Senate
   has chaired the proceedings instead. The Vice President and the Speaker
   of the House sit at the podium, with the Vice President in the seat of
   the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes
   containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in
   front of the Senators and Representatives. Each house appoints two
   tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political
   party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each
   state, in alphabetical order.

   Members of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided that
   the objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one
   member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least
   one Senator and one Representative will be followed by the suspension
   of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of
   Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint
   session is resumed. A State's certificate of vote can be rejected only
   if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection. In that case,
   the votes from the State in question are simply ignored. The votes of
   Arkansas and Louisiana were rejected in the presidential election of
   1872.^[55]

   Objections to the electoral vote count are rarely raised, although it
   did occur during the vote count in 2001 after the close 2000
   presidential election between Governor George W. Bush of Texas and the
   Vice President of the United States, Al Gore. Vice President Gore, who
   as Vice President was required to preside over his own Electoral
   College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of
   which were raised only by several House members and would have favored
   his candidacy, after no Senators would agree to jointly object.
   Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections,
   and on that occasion the document was presented by one Representative
   and one Senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the
   objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of
   Congress. If there are no objections or all objections are overruled,
   the presiding officer simply includes a State's votes, as declared in
   the certificate of vote, in the official tally.

   After the certificates from all States are read and the respective
   votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final
   result of the vote and, provided that the required absolute majority of
   votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected President
   and Vice President. This announcement concludes the joint session and
   formalizes the recognition of the President-elect and of the Vice
   President-elect. The Senators then depart from the House Chamber. The
   final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.

Contingent presidential election by House[edit]

   Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the House of Representatives is
   required to go into session immediately to vote for President if no
   candidate for President receives a majority of the electoral votes
   (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).

   In this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from
   among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. Each
   state delegation votes en bloc – each delegation having a single vote;
   the District of Columbia does not receive a vote. A candidate must
   receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at
   present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become
   the President-elect. Additionally, delegations from at least two-thirds
   of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House
   continues balloting until it elects a President.

   The House of Representatives has chosen the President only twice: once
   under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 (in 1801) and once under the
   Twelfth Amendment (in 1825).

Contingent vice presidential election by Senate[edit]

   If no candidate for Vice President receives an absolute majority of
   electoral votes, then the Senate must go into session to elect a Vice
   President. The Senate is limited to choosing from only the top two
   candidates to have received electoral votes (one fewer than the number
   to which the House is limited). The Senate votes in the normal manner
   in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each Senator, not
   by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the Senators must be
   present for voting to take place.

   Additionally, the Twelfth Amendment states that a "majority of the
   whole number" of Senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for
   election.^[56] Further, the language requiring an absolute majority of
   Senate votes precludes the sitting Vice President from breaking any tie
   which might occur,^[57] although this is disputed by some legal
   scholars.^[58]

   The only time the Senate chose the Vice President was in 1837. In that
   instance, the Senate adopted an alphabetical roll call and voting
   aloud. The rules further stated, "[I]f a majority of the number of
   Senators shall vote for either the said Richard M. Johnson or Francis
   Granger, he shall be declared by the presiding officer of the Senate
   constitutionally elected Vice President of the United States..."
   (Johnson won).^[59]

Deadlocked chambers[edit]

   If the House of Representatives has not chosen a President-elect in
   time for the inauguration (noon on January 20), then Section 3 of the
   Twentieth Amendment specifies that the Vice President-elect becomes
   Acting President until the House selects a President. If the winner of
   the vice presidential election is also not known by then, then under
   the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the sitting Speaker of the
   House would become Acting President until either the House selects a
   President or the Senate selects a Vice President. None of these
   situations has ever occurred.

   Key A Popular vote, At-large D Popular vote, Districting L Legislative
   selection H Hybrid system

   Before the advent of the short ballot in the early 20th century, as
   described above, the most common means of electing the presidential
   electors was through the general ticket. The general ticket is quite
   similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the
   general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for
   presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots
   for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state
   canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for
   elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple
   positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are
   often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot
   was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted
   for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932. Alabama was still using the
   general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch
   to the short ballot.

   The question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain
   the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been
   touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In McPherson v. Blacker,
   146 U.S. 1 (1892), the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause 2
   which states that a state's electors are selected "in such manner as
   the legislature thereof may direct" and wrote that these words
   "operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to
   circumscribe the legislative power." In Bush v. Palm Beach County
   Canvassing Board, 531 U.S. 70 (2000), a Florida Supreme Court decision
   was vacated (not reversed) based on McPherson. On the other hand, three
   dissenting justices in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), wrote:
   "nothing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state
   legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created
   it."^[63]

Appointment by state legislature[edit]

   The original method of choosing electors was by state legislative
   choice. A majority of the states selected presidential electors by
   legislation in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and half of the
   states did so in 1812.^[64] Even in the 1824 election, a quarter of
   states (6 of 24) chose electors by legislation. In that election,
   Andrew Jackson lost in spite of having pluralities of both the popular
   and electoral votes,^[65] with the outcome being decided by the six
   state legislatures choosing the electors. By 1828, only Delaware and
   South Carolina used legislative choice.^[65] Delaware ended its
   practice the following election (1832), while South Carolina continued
   using the method until it seceded from the Union in December 1860.^[65]

   Excluding South Carolina, legislative appointment was used in only four
   situations after 1832:
     * In 1848, Massachusetts statute awarded the state's electoral votes
       to the winner of the at-large popular vote, but only if that
       candidate won an absolute majority. When the vote produced no
       winner between the Democratic, Free Soil, and Whig parties, the
       state legislature selected the electors, giving all 12 electoral
       votes to the Whigs.^[66]
     * In 1864, Nevada, having joined the Union only a few days prior to
       Election Day, had no choice but to appoint.^[66]
     * In 1868, the newly reconstructed state of Florida appointed its
       electors, having been readmitted too late to hold elections.^[66]
     * Finally, in 1876, the legislature of the newly admitted state of
       Colorado used legislative choice due to a lack of time and money to
       hold an election.^[66]

   Legislative appointment was brandished as a possibility in the 2000
   election. Had the recount continued, the Florida legislature was
   prepared to appoint the Republican slate of electors to avoid missing
   the federal safe-harbor deadline for choosing electors.^[67]

   The Constitution gives each state legislature the power to decide how
   its state's electors are chosen^[65] and it can be easier and cheaper
   for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to
   create a legislative framework for holding elections to determine the
   electors. As noted above, the two situations in which legislative
   choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there
   was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However,
   appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences:
   bicameral legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate.
   This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the
   legislature failed to appoint any electors.^[68]

Electoral districts[edit]

   Another method used early in U.S. history was to divide the state into
   electoral districts. By this method, voters in each district would cast
   their ballots for the candidate they supported and the winner in each
   district would receive that electoral vote. This was similar to how
   states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the
   difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more
   electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional
   districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to gerrymandering.

   All states had discarded this method of elector selection after 1832.
   However, this method reappeared in Michigan for the 1892 election.^[66]
   Before the election, the Democratic Party had gained control of
   Michigan's state legislature and changed the method used from at-large
   popular voting to electoral district voting in order to capture at
   least a portion of the state's electoral votes (at the time, Michigan
   tended to vote Republican).^[66] The plan worked, and Michigan split
   its vote: nine votes for Republican Benjamin Harrison and five votes
   for Democrat Grover Cleveland. Once the Republican party regained
   control of the state legislature, the method of elector selection was
   switched back to at-large popular voting.^[66]

Proportional vote[edit]

   Under such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the
   votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by
   the statewide plurality vote.^[69]

Congressional District Method[edit]

   There are two versions of the Congressional District Method: one has
   been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another that has been proposed
   in Virginia. Under the implemented Congressional District Method, the
   electoral votes are distributed based on the popular vote winner within
   each of the state’s congressional districts; the statewide popular vote
   winner receives two additional electoral votes.^[70]

   In 2013, a different version of the Congressional District Method was
   proposed in Virginia. This version would distribute Virginia's
   electoral votes based on the popular vote winner within each of
   Virginia's congressional districts; the two statewide electoral votes
   would be awarded based on which candidate won the most congressional
   districts, rather than on who won Virginia's statewide popular
   vote.^[71]

   The Congressional District Method can more easily be implemented than
   other alternatives to the winner-takes-all method. State legislation is
   sufficient to use this method.^[72] However, the Congressional District
   Method has its downsides. For instance, candidates might only spend
   time in certain battleground districts instead of the entire state and
   cases of gerrymandering could become exacerbated as political parties
   attempt to draw as many safe districts as they can.^[73]

Implementation[edit]

   Of the 43 states whose electoral votes could be affected by the
   Congressional District Method, only Maine and Nebraska apply it. Maine
   has four electoral votes, based on its two Representatives and two
   Senators. Nebraska has two Senators and three Representatives, giving
   it five electoral votes.^[74] Maine began using the Congressional
   District Method in the election of 1972. Nebraska has used the
   Congressional District Method since the election of 1992.^[75]^[76]

   The Congressional District Method allows a state the chance to split
   its electoral votes between multiple candidates. Before 2008, neither
   Maine nor Nebraska had ever split their electoral votes.^[70] Nebraska
   split its electoral votes for the first time in 2008, giving John
   McCain its statewide electors and those of two congressional districts,
   while Barack Obama won the electoral vote of Nebraska's 2nd
   congressional district.^[77] Following the 2008 split, some Nebraska
   Republicans made efforts to discard the Congressional District Method
   and return to the winner-takes-all system.^[78] In January 2010, a bill
   was introduced in the Nebraska legislature to revert to a
   winner-take-all system;^[79] the bill died in committee in March
   2011.^[80] Republicans had also passed bills in 1995 and 1997 to
   eliminate the Congressional District Method in Nebraska, but those
   bills were vetoed by Democratic Governor Ben Nelson.^[78]

   In 2010, Republicans in Pennsylvania, who control both houses of the
   legislature as well as the governorship, put forward a plan to change
   the state's winner-takes-all system to a Congressional District Method
   system. Pennsylvania has voted for the Democratic candidate in the five
   previous presidential elections, so many saw this as an attempt to take
   away Democratic electoral votes. Barack Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008,
   but he only won a minority of the state's congressional
   districts.^[81]^[82] The plan later lost support.^[83]

Contemporary conflict[edit]

   Arguments between proponents and opponents of the current electoral
   system include four separate but related topics: indirect election,
   disproportionate voting power by some states, the winner-takes-all
   distribution method (as chosen by 48 of the 50 states), and federalism.
   Arguments against the Electoral College in common discussion mostly
   focus on the allocation of the voting power among the states. Gary
   Bugh’s research of congressional debates over proposed Electoral
   College amendments reveals that reform opponents have often appealed to
   a traditional version of representation, whereas reform advocates have
   tended to reference a more democratic view.^[84]

Criticism[edit]

Irrelevancy of national popular vote[edit]

   This graphic demonstrates how the winner of the popular vote can still
   lose in a hypothetical electoral college system.
   A bar graph of popular votes in presidential elections, with blue stars
   marking the four elections in which the winner did not have the
   plurality of the popular vote. Black squares mark the cases where the
   electoral vote resulted in a tie, or the winner did not have the
   majority of electoral votes. An 'H' marks the two cases where the
   election was decided by the House, and an 'S' marks the one case where
   the election was finalized by the Supreme Court.

   The elections of 1876, 1888, and 2000 produced an Electoral College
   winner who did not receive the plurality of the nationwide popular
   vote.^[85] In 1824, there were six states in which electors were
   legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so the true
   national popular vote is uncertain. When no candidate received a
   majority of electoral votes in 1824, the election was decided by the
   House of Representatives and so could be considered distinct from the
   latter three elections in which all of the states had popular selection
   of electors.^[86]

   Opponents of the Electoral College claim that such outcomes do not
   logically follow the normative concept of how a democratic system
   should function. One view is that the Electoral College violates the
   principle of political equality, since presidential elections are not
   decided by the one-person one-vote principle.^[85] Outcomes of this
   sort are attributable to the federal nature of the system. From such a
   configuration, argue supporters of the Electoral College, candidates
   must build a popular base that is geographically broader and more
   diverse in voter interests. This feature is not a logical consequence
   of having intermediate elections of Presidents, but rather the
   winner-takes-all method of allocating each state's slate of electors.
   Allocation of electors in proportion to the state's popular vote could
   reduce this effect.

   Scenarios exhibiting this outcome typically result when the winning
   candidate has won the requisite configuration of states (and thus their
   votes) by small margins, but the losing candidate captured large voter
   margins in the remaining states. In this case, the very large margins
   secured by the losing candidate in the other states would aggregate to
   well over 50 percent of the ballots cast nationally. In a two-candidate
   race, with equal voter turnout in every district and no faithless
   electors, a candidate could win the electoral college while winning
   only about 22% of the nationwide popular vote. This would require the
   candidate in question to win each one of the following states by just
   one vote: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut,
   Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
   Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
   Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
   Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South
   Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West
   Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.^[87]

   A result of the present functionality of the Electoral College is that
   the national popular vote bears no legal or factual significance on
   determining the outcome of the election. Since the national popular
   vote is irrelevant, both voters and candidates are assumed to base
   their campaign strategies around the existence of the Electoral
   College; any close race has candidates campaigning to maximize
   electoral votes by capturing coveted swing states, not to maximize
   national popular vote totals.

     The United States is the only country that elects a politically
     powerful president via an electoral college and the only one in
     which a candidate can become president without having obtained the
     highest number of votes in the sole or final round of popular
     voting.

   —George C. Edwards, 2011^[85]

Exclusive focus on large swing states[edit]

   Main article: Swing state
   These maps show the amount of attention given to each state by the Bush
   and Kerry campaigns during the final five weeks of the 2004 election.
   At the top, each waving hand represents a visit from a presidential or
   vice-presidential candidate during the final five weeks. At the bottom,
   each dollar sign represents one million dollars spent on TV advertising
   by the campaigns during the same time period.

   According to this criticism, the electoral college encourages political
   campaigners to focus on a few so-called "swing states" while ignoring
   the rest of the country. Populous states in which pre-election poll
   results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits,
   saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party
   organizers and debates, while "four out of five" voters in the national
   election are "absolutely ignored," according to one assessment.^[88]
   Since most states use a winner-takes-all arrangement in which the
   candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's
   electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively
   on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states
   have included Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida in 2004 and 2008, and
   also Colorado in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such
   as California, Texas, and New York, have in recent elections been
   considered "safe" for a particular party––Democratic for California and
   New York and Republican for Texas––and therefore campaigns spend less
   time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be
   "safe" for one of the two political parties and are also generally
   ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably
   Democratic, six are reliably Republican and only New Hampshire is
   considered as a swing state, according to critic George C. Edwards
   III.^[85] In the 2008 election, campaigns did not mount nationwide
   efforts but rather focused on select states.^[85]

   It is possible to win the election by winning eleven states and
   disregarding the rest of the country. If one ticket were to take
   California (55 votes), Texas (38), New York (29), Florida (29),
   Illinois (20), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), Georgia
   (16), North Carolina (15), and New Jersey (14) that ticket would have
   270 votes, which would be enough to win. In the close elections of 2000
   and 2004, these eleven states gave 111 votes to Republican candidate
   George W. Bush and 160 votes to Democratic candidates Al Gore and John
   Kerry. In 2008, the Democratic candidate Barack Obama won nine of these
   eleven states (for 222 electoral votes), with Republican John McCain
   taking a combined 49 electoral votes from Texas and Georgia.

   Proponents of the Electoral College claim that adoption of the popular
   vote would shift the disproportionate focus to large cities at the
   expense of rural areas.^[89] Candidates might also be inclined to
   campaign hardest in their base areas to maximize turnout among core
   supporters, and ignore more closely divided parts of the country.
   Proponents of a national popular vote for president dismiss such
   arguments, pointing out that candidates in popular vote elections for
   governor and U.S. Senate and for statewide allocation of electoral
   votes do not ignore voters in less populated areas.^[90]

Discourages turnout and participation[edit]

   Except in closely fought swing states, voter turnout is largely
   insignificant due to entrenched political party domination in most
   states. The Electoral College decreases the advantage a political party
   or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out, except in
   those swing states.^[91] If the presidential election were decided by a
   national popular vote, in contrast, campaigns and parties would have a
   strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere.^[92]
   Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their
   friends and neighbors to turn out to vote. The differences in turnout
   between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral
   college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct
   election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and
   participation significantly.^[91]

Obscures disenfranchisement within states[edit]

   According to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to
   a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it
   obscures any voting problems within a particular state. For example, if
   a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by voter
   suppression methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes,
   registration requirements, or legally disfranchising specific minority
   groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced. But the state's
   electoral count would be the same. So disenfranchisement has no effect
   on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such
   disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A
   related argument is that the Electoral College may have a dampening
   effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out
   to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the
   state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this
   view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated
   to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have
   more political clout nationally. Critics contend that the electoral
   college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as
   possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.

   Legal scholars Akhil Amar and Vikram Amar have argued that the original
   Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled
   the southern states to disenfranchise its slave populations.^[93] It
   permitted southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while
   allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation
   by using the three-fifths compromise. They noted that constitutional
   Framer James Madison believed that the question of counting slaves had
   presented a serious challenge but that "the substitution of electors
   obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to the
   fewest objections."^[88] Akhil and Vikram Amar added that:

     The founders' system also encouraged the continued disfranchisement
     of women. In a direct national election system, any state that gave
     women the vote would automatically have doubled its national clout.
     Under the Electoral College, however, a state had no such incentive
     to increase the franchise; as with slaves, what mattered was how
     many women lived in a state, not how many were empowered ... a state
     with low voter turnout gets precisely the same number of electoral
     votes as if it had a high turnout. By contrast, a well-designed
     direct election system could spur states to get out the vote.

   —Akhil and Vikram Amar^[93]

Lack of enfranchisement of U.S. territories[edit]

   See also: Voting rights in the United States § Overseas and nonresident
   citizens

   Territorial possessions of the United States, such as Puerto Rico and
   Guam, are not entitled to any electors in presidential elections.
   Constitutionally, only U.S. states (per Article II, Section 1, Clause
   2) and Washington, D.C. (per the Twenty-third Amendment) are entitled
   to any electors. Guam has held non-binding straw polls for president
   since the 1980s to draw attention to this fact.^[94]^[95] This has also
   led to various scholars concluding that the U.S. national-electoral
   process is not fully democratic.^[96]^[97]

Favors less populous states[edit]

   As a consequence of giving more per capita voting power to the less
   populated states, the Electoral College gives extra power to voters in
   those states. In one countervailing analysis about smaller states
   gaining an Electoral College advantage, the Banzhaf power index (BPI)
   model based on probability theory was used to test the hypothesis that
   citizens of small states accrue more election power. It was found that
   in 1990, individual voters in California, the largest state, had 3.3
   times more individual power to choose a President than voters of
   Montana, the largest of the minimum 3 elector states.^[98] Banzhaf's
   method has been criticized for treating votes like coin-flips, and more
   empirically based models of voting yield results which seem to favor
   larger states less.^[99]

Disadvantage for third parties[edit]

   See also: Duverger's law and Causes of a two-party system

   In practice, the winner-take-all manner of allocating a state's
   electors generally decreases the importance of minor parties.^[100]
   However, it has been argued that the electoral college is not a cause
   of the two-party system, and that it had a tendency to improve the
   chances of third-party candidates in some situations.^[85]

Not straightforward[edit]

   One view is that the electoral college is overly and unnecessarily
   complex:

     The electoral college does not provide a straightforward process for
     selecting the president. Instead, it can be extraordinarily complex
     and has the potential to undo the people's will at many points in
     the long journey from the selection of electors to counting their
     votes in Congress.

   —George Edwards, 2011^[85]

Prevents an urban-centric victory[edit]

   Proponents of the Electoral College claim the Electoral College
   prevents a candidate from winning the Presidency by simply winning in
   heavily populated urban areas. This means that candidates must make a
   wider geographic appeal than they would if they simply had to win the
   national popular vote.^[101]

   wider geographic appeal than they would if they simply had to win the
   national popular vote.^[102]

Maintains the federal character of the nation[edit]

   The United States of America is a federal coalition which consists of
   component states. Proponents of the current system argue that the
   collective opinion of even a small state merits attention at the
   federal level greater than that given to a small, though numerically
   equivalent, portion of a very populous state. The system also allows
   each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own
   laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to
   maximize the number of votes cast.

   For many years early in the nation's history, up until the Jacksonian
   Era, many states appointed their electors by a vote of the state
   legislature, and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the
   President must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the
   federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive,
   centralized government.^[103]

   In his book A More Perfect Constitution, Professor Larry Sabato
   elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to "mend
   it, don't end it," in part because of its usefulness in forcing
   candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing
   the role of the state in federalism.^[104]

Enhances status of minority groups[edit]

   Instead of decreasing the power of minority groups by depressing voter
   turnout, proponents argue that by making the votes of a given state an
   all-or-nothing affair, minority groups can provide the critical edge
   that allows a candidate to win. This encourages candidates to court a
   wide variety of such minorities and advocacy groups.^[103]

Encourages stability through the two-party system[edit]

   Many proponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on
   third parties as beneficial. They argue that the two party system has
   provided stability because it encourages a delayed adjustment during
   times of rapid political and cultural change. They believe it protects
   the most powerful office in the country from control by what these
   proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their
   views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a
   national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also
   be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor
   between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by
   candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won
   with less than 35% of the vote.^[105]

Flexibility if a presidential candidate dies[edit]

   According to this argument, the fact that the electoral college is made
   up of real people instead of mere numbers allows for human judgment and
   flexibility to make a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or
   becomes legally disabled around the time of the election. Advocates of
   the current system argue that human electors would be in a better
   position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting
   public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during
   the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in
   state ballots^[106] until mid-December when the electors formally cast
   their ballots.^[107] In the election of 1872, losing Democratic
   candidate Horace Greeley died during this time interval which resulted
   in Democratic disarray, but the Greeley electors were able to split
   their votes for different alternate candidates.^[108]^[109]^[110] A
   situation in which the winning candidate died has never happened. In
   the election of 1912, Vice President Sherman died shortly before the
   election when it was too late for states to remove his name from their
   ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the eight
   electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for
   Nicholas Murray Butler.^[111]

Isolation of election problems[edit]

   Some supporters of the Electoral College note that it isolates the
   impact of any election fraud, or other such problems, to the state
   where it occurs. It prevents instances where a party dominant in one
   state may dishonestly inflate the votes for a candidate and thereby
   affect the election outcome. For instance, recounts occur only on a
   state-by-state basis, not nationwide.^[112] Critics of the current
   system suggest that the results in a single state – such as Florida in
   2000 – can decide the national election and thus not keep any problems
   in such a state isolated from the rest of the nation.^[113]

National Popular Vote Interstate Compact[edit]

   Main article: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

   A proposal has been made to restore the one person one vote principle
   without having to change the Constitution which involves an interstate
   compact. Individual states agree to pledge their electors to the winner
   of the national popular vote, provided that enough other states follow
   suit.^[88] The state legislatures of the cooperating states would then
   establish a direct election, thereby effectively circumventing the
   Electoral College, since they would collectively have a majority (at
   least 270) of the electoral votes.

     This elegantly exploits one of the perversities of our current
     system—there’s no individual, federal right to have your ballot
     counted—and turns it against the system itself. It’s a state-based
     solution that could finally force a federal popular-vote election.
     And it’s gaining steam.

   — Katrina vanden Heuvel, in The Nation, 2012^[88]

   The proposal is based on the current rule in Article II, Section 1,
   Clause 2 of the Constitution which gives each state legislature the
   authority to determine how it chooses its electors. Many partial
   versions of this plan have emerged over the years.

   While each state has plenary power to determine how it chooses its
   electors, it is unclear whether Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 of the
   Constitution requires congressional consent before this compact could
   take effect.

   Eight states and the District of Columbia have joined the compact. The
   first was Maryland, when Governor Martin O'Malley signed the bill into
   law on April 10, 2007.^[114] New Jersey joined on January 13, 2008,
   despite objections from Republicans who criticized the bill as
   undermining federal elections.^[115] Illinois passed the law on April
   7, 2008.^[116] Hawaii joined on May 1, when the legislature overrode a
   veto from Governor Linda Lingle.^[117] On April 28, 2009, the State of
   Washington joined, when Governor Christine Gregoire signed HB
   1598.^[118] Massachusetts joined the compact on August 4, 2010, when
   Governor Deval Patrick signed that state's bill into law.^[119]
   Additionally, the District of Columbia, which has three electoral
   votes, joined the compact on December 7, 2010.^[120] Vermont joined the
   compact on April 22, 2011, when Governor Peter Shumlin signed that
   state's bill into law.^[121] On August 8, 2011, California joined when
   Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill adding California to the
   compact.^[122] As of July 2013^[update], adopters of the compact
   collectively had a total of 136 electoral votes, 134 votes short of the
   270 needed for an electoral college majority.
