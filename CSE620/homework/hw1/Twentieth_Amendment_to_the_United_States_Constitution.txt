Text[edit]

     Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end
     at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and
     Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in
     which such terms would have ended if this article had not been
     ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.

     Section 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year,
     and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January,
     unless they shall by law appoint a different day.

     Section 3. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of
     the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice
     President elect shall become President. If a President shall not
     have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his
     term, or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify, then
     the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President
     shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for the
     case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect
     shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or
     the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such
     person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President
     shall have qualified.

     Section 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death
     of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may
     choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved
     upon them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from
     whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of
     choice shall have devolved upon them.

     Section 5. Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of
     October following the ratification of this article.

     Section 6. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have
     been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the
     legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven
     years from the date of its submission.

History[edit]

   Section 1 of the amendment reduced the amount of time between Election
   Day and the beginning of Presidential, Vice Presidential and
   Congressional terms.^[2] Originally, the terms of the President, the
   Vice President and the incoming Congress began on March 4, four months
   after the elections were held. While this lapse was a practical
   necessity at the end of the 18th century, when any newly elected
   official might require several months to put his affairs in order and
   then undertake an arduous journey from his home to the national
   capital, it eventually had the effect of impeding the functioning of
   government in the modern age.

   From the early 19th century onward, it also meant that a lame duck
   Congress or Presidential administration could fail to adequately
   respond to a significant national crisis in a timely manner. Each
   institution could do this on the theory that at best, a lame duck
   Congress or administration had neither the time nor the mandate to
   tackle problems, whereas the incoming administration or Congress would
   have both the time, and a fresh electoral mandate, to examine and
   address the problems that the nation faced. These problems very likely
   would have been at the center of the debate of the just completed
   election cycle.

   This dilemma was seen most notably in 1861 and 1933, after the
   elections of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively,
   plus the newly elected Senators and Representatives. Under the
   Constitution at the time, these presidents had to wait four months
   before they, and the incoming Congresses, could deal with the secession
   of Southern states and the Great Depression respectively.

   Originally, under Article I, Section 4, Clause 2, the Congress was
   required to convene at least once each year on the first Monday in
   December. That requirement created a mandatory lame duck session
   following each federal election. Section 2 of the amendment changed
   this required convening to January 3.

   The amendment was ratified on January 23, 1933. Pursuant to Section 5
   of the amendment, the changes made by Sections 1 and 2 took effect on
   October 15, 1933. This delay resulted in first inauguration of
   President Roosevelt and Vice President John Garner taking place on
   March 4, 1933, but Congress would not have been required to meet until
   January 3, 1934. Therefore, pursuant to a presidential proclamation, a
   special 100-day session of Congress was convened from March 9, 1933, to
   June 16, 1933.

   On February 15, 1933, 23 days after this amendment was ratified,
   President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt was the target of an unsuccessful
   assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara. If the attempt had been
   successful then, pursuant to Section 3 of the amendment, Vice
   President-elect John N. Garner would have become President on March 4,
   1933.

   The first Congressional terms to begin under Section 1 were those of
   the 74th Congress, on January 3, 1935. The first Presidential and Vice
   Presidential terms to begin under Section 1 were the second terms of
   President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner, on January 20, 1937.

   Because of this amendment, if the Electoral College fails to resolve
   who will be the President or Vice President, the incoming Congress, as
   opposed to the outgoing one, would choose who would occupy the
   unresolved office or offices.^[3]
