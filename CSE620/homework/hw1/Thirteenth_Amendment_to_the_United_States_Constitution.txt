   The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished
   slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. It
   was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, by the House on January 31,
   1865, and adopted on December 6, 1865. On December 18, 1865, Secretary
   of State William H. Seward proclaimed its adoption. It was the first of
   the three Reconstruction Amendments adopted following the American
   Civil War.

   Slavery had been tacitly protected in the original Constitution through
   clauses such as the Three-Fifths Compromise, by which three-fifths of
   the slave population was counted for representation in the United
   States House of Representatives. Though many slaves had been declared
   free by Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, their post-war status
   was uncertain. On April 8, 1864, the Senate passed an amendment to
   abolish slavery. After one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative
   maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit on
   January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all
   Northern states, along with a sufficient number of border and
   "reconstructed" Southern states, to cause it to be adopted before the
   end of the year.

   Though the amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United
   States, factors such as Black Codes, white supremacist violence, and
   selective enforcement of statutes continued to subject some black
   Americans to involuntary labor, particularly in the South. In contrast
   to the other Reconstruction Amendments, the Thirteenth Amendment was
   rarely cited in later case law, but has been used to strike down
   peonage and some race-based discrimination as "badges and incidents of
   slavery". While the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments apply only to
   state actors, the Thirteenth applies also to private citizens. The
   amendment also enables Congress to pass laws against sex trafficking
   and other modern forms of slavery.

Text

     Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a
     punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly
     convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place
     subject to their jurisdiction.

     Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by
     appropriate legislation.^[1]

Slavery in the United States

   Abolitionist imagery focused on atrocities against slaves.^[2] (1863

   Slavery was introduced to the American colonies by Great Britain, which
   worked in concert with African tribal chiefs to capture entire tribes
   in sub Sahara Africa, which were transported by slavers to the new
   world.^[3]^[4] Eventually the institution of slavery existed in all of
   the original thirteen British North American colonies. Prior to the
   Thirteenth Amendment, the United States Constitution (adopted in 1789)
   did not expressly use the words slave or slavery but included several
   provisions about unfree persons. The Three-Fifths Clause (in Article I,
   Section 2) allocated Congressional representation based "on the whole
   Number of free Persons" and "three fifths of all other Persons". This
   clause was a compromise between Southerners who wished slaves to
   counted as 'persons' for congressional representation and northerners
   rejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South, because
   representation in the new Congress would be based on population in
   contrast to the one-vote-for-one-state principle in the earlier
   Continental Congress.^[5] Under the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV,
   Section 2), "No person held to Service or Labour in one State" would be
   freed by escaping to another. Article I, Section 9 allowed Congress to
   pass legislation outlawing the "Importation of Persons", but not until
   1808. However, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment—which states that,
   "No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
   due process of law"—slaves were understood as property.^[6] Although
   abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it
   became part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property with
   Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).^[7]

   Stimulated by the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence between
   1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or
   gradual abolition of slavery. Most of the slaves involved were
   household servants. No Southern state did so, and the slave population
   of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost 4 million people in
   1861. An abolitionist movement headed by such figures as William Lloyd
   Garrison grew in strength in the North, calling for the end of slavery
   nationwide and exacerbating tensions between North and South. The
   American Colonization Society, an alliance between abolitionists who
   felt the races should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared the
   presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions, called for
   the emigration and colonization of both free blacks and slaves to
   Africa. Its views were endorsed by politicians such as Henry Clay, who
   feared that the main abolitionist movement would provoke a civil
   war.^[8] Proposals to eliminate slavery by constitutional amendment
   were introduced by Representative Arthur Livermore in 1818 and by John
   Quincy Adams in 1839, but failed to gain significant traction.^[9]

   As the country continued to expand, the issue of slavery in its new
   territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position
   was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the
   territories like all other forms of property.^[10] The 1820 Missouri
   Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and
   Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the
   regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war
   appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the
   Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not
   the Senate.^[10] The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue
   by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger
   Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and
   allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery
   issue.^[11]

   Despite the compromise, tensions between North and South continued to
   rise over the subsequent decade, inflamed by, amongst other things, the
   publication of the 1852 anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin; fighting
   between pro-slave and abolitionist forces in Kansas, beginning in 1854;
   the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which struck down provisions of the
   Compromise of 1850; abolitionist John Brown's 1859 attempt to start a
   slave revolt at Harpers Ferry and the 1860 election of slavery critic
   Abraham Lincoln to the presidency. The Southern states seceded from the
   Union in the months following Lincoln's election, forming the
   Confederate States of America, and beginning the American Civil War.

Proposal and ratification

Crafting the amendment

   Representative James Mitchell Ashley proposed an amendment abolishing
   slavery in 1863.

   Acting under presidential war powers, Lincoln issued the Emancipation
   Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves
   in the ten states that were still in rebellion.^[12] However, it did
   not affect the status of slaves in the border states that had remained
   loyal to the Union.^[13] That December, Lincoln again used his war
   powers and issued a "Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction",
   which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union
   if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their
   voting population.^[14] Southern states did not readily accept the
   deal, and the status of slavery remained uncertain.

   In the final years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various
   proposals for Reconstruction.^[15] Some of these called for a
   constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently.
   On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced
   by Representative James Mitchell Ashley.^[16] Representative James F.
   Wilson soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864,
   Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for
   a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary
   Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull, became involved in merging
   different proposals for an amendment.

   Radical Republicans led by Senator Charles Sumner and Representative
   Thaddeus Stevens sought a more expansive version of the amendment.^[17]
   On February 8, 1864, Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment
   stating:

     “All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold
     another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all
     laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect
     everywhere in the United States.”^[18]^[19]

   Sumner tried to promote his own more expansive wording by circumventing
   the Trumbull-controlled Judiciary Committee, but failed.^[20] On
   February 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with
   an amendment proposal based on drafts of Ashley, Wilson and
   Henderson.^[21]^[22]

   The Committee's version used text from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787,
   which stipulates, "There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
   servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of
   crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."^[23]^[24]
   Though using Henderson's proposed amendment as the basis for its new
   draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have allowed
   a constitutional amendment to be adopted with only a majority vote in
   each House of Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states
   (instead of two-thirds and three-fourths, respectively).^[25]

Passage by Congress

   Further information: 38th United States Congress

   The Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6.
   However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed to do
   so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the
   two-thirds vote needed for passage; the vote split largely along party
   lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing.^[26] In the
   1864 presidential race, former Free Soil Party candidate John C.
   Frémont threatened a third party run opposing Lincoln, this time on a
   platform endorsing an anti-slavery amendment. The Republican Party
   platform had, as yet, failed to include a similar plank, though Lincoln
   endorsed the amendment in a letter accepting his nomination.^[27]^[28]
   Fremont withdrew from the race on September 22, 1864, and endorsed
   Lincoln.^[29]

   With no Southern states represented, few members of Congress pushed
   moral and religious arguments in favor of slavery. Democrats who
   opposed the amendment generally made arguments based on federalism and
   state's rights.^[30] Some argued that the proposed change so violated
   the spirit of the Constitution that it would not be a valid "amendment"
   but would instead constitute "revolution".^[31] Some opponents warned
   that the amendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks.^[32]

   Republicans argued that slavery was uncivilized and that abolition was
   a necessary step in national progress.^[33] Amendment supporters also
   argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people.
   These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced
   labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South.
   Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and
   other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in
   slave states.^[32]^[34]

   White Northern Republicans, and some Democrats, became excited about an
   abolition amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions.^[35]
   Many blacks, particularly in the South, focused more on landownership
   and education as the key to liberation.^[36] As slavery began to seem
   politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats gradually
   announced their support for the amendment, including Representative
   James Brooks,^[37] Senator Reverdy Johnson,^[38] and Tammany Hall, a
   powerful New York political machine.^[39]
   Celebration erupts after the amendment is passed by the House of
   Representatives.

   Lincoln had been concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation might be
   reversed or found invalid after the war and saw constitutional
   amendment as a more permanent solution.^[40]^[41] He had remained
   outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically
   too dangerous.^[42] Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved
   to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment.^[43]^[44] After winning
   the election of 1864, Lincoln made the passage of the Thirteenth
   Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning his efforts while the
   "lame duck" session was still in office.^[45]^[46] Popular support for
   the amendment was mounting and Lincoln urged Congress on in his
   December 6 State of the Union speech: “there is only a question of time
   as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their
   action. And as it is to so go, at all events, may we not agree that the
   sooner the better?”^[47]

   Secretary of State William H. Seward, Representative John B. Alley and
   others were instructed by Lincoln to procure votes by any means
   necessary, and promised government posts and campaign contributions to
   outgoing Democrats willing to switch sides.^[48]^[49] Seward had a
   large fund for direct bribes. Ashley, who reintroduced the measure into
   the House, also lobbied several Democrats to vote in favor of the
   measure.^[50] Representative Thaddeus Stevens commented later that "the
   greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption,
   aided and abetted by the purest man in America"; however, Lincoln's
   precise role in making deals for votes remains unknown.^[51]

   Republicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition, having gained
   in the elections for Senate and House.^[52] Opposition to the measure
   was led by the 1864 Democratic vice presidential nominee,
   Representative George H. Pendleton.^[53] Republicans toned down their
   language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's
   coalition of supporters.^[54] In order to reassure critics worried that
   the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans
   explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy
   intact.^[55]

   In mid-January, Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax estimated the
   amendment to be five votes short of passage. Ashley postponed the
   vote.^[56] At this point, Lincoln intensified his push for the
   amendment, making direct emotional appeals to particular members of
   Congress.^[57] On January 31, 1865, the House called another vote on
   the amendment, with neither side being certain of the outcome. Every
   Republican supported the measure, as well as 16 Democrats, almost all
   of them lame ducks. The amendment finally passed by a vote of 119 to
   56,^[58] narrowly reaching the required two-thirds majority.^[59] The
   House exploded into celebration, with some members openly weeping.^[60]
   Black onlookers, who had only been allowed to attend Congressional
   sessions since the previous year, cheered from the galleries.^[61]

   President Lincoln signed the amendment on February 1, 1865. The
   Thirteenth Amendment is the only ratified amendment signed by a
   President, although James Buchanan had signed the pro-slavery Corwin
   Amendment, which the 36th Congress had adopted and sent to the states
   in March 1861.^[62]^[63] The Thirteenth Amendment's archival copy bears
   Lincoln's signature, under the usual signatures of the Speaker of the
   House and the President of the Senate, after the date.^[64] On February
   7, Congress passed a resolution affirming that the Presidential
   signature was unnecessary.^[65]

Ratification by the states

   When the Thirteenth Amendment was submitted to the states on February
   1, 1865, it was quickly taken up by several legislatures. By the end of
   the month it had been ratified by eighteen states. Among them were the
   ex-confederate states of Virginia and Louisiana, where ratifications
   were submitted by Reconstruction governments. These, along with
   subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues
   of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures, and if there
   were fewer legislatures than states, did Article V require ratification
   by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid
   state legislatures?^[66] President Lincoln in his last speech, on April
   11, 1865, called the question about whether the Southern states were in
   or out of the Union a “pernicious abstraction.” Obviously, he declared,
   they were not “in their proper practical relation with the Union”;
   whence everyone's object should be to restore that relation.^[67]
   Lincoln was assassinated three days later.

   With Congress out of session, the new President, Andrew Johnson, began
   a period known as "Presidential Reconstruction", in which he personally
   oversaw the creation of new state governments throughout the South. He
   oversaw the convening of state political conventions populated by
   delegates whom he deemed to be loyal. Three leading issues came before
   the convention: secession itself, the abolition of slavery, and the
   Confederate war debt. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North
   Carolina, and South Carolina held conventions in 1865, while Texas'
   convention did not organize until March 1866.^[68]^[69]^[70] Johnson
   hoped to prevent deliberation over whether to re-admit the Southern
   states by accomplishing full ratification before Congress reconvened in
   December. He believed he could silence those who wished to deny the
   Southern states their place in the Union by pointing to how essential
   their assent had been to the successful ratification of the Thirteenth
   Amendment.^[71]

   Direct negotiations between state governments and the Johnson
   administration ensued. As the summer wore on, administration officials
   began including assurances of the measure's limited scope with their
   demands for ratification. Johnson himself suggested directly to the
   governors of Mississippi and North Carolina that they could proactively
   control the allocation of rights to freedmen. Though Johnson obviously
   expected the freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights,
   including, as he specified, the right to testify in court, he wanted
   state lawmakers to know that the power to confer such rights would
   remain with the states.^[72] When South Carolina provisional governor
   Benjamin Franklin Perry objected to the scope of the amendment's
   enforcement clause, Secretary of State Seward responded by telegraph
   that in fact the second clause "is really restraining in its effect,
   instead of enlarging the powers of Congress".^[72] White politicians
   throughout the South were concerned that Congress might cite the
   amendment's enforcement powers as a way to authorize black
   suffrage.^[73]

   When South Carolina ratified the amendment in November 1865, it issued
   its own interpretive declaration that "any attempt by Congress toward
   legislating upon the political status of former slaves, or their civil
   relations, would be contrary to the Constitution of the United
   States".^[74]^[75] Alabama and Louisiana also declared that their
   ratification did not imply federal power to legislate on the status of
   former slaves.^[76]^[77] During the first week of December, North
   Carolina and Georgia gave the amendment the final votes needed for it
   to become part of the Constitution.

   The Thirteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution on December 6,
   1865, based on the following ratifications:^[78]
    1. Illinois — February 1, 1865
    2. Rhode Island — February 2, 1865
    3. Michigan — February 3, 1865
    4. Maryland — February 3, 1865

   25. Alabama — December 2, 1865
   26. North Carolina — December 4, 1865
   27. Georgia — December 6, 1865

   Having been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the
   several states—27 of the 36 states (including those that had been in
   rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified
   that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and
   purposes, as a part of the Constitution.^[79] Included on the enrolled
   list of ratifying states were the three ex-confederate states that had
   given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their
   affirmative votes, brushed aside their interpretive declarations
   without comment, challenge or any acknowledgment at all.^[80]

   The Thirteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified by:^[78]
     * Oregon — December 8, 1865
     * California — December 19, 1865
     * Florida — December 28, 1865 (Reaffirmed – June 9, 1869)
     * Iowa — January 15, 1866
     * New Jersey — January 23, 1866 (After rejection – March 16, 1865)
     * Texas — February 18, 1870
     * Delaware — February 12, 1901 (After rejection – February 8, 1865)
     * Kentucky — March 18, 1976^[81] (After rejection – February 24,
       1865)
     * Mississippi — March 16, 1995; Certified – February 7, 2013^[82]
       (After rejection – December 5, 1865)

   The Thirteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution 61½ years
   after the Twelfth Amendment. To date, this is the longest interval of
   time between constitutional amendments.^[83]

Effects

   Amendment XIII in the National Archives, bearing the signature of
   Abraham Lincoln

   The impact of the abolition of slavery was felt quickly. When the
   Thirteenth Amendment became operational, the scope of Lincoln's 1863
   Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation.
   Although the majority of Kentucky's slaves had been emancipated,
   65,000–100,000 people remained to be legally freed when the Amendment
   went into effect on December 18.^[84]^[85] In Delaware, where a large
   number of slaves had escaped during the war, nine hundred people became
   legally free.^[85]^[86]

   In addition to abolishing slavery and prohibiting involuntary
   servitude, except as a punishment for crime, the Thirteenth Amendment
   also nullified the Fugitive Slave Clause and the Three-Fifths
   Compromise. The population of a state originally included (for
   congressional apportionment purposes) all "free persons", three-fifths
   of "other persons" (i.e., slaves) and excluded untaxed Native
   Americans. The Three-Fifths Compromise was a provision in the
   Constitution that required three-fifths of the population of slaves be
   counted for purposes of apportionment of seats in the House of
   Representatives and taxes among the states. This compromise had the
   effect of increasing the political power of slave-holding states by
   increasing their share of seats in the House of Representatives, and
   consequently their share in the Electoral College (where a state's
   influence over the election of the President is tied to the size of its
   congressional delegation).^[87]^[88]

   Even as the Thirteenth Amendment was working its way through the
   ratification process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly
   concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase the
   congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern
   states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted
   rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically
   increase their power in the population-based House of
   Representatives.^[89]^[90] Republicans hoped to offset this advantage
   by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black
   population.^[89]^[91]^[92]

Political and economic change in the South

   Southern culture remained deeply racist, and those blacks who remained
   faced a dangerous situation. J. J. Gries reported to the Joint
   Committee on Reconstruction: “There is a kind of innate feeling, a
   lingering hope among many in the South that slavery will be
   regalvanized in some shape or other. They tried by their laws to make a
   worse slavery than there was before, for the freedman has not the
   protection which the master from interest gave him before.”^[93] W. E.
   B. Du Bois wrote in 1935:

     Slavery was not abolished even after the Thirteenth Amendment. There
     were four million freedmen and most of them on the same plantation,
     doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as
     their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war.
     Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were
     going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were
     among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or on
     the streets of the cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They
     had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in
     exceptional cases, without legal status, and without
     protection.^[94]^[95]

   Official emancipation did not substantially alter the economic
   situation of most blacks who remained in the south.^[96]

   As the amendment still permitted labor as punishment for convicted
   criminals, Southern states responded with what historian Douglas A.
   Blackmon called "an array of interlocking laws essentially intended to
   criminalize black life".^[97] These laws, passed or updated after
   emancipation, were known as Black Codes.^[90] Mississippi was the first
   state to pass such codes, with an 1865 law titled “An Act to confer
   Civil Rights on Freedmen”.^[98] The Mississippi law required black
   workers to contract with white farmers by January 1 of each year or
   face punishment for vagrancy.^[97] Blacks could be sentenced to forced
   labor for crimes including petty theft, using obscene language, or
   selling cotton after sunset.^[99] States passed new, strict vagrancy
   laws that were selectively enforced against blacks without white
   protectors.^[97]^[100] The labor of these convicts was then sold to
   farms, factories, lumber camps, quarries, and mines.^[101]

   After its ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865,
   the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black
   Codes.^[102] The Black Codes created a separate set of laws,
   punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone with more than one
   black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as
   farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights.^[103]
   Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic
   subservience permanent.^[36]

   Some states mandated indefinitely long periods of child
   "apprenticeship".^[104] Some laws did not target Blacks specifically,
   but instead affected farm workers, most of whom were Black. At the same
   time, many states passed laws to actively prevent Blacks from acquiring
   property.^[105]

   Southern business owners sought to reproduce the profitable arrangement
   of slavery with a system called peonage, in which (disproportionately
   black) workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work
   indefinitely because of their debt.^[106]^[107] Peonage continued well
   through Reconstruction and ensnared a large proportion of black workers
   in the South.^[108] These workers remained destitute and persecuted,
   forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the
   racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South.^[107] Peonage differed
   from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not
   allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a
   person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the
   system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.^[109]

Congressional and executive enforcement

   As its first enforcement legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights
   Act of 1866, which guaranteed black Americans citizenship and equal
   protection of the law, though not the right to vote. The Amendment was
   also used as authorization for several Freedmen's Bureau bills.
   President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but a Congressional
   supermajoirty overrode his veto to pass the Civil Rights Act and the
   Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.^[110]^[111]

   Proponents of the Act including Trumbull and Wilson argued that Section
   2 of the Thirteenth Amendment (enforcement power) authorized the
   federal government to legislate civil rights for the States. Others
   disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from
   slavery.^[112] Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that
   future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress
   and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the
   Fourteenth Amendment (1868), which defined citizenship and mandated
   equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870),
   which banned racial voting restrictions.^[113]

   The Freedmen's Bureau enforced the Amendment locally, providing a
   degree of support for people subject to the Black Codes.^[114]
   (Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal
   basis to operate in Kentucky.)^[115] The Civil Rights Act circumvented
   racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal
   courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of
   1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy,
   were also part of the effort to end slave conditions for Southern
   blacks.^[116] However, the effect of these laws waned as political will
   diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South,
   particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in
   exchange for a Republican presidency.^[117]

Peonage law

   With the Peonage Act of 1867, Congress abolished “the holding of any
   person to service or labor under the system known as peonage”,^[118]
   specifically banning “the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of
   any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or
   otherwise.”^[119]

   In 1939, the Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section,
   which focused primarily on First Amendment and labor rights.^[120] The
   increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II
   brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary
   servitude, abroad and at home.^[121] The U.S. sought to counter foreign
   propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting
   the Southern peonage system.^[122] Under the leadership of Attorney
   General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the
   constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era as
   the basis for its actions.^[123]

   In 1947, the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping
   domestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery. The court
   found that Jones “was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant;
   that she was one who had no freedom of action and whose person and
   services were wholly under the control of defendant and who was in a
   state of enforced compulsory service to the defendant.”^[124] The
   Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention during this period,
   but from Brown v. Board (1954) until Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.
   (1968) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment.^[125]

Human trafficking

   Victims of human trafficking and other conditions of forced labor are
   commonly coerced by threat of legal actions to their detriment. Victims
   of forced labor and trafficking are protected by Title 18 of the U.S.
   Code.^[126]
     * Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 – Conspiracy Against Rights:

     Conspiracy to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person's
     rights or privileges secured by the Constitution or the laws of the
     United States^[127]

     * Title 18, U.S.C., Section 242 – Deprivation of Rights Under Color
       of Law:

     It is a crime for any person acting under color of law (federal,
     state or local officials who enforce statutes, ordinances,
     regulations, or customs) to willfully deprive or cause to be
     deprived the rights, privileges, or immunities of any person secured
     or protected by the Constitution and laws of the U.S. This includes
     willfully subjecting or causing to be subjected any person to
     different punishments, pains, or penalties, than those prescribed
     for punishment of citizens on account of such person being an alien
     or by reason of his/her color or race.^[128]

Department of Justice definitions

   Peonage^[129]
          Refers to a person in "debt servitude," or involuntary servitude
          tied to the payment of a debt. Compulsion to servitude includes
          the use of force, the threat of force, or the threat of legal
          coercion to compel a person to work.

   Involuntary servitude^[130]
          Refers to a person held by actual force, threats of force, or
          threats of legal coercion in a condition of slavery – compulsory
          service or labor against his or her will. This includes the
          condition in which people are compelled to work by a "climate of
          fear" evoked by the use of force, the threat of force, or the
          threat of legal coercion (i.e., suffer legal consequences unless
          compliant with demands made upon them) which is sufficient to
          compel service. In Bailey v. Alabama (1911), the U.S. Supreme
          Court ruled that peonage laws violated the amendment's ban on
          involuntary servitude.

          Requiring specific performance as a remedy for breach of
          personal services contracts has been viewed as a form of
          involuntary servitude by some scholars and courts, though other
          jurisdictions and scholars have rejected this argument; it is a
          popular rule in academia and many local jurisdictions, but has
          never been upheld by higher courts.^[131]

   Forced labor^[132]
          Labor or service obtained by:

          + threats of serious harm or physical restraint;
          + any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to
            believe he would suffer serious harm or physical restraint if
            he did not perform such labor or services:
          + the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process.

Judicial interpretation

   In contrast to the other "Reconstruction Amendments", the Thirteenth
   Amendment was rarely cited in later case law. As historian Amy Dru
   Stanley summarizes, "beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down
   debt peonage, ﬂagrant involuntary servitude, and some instances of
   race-based violence and discrimination, the Thirteenth Amendment has
   never been a potent source of rights claims".^[133]^[134]

Black slaves and their descendants

   U. S. v. Rhodes (1866),^[135] one of the first Thirteenth Amendment
   cases, tested the Constitutionality of provisions in the Civil Rights
   Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky
   law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement
   which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United
   States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person
   accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in
   federal court; the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option
   unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the
   Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that
   without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act,
   slavery would not truly be abolished.^[136]^[137] With In Re Turner
   (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth
   Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former
   master.^[138]

   In Blyew v. U.S., (1872)^[139] the Supreme Court heard another Civil
   Rights Act case relating to federal courts in Kentucky. John Bylew and
   George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a black family, the
   Fosters. Bylew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard
   Foster and hit him twice in the head with an ax. Bylew and Kennard
   killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind
   grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two
   young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to
   testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by
   the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When
   the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster
   children did not have standing in federal courts because only living
   people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts
   effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal
   remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented,
   maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth
   Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.^[140]

   Though based on a technicality, the Blyew case set a precedent in state
   and federal courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth
   Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the
   Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly
   of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court
   ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to
   exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the
   Enforcement Act of 1870.^[116]
   John Marshall Harlan became known as "The Great Dissenter" for his
   minority opinions favoring powerful Thirteenth and Fourteenth
   Amendments.^[141]

   The Thirteenth Amendment was not solely a ban on chattel slavery, but
   also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social
   deprivations.^[142] As the U.S. Supreme Court explicated in the
   Slaughter-House Cases (1873) with respect to the Fourteenth and
   Fifteenth Amendment and the Thirteenth Amendment in special:
   “ Undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress
     which proposed the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of
     slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie
     labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race
     within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it
     void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly
     and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that
     protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of
     African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood
     is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of
     these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have
     said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were
     designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the
     Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as
     far as constitutional law can accomplish it.^[143]                     ”

   In the Civil Rights Cases (1883),^[144] the Supreme Court reviewed five
   consolidated cases dealing with the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which
   outlawed racial discrimination at "inns, public conveyances on land or
   water, theaters, and other places of public amusement". The Court ruled
   that the Thirteenth Amendment did not ban most forms of racial
   discrimination by non-government actors.^[145] In the majority
   decision, Bradley wrote (again in non-binding dicta) that the
   Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to attack "badges and incidents
   of slavery". However, he distinguished between "fundamental rights" of
   citizenship, protected by the Thirteenth Amendment, and the "social
   rights of men and races in the community".^[146] The majority opinion
   held that "it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to
   make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit
   to make as to guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will
   take into his coach or cab or car; or admit to his concert or theatre,
   or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business."^[147] In his
   solitary dissent, John Marshall Harlan (a Kentucky lawyer who changed
   his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist
   violence) argued that "such discrimination practiced by corporations
   and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public
   functions is a badge of servitude, the imposition of which congress may
   prevent under its power."^[148]

   The Court in the Civil Rights Cases also held that appropriate
   legislation under the amendment could go beyond nullifying state laws
   establishing or upholding slavery, because the amendment "has a reflex
   character also, establishing and decreeing universal civil and
   political freedom throughout the United States" and thus Congress was
   empowered "to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all
   badges and incidents of slavery in the United States."^[144] The Court
   stated about the scope the amendment:
   “ This amendment, as well as the Fourteenth, is undoubtedly
     self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms
     are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own
     unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established
     universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to
     meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and
     to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or
     spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its
     character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws
     establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that
     slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the
     United States.^[144]                                                  ”

   Attorneys in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)^[149] argued that racial
   segregation involved "observances of a servile character coincident
   with the incidents of slavery", in violation of the Thirteenth
   Amendment. In their brief to the Supreme Court, Plessy's lawyers wrote
   that "distinction of race and caste" was inherently
   unconstitutional.^[150] The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning and
   upheld state laws enforcing segregation under the "separate but equal"
   doctrine. In the (7–1) majority decision, the Court found that "a
   statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and
   colored races—a distinction which is founded on the color of the two
   races and which must always exist so long as white men are
   distinguished from the other race by color—has no tendency to destroy
   the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of
   involuntary servitude."^[151] Harlan dissented, writing: "The thin
   disguise of 'equal' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches
   will not mislead any one, nor, atone for the wrong this day
   done."^[152]

   In Hodges v. United States (1906),^[153] the Court struck down a
   federal statute providing for the punishment of two or more people who
   "conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any citizen in the
   free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by
   the Constitution or laws of the United States". A group of white men in
   Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from
   performing their jobs at a lumber mill; the group was convicted by a
   federal grand jury. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal statute,
   which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty, was
   not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment. It held that "no mere
   personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the
   individual to a condition of slavery". Harlan dissented, maintaining
   his opinion that the Thirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond
   "physical restraint".^[154] Corrigan v. Buckley (1922) reaffirmed the
   interpretation from Hodges, finding that the amendment does not apply
   to restrictive covenants.

   Enforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous
   peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The
   Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was
   involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes
   described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the
   servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.^[155]

   In Bailey v. Alabama the U.S. Supreme Court again reaffirmed its
   holding that Thirteenth Amendment was not solely a ban on chattel
   slavery, but also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and
   social deprivations^[142] In addition to the aforesaid the Court also
   ruled on Congress enforcement power under the Thirteenth Amendment. The
   Court said:
   “ The plain intention [of the amendment] was to abolish slavery of
     whatever name and form and all its badges and incidents; to render
     impossible any state of bondage; to make labor free, by prohibiting
     that control by which the personal service of one man is disposed of or
     coerced for another's benefit, which is the essence of involuntary
     servitude. While the Amendment was self-executing, so far as its terms
     were applicable to any existing condition, Congress was authorized to
     secure its complete enforcement by appropriate legislation.^[156]      ”

Jones and beyond

   Legal histories cite Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. (1968) as a turning
   point of Thirteen Amendment jurisprudence.^[157]^[158] The Supreme
   Court confirmed in Jones that Congress may act “rationally” to prevent
   private actors from imposing "badges and incidents of servitude".^[157]
   The Joneses were a black couple in St. Louis County, Missouri who sued
   a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house. The Court
   held:

     Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to
     determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the
     authority to translate that determination into effective
     legislation. [...] this Court recognized long ago that, whatever
     else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery
     -- its "burdens and disabilities" -- included restraints upon "those
     fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely,
     the same right . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey
     property, as is enjoyed by white citizens." Civil Rights Cases, 109
     U. S. 3, 109 U. S. 22.^[159]

     Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the
     free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave
     system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a
     substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds
     men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the
     color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.

     Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment
     a promise of freedom—freedom to “go and come at pleasure” and to
     “buy and sell when they please”—would be left with “a mere paper
     guarantee” if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the
     hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the
     hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress
     is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the
     freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live
     wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a
     free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment
     made a promise the Nation cannot keep.^[160]

   The Court in Jones reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary
   society to the history of slavery in the United States.^[161]

   The Jones precedent has been used to justify Congressional action to
   protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking.^[162] The direct
   enforcement power found in the Thirteenth Amendment contrasts with that
   of the Fourteenth, which allows only responses to institutional
   discrimination of state actors.^[163]

Other cases of involuntary servitude

   The Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary
   servitude claims made by people not descended from black (African)
   slaves. In Robertson v. Baldwin (1897), a sailor challenged federal
   rules mandating the capture and return of deserters. The Court ruled
   that "the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine
   with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been
   treated as exceptional." In this case, as in numerous “badges and
   incidents” cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader
   Thirteenth Amendment protections.^[164]

   In Selective Draft Law Cases,^[165] the Supreme Court ruled that the
   military draft was not "involuntary servitude". In United States v.
   Kozminski,^[166] the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment
   did not prohibit compulsion of servitude through psychological
   coercion.^[167]^[168] Kozminski defined involuntary servitude for
   purposes of criminal prosecution as "a condition of servitude in which
   the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of
   physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of
   coercion through law or the legal process. This definition encompasses
   cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing
   him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal
   coercion."^[166]

   U.S. Courts of Appeals, in Immediato v. Rye Neck School District,
   Herndon v. Chapel Hill, and Steirer v. Bethlehem School District, have
   ruled that the use of community service as a high school graduation
   requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.^[169]

Prior proposed Thirteenth Amendments

   During the six decades following the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth
   Amendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by
   Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Neither has been
   ratified by the number of states necessary to become part of the
   Constitution. Commonly known as the Titles of Nobility Amendment and
   the Corwin Amendment, both are referred to as Article Thirteen, as was
   the successful Thirteenth Amendment, in the joint resolution passed by
   Congress.
     * The Titles of Nobility Amendment (pending before the states since
       May 1, 1810) would, if ratified, strip citizenship from any United
       States citizen who accepts a title of nobility or honor from a
       foreign country without the consent of Congress.^[170]
     * The Corwin Amendment (pending before the states since March 2,
       1861) would, if ratified, shield "domestic institutions" of the
       states (in 1861 this meant slavery) from the constitutional
       amendment process and from abolition or interference by
       Congress.^[171]^[172]

       depended upon the indebtedness of a worker, rather than an actual
       property right in a slave, as the means of compelling work. A
       prospective employer would offer a laborer a "loan" or "advance" on
       his wages, typically as a condition of employment, and then use the
       newly created debt to compel the worker to remain on the job for as
       long as the employer wished.”
   107. ^ ^a ^b Wolff, “The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global
       Economy” (2002), p. 982. “Not surprisingly, employers used peonage
       arrangements primarily in industries that involved hazardous
       working conditions and very low pay. While black workers were not
       the exclusive victims of peonage arrangements in America, they
       suffered under its yoke in vastly disproportionate numbers. Along
       with Jim Crow laws that segregated transportation and public
       facilities, these laws helped to restrict the movement of freed
       black workers and thereby keep them in a state of poverty and
       vulnerability.”
   108. ^ Wolff, “The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global
       Economy” (2002), p. 982. “Legally sanctioned peonage arrangements
       blossomed in the South following the Civil War and continued into
       the twentieth century. According to the Professor Jacqueline Jones,
       'perhaps as many as one-third of all [sharecropping farmers] in
       Alabama, Mississippi, and George were being held against their will
       in 1900.”
   109. ^ Wolff, “The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global
       Economy” (2002), p. 982. “It did not recognize a property right in
       a human being (a peon could not be sold in the manner of a slave);
       and the condition of peonage did not work 'corruption of blood' and
       travel to the children of the worker. Peonage, in short, was not
       chattel slavery. Yet the practice unquestionably reproduced many of
       the immediate practical realities of slavery—a vast underclass of
       laborers, held to their jobs by force of law and threat of
       imprisonment, with few if any opportunities for escape.”

       Freedmen's Bureau for help against these child abductions,
       particularly in those cases where children were taken from living
       parents. Jack Prince asked for help when a woman bound his maternal
       niece. Sally Hunter requested assistance to obtain the release of
       her two nieces. Bureau officials finally put an end to the system
       of indenture in 1867".

       section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to pass Reconstruction
       legislation, they would soon learn that President Johnson, using
       his veto power, would make increasingly more difficult the passage
       of any measure augmenting the power of the national government.
       Further, with time, even leading antislavery Republicans would
       become less adamant and more willing to reconcile with the South
       than protect the rights of the newly freed. This was clear by the
       time Horace Greely accepted the Democratic nomination for president
       in 1872 and even more when President Rutherford B. Hayes entered
       the Compromise of 1877, agreeing to withdraw federal troops from
       the South."

       significance in achieving genuine liberation. The Court did not
       revisit the amendment's meaning until 1968, during the heyday of
       the Civil Rights movement. In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer, the Court
       found that the Thirteenth Amendment not only ended unrecompensed,
