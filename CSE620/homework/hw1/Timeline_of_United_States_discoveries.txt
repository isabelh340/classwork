   Timeline of United States discoveries encompasses the breakthroughs of
   human thought and knowledge of new scientific findings, phenomena,
   places, things, and what was previously unknown to exist. From a
   historical stand point, the timeline below of United States discoveries
   dates from the 18th century to the 21st century, which have been
   achieved by discoverers who are either native-born or naturalized
   citizens of the United States.

   With an emphasis of discoveries in the fields of astronomy, physics,
   chemistry, medicine, biology, geology, paleontology, and archaeology,
   United States citizens acclaimed in their professions have contributed
   much. For example, the “Bone Wars,” beginning in 1877 and ending in
   1892, was an intense period of rivalry between two American
   paleontologists, Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, who
   initiated several expeditions throughout North America in the pursuit
   of discovering, identifying, and finding new species of dinosaur
   fossils. In total, their large efforts resulted in when 142 species of
   dinosaurs being discovered.^[1] With the founding of the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958, a vision and
   continued commitment by the United States of finding extraterrestrial
   and astronomical discoveries has helped the world to better understand
   our solar system and universe. As one example, in 2008, the Phoenix
   Mars Lander discovered the presence of frozen water on the planet Mars
   of which scientists such as Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona
   Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) had suspected before the mission
   confirmed its existence.^[2]

Eighteenth century[edit]

   1747 Charge conservation
     * In physics, charge conservation is the principle that electric
       charge can neither be created nor destroyed. The quantity of
       electric charge, the amount of positive charge minus the amount of
       negative charge in the universe, is always conserved. As part of
       his groundbreaking work in electricity, Benjamin Franklin around
       the year 1747 discovered the principle of charge conservation when
       he came to the conclusion that the two states of electricity,
       positive and negative, the charge is never created or destroyed but
       instead transferable from one place to another.^[3]

   1796 Johnston Atoll
     * Johnston Atoll, a territory of the United States, a Pacific Remote
       Islands Marine National Monument, and a part of the wider United
       States Minor Outlying Islands, is a 50-square-mile (130 km2) atoll
       in the North Pacific Ocean about 750 miles (1,400 kilometers) west
       of the U.S. state of Hawaii. There are four islands located on the
       coral reef platform, two natural islands, Johnston Island and Sand
       Island, which have been expanded by coral dredging, as well as
       North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina), an additional two
       artificial islands formed by coral dredging. The sovereignty of
       Johnston Atoll was disputed and claimed by the Kingdom of Hawaii
       beginning in 1858 until Hawaii itself was eventually annexed by the
       United States as the Hawaii Territory in 1898. Johnston Atoll is
       now administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife
       Service, an agency of the United States Department of Interior. In
       1796, Johnston Atoll was discovered accidentally by U.S. Captain
       Joseph Pierpoint when his ship, the American brig Sally, ran
       aground.^[4]

   1798 Tabuaeran
     * Tabuaeran, also known as Fanning Island or Fanning Atoll (both
       Gilbertese and English names are recognized) is one of the Line
       Islands located in the central Pacific Ocean. With a population of
       approximately 2,500, much of the island's economy relies upon the
       cruise industry. Formerly under British rule, Tabuaeran now is a
       part of the Republic of Kiribati. Tabuaeran was discovered on June
       11, 1798 by U.S. Captain Edmund Fanning, at 3 a.m., while on a
       voyage to China aboard his ship, Betsy.^[5]

   1798 Teraina
     * Teraina, also known as Washington Island, is an inhabited coral
       atoll located in the central Pacific Ocean that is 282 nautical
       miles (522 km) north of the equator, 75 miles (121 km) northwest of
       Tabuaeran, 238 miles (383 km) northwest of Christmas Island, and
       120 miles (190 km) southeast of the U.S. territory of Palmyra
       Atoll. Formerly under British rule, Teraina is now a part of the
       Republic of Kiribati. Obsolete names of Teraina are Prospect Island
       and New York Island. The island consists of nine Polynesian
       villages. Teraina was discovered by U.S. Captain Edmund Fanning, in
       the American ship Betsy, on June 12, 1798.^[6]

   1798 Palmyra Atoll
   Palmyra Atoll's North Beach.

   Palmyra Atoll, a territory of the United States, a Pacific Remote
   Islands Marine National Monument, and a part of the wider United States
   Minor Outlying Islands, is a 4.6 sq mi (12 km^2) atoll located in the
   North Pacific Ocean almost due south of the Hawaiian Islands, roughly
   halfway between the U.S. state of Hawaii and the U.S. territory of
   American Samoa. The atoll consists of an extensive reef, two shallow
   lagoons, and some 50 sand and reef-rock islets and bars covered with
   lush, tropical vegetation. The islets of the atoll are all connected,
   except Sand Island and the two Home Islets in the west and Barren
   Island in the east. The largest island is Cooper Island in the north,
   followed by Kaula Island in the south. Cooper Island is privately owned
   by The Nature Conservancy and managed as a nature reserve. The rest of
   the atoll is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and
   is directly administered by the Office of Insular Affairs, an agency of
   the United States Department of Interior. Palmyra Atoll's history is
   long and colorful. It was first sighted on June 14, 1798, by Captain
   Edmund Fanning and officially discovered in 1802 by Captain Sawle of
   the American ship Palmyra.^[7]

   1798 Kingman Reef
     * Kingman Reef, a territory of the United States, a Pacific Remote
       Islands Marine National Monument, and a part of the wider United
       States Minor Outlying Islands, is a largely submerged, uninhabited
       triangular shaped reef, 9.5 nautical miles (18 kilometers)
       east-west and 5 nautical miles (9 kilometers) north-south, located
       in the North Pacific Ocean, roughly half way between the Hawaiian
       Islands and the U.S. territory of American Samoa. It is the
       northernmost of the Northern Line Islands and lies 36 nautical
       miles (67 kilometers) northwest of the next closest island, the
       U.S. territory of Palmyra Atoll, and 930 nautical miles (1,720
       kilometers) south of Honolulu, Hawaii. Kingman Reef is now
       administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife
       Service, an agency of the United States Department of Interior.
       First known as "Dangerous Reef", Kingman Reef was discovered on
       June 14, 1798 by U.S. Captain Edmund Fanning.^[8]

Nineteenth century[edit]

   1821 South Orkney Islands
     * The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the Southern
       Ocean, about 375 miles (604 km) northeast of the tip of the
       Antarctic Peninsula. As part of the British Antarctic Territory,
       the islands have a total area of about 240 square miles (620 km^2).
       In December 1821, Captain Nathaniel B. Palmer as commander of the
       James Monroe, along with British sealer George Powell,
       co-discovered the South Orkney Islands.^[9]

   1822 Howland Island
     * Howland Island, a territory of the United States and a part of the
       United States Minor Outlying Islands, is an uninhabited coral
       island located just north of the equator in the central Pacific
       Ocean, about 1,700 nautical miles (3,100 km) southwest of Honolulu,
       Hawaii. The island lies almost halfway between the U. S state of
       Hawaii and Australia. Its nearest neighbor is Baker Island, 37
       nautical miles (68 kilometers) to the south. Now known as a
       National Wildlife Refuge, Howland Island is an insular area
       administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife
       Service. First known as "Worth Island", Howland Island as it later
       was named, was discovered by U.S. Captain George B. Worth aboard
       the whaler Oena in 1822.^[8]

   1825 Baker Island
     * Baker Island, a territory of the United States and a part of the
       United States Minor Outlying Islands, is an uninhabited atoll
       located just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean
       about 1,700 miles (3,100 kilometers) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii.
       The island lies almost halfway between the U.S. state of Hawaii and
       Australia. Its nearest neighbor is Howland Island, 37 nautical
       miles (68 kilometers) to the north. Now known as a National
       Wildlife Refuge, Baker Island is an insular area administered and
       managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. According
       to an article in Pacfici Magazine dated in 2000, Baker island was
       reportedly first sighted in 1825 by U.S. Captain Obed Starbuck in
       the ship Lopez. The newly discovered island was named New Nantucket
       (and also as Phoebe). It was in 1832 that U.S. Captain Michael
       Baker, after whom the island is now named, also came to the island
       aboard the whaler Gideon Howard.^[10]

   1831 Chloroform
     * Chloroform is a chemical compound in the trihalomethane family that
       does not undergo combustion in air, although it will burn when
       mixed with more flammable substances. Chloroform was first
       discovered in July 1831 by American physician Samuel Guthrie,
       independently a few months later by French chemist Eugène Soubeiran
       and then by German chemist Justus von Liebig.^[11]

   1858 Hadrosaurus foulki
   Plate XIII from Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States, showing
   various Hadrosaurus teeth (top) and vertebrae (bottom right). The teeth
   on the bottom left belonged to Astrodon.

   Hadrosaurus was a dubious genus of a hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived
   near what is now the coast of New Jersey in the late Cretaceous, around
   80 million years ago. It was likely bipedal for the purposes of
   running, but could use its forelegs to support itself while grazing.
   Like all hadrosaurids, Hadrosaurus was herbivorous. Its teeth suggest
   it ate twigs and leaves. In the summer of 1858 while vacationing in
   Haddonfield, New Jersey, William Parker Foulke discovered the world's
   first nearly-complete skeleton of any species of dinosaur, the
   Hadrosaurus (named by Joseph Leidy), an event that would rock the
   scientific world and forever change our view of natural history. To
   this day, Haddonfield, New Jersey is considered to be "ground zero" of
   dinosaur paleontology.^[12]

   1859 Midway Atoll

   Midway Atoll, better known as Midway Island or collectively as the
   Midway islands, is a territory of the United States and a part of the
   wider United States Minor Outlying Islands that is located in the North
   Pacific Ocean near the northwestern end of the Hawaiian Islands. As a
   2.4-square-mile (6.2 km²) atoll, Midway Atoll is one-third of the way
   between Honolulu, Hawaii and Tokyo, Japan, approximately 140 nautical
   miles (259 kilometers) east of the International Date Line, about 2,800
   nautical miles (5,200 kilometers) west of San Francisco, California,
   and 2,200 nautical miles (4,100 kilometers) east of Tokyo, Japan.
   Midway Atoll consists of a ring-shaped barrier reef and several sand
   islets. The two significant pieces of land, Sand Island and Eastern
   Island, provide habitat for millions of seabirds. Because of the
   importance of marine and biological environment, Midway Atoll is an
   insular area known as the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge that is
   administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife
   Service, an agency of the United States Department of Interior. Midway
   Atoll is perhaps best known as the site of the Battle of Midway, fought
   in World War II on June 4–6, 1942 and the decisive turning point of the
   Pacific War when the United States Navy defeated an attack by the
   Empire of Japan. First known as "Middlebrooks Islands", Midway Atoll
   was discovered by U.S. Captain N.C. Brooks aboard his ship, Gambia, on
   July 8, 1859.^[8]^[13]

   1859 Petroleum jelly

   Petroleum jelly, petrolatum or soft paraffin is a semi-solid mixture of
   hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing
   properties. The raw material for petroleum jelly was discovered in 1859
   by Robert Chesebrough, a chemist from New York. In 1870, this product
   was branded as Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.^[14]

   1873 Chemical potential
     * The chemical potential, symbolized by μ, is a thermodynamic concept
       developed by the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs in his
       1873 paper A Method of Geometrical Representation of the
       Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces.
       Gibbs's work had an enormous impact on the development of modern
       physical chemistry.^[15]

   1875 Red Delicious
   Bushels of Red Delicious apples.

   The Red Delicious is a clone of apple cultigen, now comprising more
   than 50 cultivars. The Red Delicious apple was discovered in 1875 by
   Jesse Hiatt on his farm in Peru, Iowa. Believing that the seedling was
   nothing more than nuisance. After chopping down the tree three times,
   Hiatt decided to let the tree grow and eventually, it produced an
   unknown and new harvest of red apples. Hiatt would eventually sell the
   rights to this type of apple to the Stark Brothers Nurseries and
   Orchards who renamed it the Red Delicious.^[16]

   1877 Deimos

   Deimos is the smaller and outer of Mars’ two moons. It was discovered
   by Asaph Hall in 1877.^[17]

   1877 Phobos

   Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars' two small moons. It was
   discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877.^[18]

   1888 Cliff Palace
   Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado.

   The Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in North America. The
   structure built by the Ancient Pueblo Peoples is located in Mesa Verde
   National Park in their former homeland region. The cliff dwelling and
   park are in the southwestern corner of Colorado, in the Southwestern
   United States. The ancient ruins of Cliff Palace were co-discovered
   during a snowstorm in December 1888 by Richard Wetherill and Charlie
   Mason who were searching for stray cattle on Chapin Mesa.^[19]

   1889 Torosaurus

   Torosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late
   Cretaceous Period about 70 million years ago in what is now North
   America. Torosaurus had an enormous head that measured 8 feet (2.5 m)
   in length. Its skull is one of the largest know up to date, no other
   land animal has ever had a skull larger than Torosaurus. Torosaurus
   frill made up about one-half the total skull length. The first fossils
   of Torosaurus were discovered in 1889, in Wyoming by John Bell Hatcher.
   The American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh would later name the
   specimen Torosaurus latus, in recognition of the bull-like size of its
   skull and its large eyebrow horns. Ever since, the specimen has been in
   display at the Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut.^[20]

   1891 Thescelosaurus
   Charles Gilmore's reconstruction of Thescelosaurus in 1915.

   Thescelosaurus was a bipedal dinosaur with a sturdy build, small wide
   hands, and a long pointed snout from the Late Cretaceous Period,
   approximately 66 million years ago. As a herbivore, Thescelosaurus was
   not a tall dinosaur and probably browsed the ground selectively to find
   food. Its leg structure and proportionally heavy build suggests that it
   was not a fast runner like other dinosaurs. The first fossils of
   Thescelosaurus were co-discovered in 1891 by John Bell Hatcher and
   William H. Utterback, in Wyoming. However, this discovery remained
   stored until Charles W. Gilmore named the dinosaur in 1913.^[21]

   1892 Amalthea

   Amalthea is the third moon of Jupiter in order of distance from the
   planet. It was discovered on September 9, 1892, by Edward Emerson
   Barnard.^[22]

   1899 Phoebe
     * Phoebe is an irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by
       William Henry Pickering on March 17, 1899 from photographic plates
       that had been taken starting on August 16, 1898 at Arequipa, Peru
       by DeLisle Stewart.^[23]

Twentieth century[edit]

   1902 Tyrannosaurus
   The first sketch of a Tyrannosaurus skeleton in relation to a human
   skeleton ever published.

   Tyrannosaurus, a bipedal carnivore, is a genus of theropod dinosaur.
   The species Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly abbreviated to T. rex, is a
   fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western
   North America, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids.
   Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the last
   two million years of the Cretaceous Period, 67 to 66 million years ago.
   It was among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist prior to the
   Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event. In 1902, the first skeleton of
   Tyrannosaurus was discovered in Hell Creek, Montana by American
   paleontologist Barnum Brown. In 1908, Brown discovered a better
   preserved skeleton of Tyrannosaurus.^[24]

   1908 Seyfert galaxies
     * Seyfert galaxies are a class of galaxies with nuclei that produce
       spectral line emission from highly ionized gas, named after Carl
       Keenan Seyfert, the astronomer who first identified the class in
       1943 although they were first discovered by Edward A. Fath in 1908
       while he was at the Lick Observatory.^[25]

   1909 Burgess shale
   Charles Doolittle Walcott seen excavating the Burgess shale (near
   Field, British Columbia) with his wife Helen and son Sidney, in the
   quarry which now bears his name.

   The formation of Burgess shale — located in the Canadian Rockies of
   British Columbia — is one of the world's most celebrated fossil
   fields,^[26] and the best of its kind.^[27] It is famous for the
   exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils. It is 505
   million years (Middle Cambrian) old,^[28] one of the earliest
   soft-parts fossil beds. The rock unit is a black shale, and crops out
   at a number of localities near the town of Field, British Columbia in
   the Yoho National Park. The Burgess Shale was discovered by American
   palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909, towards the end of
   the season's fieldwork.^[29] He returned in 1910 with his sons,
   establishing a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The significance
   of soft-bodied preservation, and the range of organisms he recognized
   as new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year
   until 1924. At this point, aged 74, he had amassed over 65,000
   specimens. Describing the fossils was a vast task, pursued by Walcott
   until his death in 1927.^[29]

   1910 Propane
     * Propane is a three-carbon alkane, normally a gas, but compressible
       to a transportable liquid. It is derived from other petroleum
       products during oil or natural gas processing. It is commonly used
       as a fuel for engines, barbecues, portable stoves, and residential
       central heating. Propane was first identified as a volatile
       component in gasoline by Dr. Walter O. Snelling of the U.S. Bureau
       of Mines in 1910.^[30]

   1912 Golden Delicious
   Golden Delicious

   Golden Delicious is a large, yellow skinned cultivar of apple and very
   sweet to the taste. The original Golden Delicious tree is thought to
   have been discovered by Anderson Mullins on a hill near Porter Creek in
   Clay County, West Virginia. The Stark Brothers Nursery soon purchased
   the tree which spawned a leading cultivar in the United States and
   abroad. The Golden Delicious is the state fruit of West Virginia.^[31]

   1912 Smoking-cancer link
     * Dr. Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that lung cancer
       is related to smoking in 1912.^[32]

   1914 Sinope
     * Sinope is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter discovered by
       Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914.^[33]

   1915 Zener diodes
     * A Zener diode is a type of diode that permits current in the
       forward direction like a normal diode, but also in the reverse
       direction if the voltage is larger than the breakdown voltage known
       as "Zener knee voltage" or "Zener voltage". The device was named
       after Clarence Zener, who discovered this electrical property.

   1916 Barnard's Star
     * Barnard's Star is a very low-mass red dwarf star. At a distance of
       about 1.8 parsecs from the Solar System, or just under six
       light-years, Barnard's Star is the nearest known star in the
       constellation Ophiuchus, and the fourth-closest known individual
       star to the Sun, after the three components of the Alpha Centauri
       system. In 1916, Barnard's Star was discovered by American
       astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard, whom the star was named
       after.^[34]

   1916 Covalent bonding
     * The idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years to Gilbert
       N. Lewis, who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs
       between atoms. He introduced the so-called Lewis notation or
       electron dot notation or The Lewis Dot Structure in which valence
       electrons are represented as dots around the atomic symbols.^[35]

   1916 Heparin
     * Heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is widely used as an
       injectable anticoagulant and has the highest negative charge
       density of any known biological molecule. It can also be used to
       form an inner anticoagulant surface on various experimental and
       medical devices such as test tubes and renal dialysis machines. It
       was discovered by Jay McLean and William Henry Howell in 1916.^[36]

   1917 Vitamin A
     * Vitamin A, a bi-polar molecule formed with bi-polar covalent bonds
       between carbon and hydrogen, is linked to a family of similarly
       shaped molecules, the retinoids, which complete the remainder of
       the vitamin sequence. Its important part is the retinyl group,
       which can be found in several forms. In foods of animal origin, the
       major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate,
       which is converted to an alcohol in the small intestine. Vitamin A
       can also exist as an aldehyde, or as an acid. The discovery of
       vitamin A stemmed from research dating back to 1906, indicating
       that factors other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were
       necessary to keep cattle healthy. By 1917 one of these substances
       was independently discovered by Elmer McCollum at the University of
       Wisconsin–Madison,^[37] and Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne at
       Yale University.

   1923 Oviraptor
     * Oviraptor is a genus of small Mongolian theropod dinosaur that
       lived during the late Campanian stage about 75 million years ago.
       In 1923, Roy Chapman Andrews discovered the first and so far the
       only fossils of Oviraptor to ever be found at the Djadochta
       Formation in Inner Mongolia. This species of dinosaur was named and
       described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924.^[38]

   1924 Uncle Sam Diamond
     * Uncle Sam is a 40.23-carat white diamond, the largest diamond ever
       found in North America. Discovered in 1924 at the Crater of
       Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, the diamond was named after its
       discoverer, Wesley Oley Basham, who went by the nickname "Uncle
       Sam". Over the years, the Uncle Sam diamond was cut twice with the
       second cutting resulting in a 12.42-carat, emerald-cut gem.^[39]

   1925 Cepheid variables
     * Extragalactic astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned with
       objects outside the Milky Way Galaxy. In other words, it is the
       study of all astronomical objects which are not covered by galactic
       astronomy. It was started by Edwin Hubble when, in 1925, he
       discovered the existence of Cepheid variables in the Andromeda
       Galaxy. This discovery proved the existence of a galaxy over one
       million light-years away and thus extragalactic astronomy was
       created.^[40]^[41]

   1927 Electron diffraction
     * Electron diffraction is a collective scattering phenomenon with
       electrons being scattered by atoms in a regular crystal array. This
       can be understood in analogy to the Huygens principle for the
       diffraction of light. The incoming plane electron wave interacts
       with the atoms, and secondary waves are generated which interfere
       with each other. In 1927, two Americans named Clinton Davisson and
       Lester Germer had proven de Broglie's theory by discovering
       electron diffraction. This confirmation of the wavelike nature of
       an electron was discovered independently of Englishman George Paget
       Thomson.^[42]

   1928 Jones Diamond
     * The Jones Diamond is a bluish-white diamond weighing 34.48 carats
       (6.896 g), measuring 5/8 of an inch (15.8 mm) across, and
       possessing 12 diamond-shaped faces. It is considered to be the
       largest alluvial diamond from North America. The Jones Diamond was
       discovered by William P. "Punch" Jones and his father Grover while
       pitching horseshoes in 1928. They thought the stone was a piece of
       quartz which was common in the area. Keeping it in a cigar box in
       their tool shed for 14 years, the Jones's sent the gem to the
       geology department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1942 where
       they were informed that it was an alluvial diamond and not a quartz
       crystal. The diamond was then sent to the Smithsonian Institution
       in Washington D.C. for safekeeping until 1964, when it returned to
       the Jones family who kept it for another 20 years in a safe deposit
       box at their local bank in Virginia. In 1984, the Jones family
       finally sold the diamond at Sotheby's auction in New York City to a
       private collector of jewelry.^[43]

   1930 Pluto
   Clyde William Tombaugh, the American astronomer who discovered Pluto in
   1930.

   Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was
   considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its
   orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century but culminated at the
   start of the 20th century with a quest for Planet X. Percival Lowell
   proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in
   the orbits of the gas giants, particularly Uranus and Neptune,
   speculating that the gravity of a large unseen planet could have
   perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities. The
   discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 initially appeared to
   validate Lowell's hypothesis, and Pluto was considered the ninth planet
   until 2006.^[44]

   1931 Heavy hydrogen
     * Deuterium, also called heavy hydrogen, is a stable isotope of
       hydrogen with a natural abundance in the oceans of Earth of
       approximately one atom in 6500 of hydrogen (~154 PPM). It was
       discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey, who obtained a sample of
       hydrogen enriched in deuterium by distillation at low temperature
       and pressure.^[45]

   1931 Cosmic radio waves
     * Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial
       objects at radio frequencies. While trying to track down a source
       of electrical interference on telephone transmissions, Karl Guthe
       Jansky of Bell Telephone Laboratories discovered radio waves
       emanating from stars in outer space while investigating static that
       interfered with short wave transatlantic voice transmissions. Thus,
       the field of radio astronomy was born.^[46]

   1932 Positrons
     * The existence of positrons was first postulated in 1928 by Paul
       Dirac as a consequence of the Dirac equation and later discovered
       in 1932 by Carl D. Anderson, who gave the positron its name.^[47]

   1932 Homeostasis
     * Homeostasis is the property of a system, either open or closed,
       that regulates its internal environment so as to maintain a stable,
       constant condition. It was first proposed and coined by Walter
       Bradford Cannon, a former professor and chairman of the Department
       of Physiology at Harvard Medical School, and popularized it in his
       book The Wisdom of the Body.^[48]

   1933 Heavy water
     * Harold Urey discovered the isotope deuterium in 1931 and was later
       able to concentrate it in water. Urey's mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis
       isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in
       1933.^[49]

   1933 Polyvinylidene chloride
     * Polyvinylidene chloride is a polymer derived from vinylidene
       chloride. Its use can be found in water-based coating, the
       production of household items and industrial products. Ralph Wiley,
       a Dow Chemical lab worker, accidentally discovered polyvinylidene
       chloride in 1933.^[50]

   1936 Elliptical galaxies
     * An elliptical galaxy is a galaxy having an approximately elliptical
       shape and a smooth, nearly featureless brightness profile. They
       range in shape from nearly spherical to highly flattened and in
       size from hundreds of millions to over one trillion stars. It was
       originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work “The Realm of
       the Nebulae”^[51]

   1936 Muons
     * The muon is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with
       negative electric charge and a spin of 1⁄2. It was discovered by
       Carl D. Anderson and Seth Henry Neddermeyer in 1936 while they
       studied cosmic radiation.^[52]

   1936 Vitamin E
     * Tocopherol, a class of chemical compounds of which many have
       vitamin E activity, describes a series of organic compounds
       consisting of various methylated phenols. During feeding
       experiments with rats Herbert McLean Evans concluded in 1922 that
       besides vitamins B and C, an unknown vitamin existed. Although
       every other nutrition was present, the rats were not fertile. This
       condition could be changed by additional feeding with wheat germ.
       It took several years until 1936 when the substance was isolated
       from wheat germ and the formula C29H50O2 was determined by Herbert
       McLean Evans and K.S. Bishop. The structure was determined shortly
       thereafter in 1938.^[53]

   1936 Sodium thiopental
     * Sodium thiopental, better known as Sodium Pentothal, thiopentone
       sodium, or trapanal, is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate. It
       was discovered in the early 1936 by Ernest H. Volwiler and Donalee
       L. Tabern while working for Abbott Laboratories.^[54]

   1937 Niacin
     * Niacin, also known as vitamin B[3], is a water-soluble vitamin
       which prevents the deficiency disease pellagra. Niacin was
       extracted from livers by Conrad Elvehjem who later discovered the
       active ingredient, then referred to as the "pellagra-preventing
       factor" and the "anti-blacktongue factor."^[55]

   1937 Electron capture
     * Electron capture is a decay mode for isotopes that will occur when
       there are too many protons in the nucleus of an atom and
       insufficient energy to emit a positron. However, it continues to be
       a viable decay mode for radioactive isotopes that can decay by
       positron emission. K-electron capture was discovered by Luis
       Alvarez, who demonstrated it in 1937 and reported it in The
       Physical Review in April 1938.^[56]

   1938 Fluropolymers
     * A fluoropolymer is a fluorocarbon based polymer with multiple
       strong carbon–fluorine bonds. It is characterized by a high
       resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. Fluoropolymers were
       discovered in 1938 by Dr. Roy Plunkett when he accidentally
       polymerized tetrafluoroethylene to form
       polytetrafluoroethylene.^[57]

   1938 Animal echolocation
     * Echolocation, also called biosonar, is the biological sonar used by
       several animals such as dolphins, shrews, bats, and whales. The
       term was coined by Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos, who
       discovered its use by bats in 1938.^[58]

   1938 Carme
     * Carme is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was
       discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in
       California in July 1938.^[59]

   1938 Lysithea
     * Lysithea is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was
       discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938 at Mount Wilson
       Observatory.^[60]

   1940 Plutonium
     * Plutonium is a synthetic transuranic radioactive chemical element
       with the chemical symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide
       metal of silvery-white appearance that tarnishes when exposed to
       air, forming a dull coating when oxidized. Plutonium was
       co-discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg, A.C. Wahl, and J.W. Kennedy in
       1940.^[61]

   1942 Cyanoacrylate
     * Cyanoacrylates are a class of fast-acting adhesives and glues.
       Better known under the brand name "Super Glue," cyanoacrylates are
       used to assemble prototype electronics (see wire wrap), flying
       model aircraft, and as retention dressings for nuts and bolts.
       Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have
       also made them popular for use in simple woodworking, industrial
       binding, and appliance repair. The history of cyanoacrylates is one
       of accidental discovery when researchers under Dr. Harry Coover
       conducted experiments on adhesive chemicals in order to devise a
       clear plastic that could be used for precision gunsights for
       soldiers fighting in World War II. Failing in their
       experimentations, the practical usefulness of cyanoarcrylates did
       not materialize until much later when in 1951, Coover, who was then
       working at Eastman Kodak, came to the realization that the sticky
       adhesives had unique properties in that they required no heat or
       pressure to permanently bond two items together.^[62]^[63] In light
       of his invention of "Super Glue," Coover filed U.S. patent
       #2,768,109 on June 2, 1954 and it was issued to him on October 23,
       1956.^[64]

   1943 Streptomycin
     * Streptomycin is an antibiotic drug, the first of a class of drugs
       called aminoglycosides to be discovered, and was the first
       antibiotic remedy for tuberculosis. Streptomycin cannot be given
       orally as it must be administered by regular intramuscular
       injection. In 1943, Albert Schatz discovered Streptomycin.^[65]

   1944 Americium
     * Americium is a synthetic element that has the symbol Am and atomic
       number 95. A radioactive metallic element, americium is an actinide
       that is used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as
       well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Americium was
       co-discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph James, L. Morgan, and
       Albert Ghiorso during their work on the Manhattan Project in
       1944.^[66]

   1944 Curium
     * Curium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Cm and
       atomic number 96. A radioactive metallic transuranic element of the
       actinide series, curium is produced by bombarding plutonium with
       alpha particles (helium ions) and was named after Marie Curie and
       her husband Pierre Curie. Curium was co-discovered by Glenn T.
       Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso at the University of
       California at Bekeley in 1944.^[67]

   1945 Promethium
     * Promethium is a chemical element whose existence was first
       predicted by Bohuslav Brauner in 1902. It was first discovered and
       proven to exist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 1945 by
       Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin, and Charles D. Coryell by
       separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel
       irradiated in the Graphite Reactor.^[68]

   1946 Cloud seeding
     * Cloud seeding, a form of weather modification, is the attempt to
       change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds,
       by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud
       condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes
       within the cloud. The usual intent is to increase precipitation but
       hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports. The
       method's use has ranged from increasing precipitation in areas
       experiencing drought to removing radioactive particles from clouds.
       Cloud seeding was discovered by Vincent Schaefer in 1946.^[69]

   1948 Warfarin
     * Warfarin is an anticoagulant and pesticide. It was initially used
       as a pesticide but was later found to be effective and relatively
       safe for preventing thrombosis and embolism in many disorders and
       is currently the most widely used anticoagulant worldwide. It was
       discovered by Karl Paul Link and chemists at the University of
       Wisconsin–Madison.^[70]

   1948 Miranda
     * Miranda is the smallest and innermost of Uranus' five major moons.
       It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper on February 2, 1948 at McDonald
       Observatory.^[71]

   1948 Serotonin
     * Seratonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized in
       serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and
       enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract of animals
       including humans. It was isolated and named in 1948 by Maurice M.
       Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page of the Cleveland Clinic.^[72]

   1948 Tetracycline
     * Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum polyketide antibiotic indicated
       for use against many bacterial infections. It is commonly used to
       treat acne today, and played a historical role in stamping out
       cholera in the developed world. It was discovered by Benjamin Minge
       Duggar in 1948.^[73]

   1949 Nereid
     * Nereid, also known as Neptune II, is a moon of Neptune. Nereid was
       discovered on May 1, 1949 by Gerard Kuiper, who proposed the name
       in the report of his discovery. It is named after the Nereids,
       sea-nymphs of Greek mythology.

   1949 Berkelium
     * Berkelium is a synthetic element with the symbol Bk and atomic
       number 97. A radioactive metallic element in the actinide series,
       berkelium was first synthesized by bombarding americium with alpha
       particles (helium ions) and was named for the University of
       California at Berkeley. Berkelium was co-discovered in December
       1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Stanley G. Thompson, and Albert
       Ghiorso.^[74]

   1950 Californium
     * Californium is a radioactive metallic chemical element with the
       symbol Cf and atomic number 98. The element was first produced by
       bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium ions) at the
       University of California, Berkeley. It was the sixth transuranic
       element to be synthesized. Californium is one of the highest atomic
       mass elements to have been produced in weighable amounts. It is
       named for the U.S. state of California and the University of
       California. Californium was co-discovered by Stanley G. Thompson,
       Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1950.^[75]

   1951 Barium stars
     * Barium stars are G to K class giants, whose spectra indicate an
       overabundance of s-process elements by the presence of singly
       ionized barium, Ba II, at λ 455.4 nm. Barium stars also show
       enhanced spectral features of carbon, the bands of the molecules
       CH, CN and C2. The class was originally recognized and defined by
       William Bidelman and Philip Keenan.^[76]

   1951 Ananke
     * Ananke is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was
       discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in
       1951.^[77]

   1952 Polio vaccine
     * Vaccination works by priming the immune system with an 'immunogen'.
       Stimulating immune response, via use of an infectious agent, is
       known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio
       efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild
       poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients
       and the wider community. In 1952, Dr. Jonas Salk announced his
       discovery of a trial vaccine for Polio, or poliomyelitis. Salk's
       vaccine was composed of "killed" polio virus, which retained the
       ability to immunize without the risk of infecting the patient. In
       1954, Salk published his findings in the Journal of the American
       Medical Association, and nationwide testing was carried out. In
       1955, Salk's polio vaccine was made public.^[78]

   1952 Einsteinium
     * Einsteinium is a metallic synthetic element. On the periodic table,
       it is represented by the symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the
       seventh transuranic element, and an actinide. It was named in honor
       of Albert Einstein. Einsteinium was discovered by Albert Ghioirso
       in December 1952.^[79]

   1952 Rapid eye movement
     * Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a normal stage of sleep
       characterized by rapid movements of the eyes. REM sleep is
       classified into two categories: tonic and phasic. The phenomenon of
       REM sleep and its association with dreaming was discovered by
       Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman with assistance from
       William C. Dement, a medical student at the time, in 1952 during
       their tenures at the University of Chicago. Kleitman and
       Aserinsky's seminal article was published September 10, 1953.^[80]

   1953 DNA structure
   Watson-Crick DNA model of 1953, was reconstructed largely from its
   original pieces in 1973 and donated to the Science Museum in London.

   In 1953, based on X-ray diffraction images and the information that the
   bases were paired, James D. Watson along with Francis Crick
   co-discovered what is now widely accepted as the first accurate
   double-helix model of DNA structure.^[81]

   1955 Mendelevium
     * Mendelevium is a synthetic element with the symbol Md (formerly Mv)
       and the atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic
       element of the actinides, mendelevium is usually synthesized by
       bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles and was named after the
       Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who was responsible for the
       Periodic Table. Mendelevium was co-discovered by Albert Ghiorso,
       Bernard G. Harvey, Gregory R. Choppin, Stanley G. Thompson, and
       Glenn T. Seaborg in 1955.^[82]

   1955 Antiproton
     * The antiproton is the antiparticle of the proton. It was discovered
       by University of California, Berkeley physicists Thomas Ypsilantis,
       Emilio Segrè, Clyde Wiegand, and Owen Chamberlain in 1955.^[83]

   '1956 Porous silicon
     * Porous silicon (pSi) is a form of the chemical element silicon
       which has an introduced nanoporous holes in its microstructure,
       rendering a large surface to volume ratio in the order of
       500m2/cm3. It was first discovered by accident in 1956 at Bell Labs
       by Arthur Uhlir Jr. and Ingeborg Uhlir.^[84]

   1956 Kaon
     * A kaon is any one of a group of four mesons distinguished by the
       fact that they carry a quantum number called strangeness. It was
       first discovered by Leon Lederman and a group of scientists from
       Columbia University at Brookhaven National Laboratory.^[85]

   1956 Antineutron
     * The antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron. An antineutron
       has the same mass as a neutron, and no net electric charge.
       However, it is different from a neutron by being composed of
       anti-quarks, rather than quarks. It was discovered by Bruce Cork,
       William Wenzell, Glenn Lambertson, and Oreste Piccioni in
       1956.^[86]

   1956 Neutrino
     * Neutrinos are elementary particles that travel close to the speed
       of light, lack an electric charge, are able to pass through
       ordinary matter almost undisturbed, and are thus extremely
       difficult to detect. The neutrino was first postulated in 1930 by
       Wolfgang Pauli and later discovered in 1956 by Clyde Cowan,
       Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D.
       McGuire.^[87]

   1956 Nucleic acid hybridization
     * Hybridization, discovered by Alexander Rich and David R. Davies in
       1956, is the process of combining complementary, single-stranded
       nucleic acids into a single molecule.^[88]

   1958 Van Allen radiation belt
     * The Van Allen radiation belt is a torus of energy charged particles
       around Earth, held in place by Earth's magnetic field. On the sun
       side, it is compressed because of the solar wind and on the other
       side, it is elongated to around three earth radii. This creates a
       cavity called the Chapman Ferraro Cavity, in which the Van Allen
       radiation belts reside. The existence of the belt was confirmed by
       the Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 missions in early 1958, under Dr.
       James Van Allen at the University of Iowa.^[89]

   1959 Antiproton
     * The antiproton is the antiparticle of the proton. It was discovered
       in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicists Owen
       Chamberlain and Emilio Segrè for which they earned the 1959 Nobel
       Prize in Physics.^[90]

   1960 Seafloor spreading
     * Seafloor spreading occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic
       crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves
       away from the ridge. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental
       drift in the theory of plate tectonics. It was first proposed by
       Harry Hammond Hess and Robert S. Dietz in 1960.^[91]

   1961 Eta meson
     * The eta meson is a meson made of a mix of up quark, down quark,
       strange quark, quarks, and anti-quarks. It was discovered by a team
       at the University of California, Berkeley using the Bevatron.^[92]

   1964 Xi baryon
     * In particle physics, subatomic particle (Xi) is a name given to a
       range of baryons with one up or down quark and two heavier quarks.
       They are sometimes called the cascade particles because of their
       unstable state, they decay rapidly into lighter particles through a
       chain of decays. The first discovery of the Xi particle was at
       Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964.^[93]

   1964 Cosmic microwave background radiation
     * In cosmology, the cosmic microwave background radiation CMB is a
       form of electromagnetic radiation filling the universe. The CMB's
       discovery in 1964 by astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was
       the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, earning them a
       Nobel Prize in 1978.

   1964 Quark
     * A quark is a type of elementary particle found in nucleons and
       other subatomic particles. They are a major constituent of matter,
       along with leptons. The quark model was first postulated
       independently by physicist Murray Gell-Mann in 1964.^[94]

   1964 1930 Lucifer
     * 1930 Lucifer was a main-belt asteroid discovered at the United
       States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) in Flagstaff,
       Arizona on October 29, 1964 by American astronomer Elizabeth
       Roemer.^[95]

   1964 Hepatitis B virus
     * The Hepatitis B virus was discovered in 1965 by Baruch Blumberg,
       while working at the National Institutes of Health.^[96]

   1965 Aspartame
     * Aspartame is the name for an artificial, non-saccharide sweetener,
       aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester; that is, a methyl ester of
       the dipeptide of the amino acidsaspartic acid and phenylalanine.
       Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist
       working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized
       aspartame in the course of producing an anti-ulcer drug
       candidate.^[97]

   1965 Pulsating white dwarves
     * A pulsating white dwarf is a white dwarf star whose luminosity
       varies due to non-radial gravity wave pulsations within itself. The
       first pulsating white dwarf was discovered by Arlo U. Landolt when
       he observed in 1965 and 1966 that the luminosity of HL Tau 76
       varied with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes.^[98]

   1968 Up quark
     * The up quark is a first-generation quark with a charge of +(2/3)e.
       The existence of up quarks was first postulated when Murray
       Gell-Mann and George Zweig developed the quark model in 1964, and
       the first evidence for them was found in deep inelastic scattering
       experiments in 1968.^[99]

   1968 Down quark
     * The down quark is a first-generation quark with a charge of
       −^1⁄[3]. It is the second-lightest of all the six of quarks, the
       lightest being the up quark. Down quarks are most commonly found in
       nucleons. Its protons contains one down quark and two up quarks,
       while neutrons contain two down quarks and one up quark. Down
       quarks were theorized by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig when
       they discovered the quark model in 1968.^[100]

   1969 Mosher's acid
     * Mosher's acid, or α-methoxytrifluorophenylacetic acid, discovered
       by Harry S. Mosher in 1969, is a carboxylic acid which was first
       used as a chiral derivitizing agent.^[101]

   1969 Interstellar formaldehyde
     * Interstellar formaldehyde was first discovered in 1969 by Lewis
       Snyder, David Buhl, B. Zuckerman and Patrick Palmer using the
       National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Formaldehyde was detected by
       means of the 111 - 110 ground state rotational transition at
       4830 MHz.^[102]

   1970 Reverse transcriptase
     * In biochemistry, a reverse transcriptase, also known as
       RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, is a DNA polymerase enzyme that
       transcribes single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA. It was
       discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison,
       and independently by David Baltimore in 1970 at Massachusetts
       Institute of Technology.^[103]

   1972 Opiate receptors
     * Opioid receptors are a group of G protein-coupled receptors with
       opioids as ligands. The endogenous opioids are dynorphins,
       enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins, and nociceptin. The opioid
       receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs).
       Opiate receptors were discovered in 1972 by the American
       neuroscientist and pharmacologist named Candace Pert.^[104]

   1974 Australopithecus "Lucy"
   Full replica of Lucy's (Australopithecus afarensis) skeleton in the
   Museo Nacional de Antropología at Mexico City.

   Lucy is the common name of AL 288-1, several hundred pieces of bone
   representing about 40% of the skeleton of an individual
   Australopithecus afarensis. Lucy is reckoned to have lived 3.2 million
   years ago.^[105] This hominid was significant as the skeleton shows
   evidence of small skull capacity akin to that of apes and of bipedal
   upright walk akin to that of humans, providing further evidence that
   bipedalism preceded increase in brain size in human evolution. While
   working in collaboration with a joint French-British-American team,
   Lucy was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia on November 24, 1974, when
   American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, coaxed away from his
   paperwork by graduate student Tom Gray for a spur-of-the-moment survey,
   caught the glint of a white fossilized bone out of the corner of his
   eye, and recognized it as hominid. Later described as the first known
   member of Australopithecus afarensis. Dr. Johanson's girlfriend
   suggested she be named "Lucy" after the Beatles' song "Lucy in the Sky
   with Diamonds" which was played repeatedly during the night of the
   discovery.^[106]

   1974 J/ψ mesons
     * The J/ψ is a subatomic particle, a flavor-neutral meson consisting
       of a charm quark and a charm anti-quark. Mesons formed by a bound
       state of a charm quark and a charm anti-quark are generally known
       as "charmonium". Its discovery was made independently by two
       research groups, one at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
       headed by Burton Richter, and one at the Brookhaven National
       Laboratory, headed by Samuel Ting at Massachusetts Institute of
       Technology. They accidentally discovered they had found the same
       particle, and both announced their discoveries on November 11,
       1974.^[107]

   1974 Charm quark
     * The charm quark is a second-generation quark with an electric
       charge of +2⁄3 e. It is the third most massive of the quarks, at
       about 1.5 GeV/c2 and roughly one and a half times the mass of the
       proton. It was predicted in 1964 by Sheldon Lee Glashow and James
       Bjorken and first observed in November 1974, with the simultaneous
       discovery of the J/ψ|J/ψ meson charm particle at Stanford Linear
       Accererator Center by a group led by Burton Richter and at
       Brookhaven National Laboratory by a group led by Samuel C. C.
       Ting.^[108]

   1974 Binary pulsars
     * A binary pulsar is a pulsar with a binary companion, often another
       pulsar, white dwarf or neutron star. The first binary pulsar, PSR
       1913+16 or the "Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar" was discovered in 1974
       at Arecibo by Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. and Russell Hulse, for
       which they won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.^[109]

   1974 Leda
     * Leda is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was
       discovered by Charles T. Kowal at the Palomar Observatory on
       September 14, 1974.^[110]

   1974 Seaborgium
     * Seaborgium is a chemical element with the symbol Sg and atomic
       number 106. Seaborgium is a synthetic element whose most stable
       isotope 271Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minutes. Chemistry experiments
       with seaborgium have firmly placed it in group 6 as a heavier
       homologue to tungsten. Seaborgium was independently discovered by
       groups at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence
       Berkeley National Laboratory in 1974, and was named in honor of the
       American chemist Glenn T. Seaborg.^[111]

   1975 1983 Bok
     * 1983 Bok is a minor planet discovered on June 9, 1975 by American
       astronomer Elizabeth Roemer at Kitt Peak National Observatory in
       Arizona. As a minor planet, 1983 Bok was named in honor of Bart J.
       and Priscilla Fairfield Bok.^[112]

   1975 Themisto
     * Themisto is a small prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was
       discovered by Charles T. Kowal and Elizabeth Roemer in 1975.^[113]

   1975 Amarillo Starlight
     * The Amarillo Starlight is a 16.37-carat white diamond that was
       discovered in 1975 by W. W. Johnson of Amarillo, Texas while
       vacationing at the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. The
       Amarillo Starlight was later cut into a 7.54-carat marquise
       shape.^[39]

   1976 D mesons
     * D mesons are the lightest particle containing charm quarks. They
       are often studied to gain knowledge on the weak interaction. Since
       the D meson is the lightest meson containing a charm quark, it must
       change the charm quark into another quark to decay. D mesons were
       discovered in 1976 during the Mark I experiments at the Stanford
       Linear Accelerator Center.

   1976 Hepatitis B virus vaccine
     * After Baruch Samuel Blumberg discovered the Hepatitis B virus in
       1964, he later developed a diagnostic test and vaccine for the
       Hepatitis B virus in 1976.^[96]

   1977 Tau lepton
     * The tau lepton is a negatively charged elementary particle with a
       lifetime of 2.9×10−13 s and a mass of 1,777 MeV/c2. It was detected
       in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis
       Perl with his colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley National
       Laboratory.^[114]

   1977 Rings of Uranus
   A long-exposure, high phase angle (172.5°) Voyager 2 image of Uranus'
   inner rings. In forward-scattered light, dust bands not visible in
   other images can be seen, as well as the recognized rings.

   The planet Uranus has a system of rings intermediate in complexity
   between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems
   around Jupiter and Neptune. The rings of Uranus were discovered on
   March 10, 1977, by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Douglas J.
   Mink. More than 200 years ago, William Herschel also reported observing
   rings, but modern astronomers are skeptical that he could actually have
   noticed them, as they are very dark and faint.^[115]

   1977 Upsilon mesons
     * The upsilon meson is a flavorless meson formed from a bottom quark
       and its antiparticle. It was discovered by the E288 collaboration,
       headed by Leon Lederman,^[116] at Fermilab in 1977, and was the
       first particle containing a bottom quark to be discovered because
       it is the lightest that can be produced without additional massive
       particles. It has a mean lifetime of 1.21×10^−20 second and a mass
       about 10 GeV.

   1977 Bottom quark
     * The bottom quark is a third-generation quark with a charge of
       −1⁄3e. The bottom quark was discovered by the E288 experiment at
       Fermilab in 1977 when collisions produced bottomonium.^[117]

   1978 Restriction endonucleases
     * A restriction enzyme is an enzyme that cuts double-stranded or
       single stranded DNA at specific recognition nucleotide sequences
       known as restriction sites. Such enzymes, found in bacteria and
       archaea, are thought to have evolved to provide a defense mechanism
       against invading viruses. Inside a bacterial host, the restriction
       enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called
       restriction; host DNA is methylated by a modification enzyme to
       protect it from the restriction enzyme’s activity. The Nobel Prize
       in Medicine was awarded, in 1978, to Daniel Nathans, Werner Arber,
       and Hamilton O. Smith for the discovery of restriction
       endonucleases.^[118]

   1978 Charon
     * Charon, discovered by James W. Christy on June 22, 1978 while
       working at the United States Naval Observatory, is the largest moon
       of the dwarf planet Pluto.^[119]

   1979 Metis
     * Metis is the innermost moon of Jupiter. It was discovered in 1979
       by Stephen Synnott in images taken by Voyager 1.^[120]

   1979 Thebe
     * Thebe is the fourth of Jupiter's moons by distance from the planet.
       It was discovered by Stephen Synnott in images from the Voyager 1
       space probe taken on March 5, 1979 while orbiting around
       Jupiter.^[121]

   1979 Rings of Jupiter
     * The planet Jupiter has a system of rings, known as the rings of
       Jupiter or the Jovian ring system. It was the third ring system to
       be discovered in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus
       and was first observed in 1979 by the Voyager 1 space probe.^[122]

   1980 Oncogene
     * An oncogene is a gene that is mutated or expressed at high levels,
       and thus helps turn a normal cell into a tumor cell. In the late
       1970s, Robert Weinberg and his team of researchers began the search
       for a human oncogene. Using gene transfer techniques, researchers
       in his lab inserted DNA from human bladder tumor cells into normal
       animal cells. When the animal cells turned cancerous, Dr.
       Weinberg's associates began inserting smaller pieces of DNA into
       the normal cell. By 1980, they found a single fragment that turned
       the normal cell cancerous. This gene was found to belong to a
       sub-family of related genes, called ras, that was later discovered
       to play a role in causing bladder, lung, and colon cancer in both
       rats and humans. More results emerged in 1982 when Dr. Weinberg's
       laboratory discovered that a single, subtle genetic glitch in this
       oncogene topples the delicate balance between a bladder cell's
       normal and cancerous states.^[123]

   1980 Pandora
     * Pandora is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980
       from photos taken by Voyager 1, and was provisionally designated
       S/1980 S 26.^[124]

   1980 Prometheus
     * Prometheus is an inner satellite of Saturn that was discovered in
       1980 from photos taken by Voyager 1. It was provisionally
       designated S/1980 S 27.^[125]

   1980 Atlas
     * Atlas is a moon of Saturn that was discovered by Richard Terrile in
       1980 from Voyager photos and was designated S/1980 S 28.^[126]

   1981 Larissa
     * Larissa, also known as Neptune VII, is the fifth closest inner
       satellite of Neptune. It was first discovered by Harold J.
       Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky, and David J.
       Tholen based on fortuitous ground-based stellar occultation
       observations on May 24, 1981, and given the temporary designation
       S/1981 N 1, being announced on May 29, 1981.^[127]

   1983 Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
     * Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, also known as Pneumovax, is a
       vaccine used to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae infections such as
       pneumonia and septicaemia. It was discovered by American scientists
       at Merck & Co. in 1983.^[128]

   1984 Whydah wreckage
   Location of Whydah Gally which sank in 1717, near Cape Cod. The red X
   marks the spot.

   First launched in 1715 from London, England, the Whydah was a
   three-masted ship of galley-style design measuring 105 feet (32 m) in
   length, rated at 300 tons burden, and could travel at speeds up to
   14.95 mph (24.06 km/h). Christened Whydah after the West African slave
   trading kingdom of Ouidah, the vessel was configured as a heavily-armed
   trading and transport ship for use in the Atlantic slave trade,
   carrying goods from England to exchange for slaves in West Africa. It
   would then travel to the Caribbean to trade the slaves for precious
   metals, sugar, indigo, and medicinal ingredients, which would then be
   transported back to England. Captained by the English pirate "Black
   Sam" Bellamy, the Whydah, on April 26, 1717, sailed into a violent
   storm dangerously close to Cape Cod and was eventually driven onto the
   shoals at Wellfleet, Massachusetts. At midnight she hit a sandbar in 16
   feet (4.9 m) of water some 500 feet (150 m) from the coast of what is
   now Marconi Beach. Pummelled by 70-mile (110 km)-an-hour winds and 30
   to 40-foot (12 m) waves, the main mast snapped, pulling the ship into
   some 30 feet (9.1 m) of water where she violently capsized, taking
   Bellamy, all but two of his 145 men, and over 4.5 tons of gold, silver
   and jewels with it. After years of exhaustive searching, it was in 1984
   that world headlines were made when American archeological explorer
   Barry Clifford found the only solidly-identified pirate shipwreck ever
   discovered, the Whydah. Two-hundred thousand artifacts and sunken
   treasures were discovered in the shipwreck as well.^[129]

   1985 Puck
     * Puck is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered in December
       1985 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.^[130]

   1985 RMS Titanic wreckage
   The bow of the wrecked RMS Titanic, photographed in June 2004

   The RMS Titanic was an Olympic class passenger liner owned by the White
   Star Line and was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast,
   in what is now Northern Ireland. At the time of her construction, she
   was the largest passenger steamship in the world. Shortly before
   midnight on April 14, 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage,
   Titanic struck an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later,
   early on April 15, 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 of
   the 2,223 people on board, making it one of the deadliest peacetime
   maritime disasters in history. After nearly 74 years of being lost at
   sea on the bottom of the ocean floor, a joint Franco-American
   expedition led by American oceanographer Dr. Robert D. Ballard,
   discovered the wreckage of the RMS Titanic two miles (3 km) beneath the
   waves of the North Atlantic on September 1, 1985. Ballard was then
   forced to wait a year for weather conditions favorable to a manned
   mission to view the wreck at close range. In 1986, Ballard and his
   two-man crew, in the ALVIN submersible, made the first two and-a-half
   hour descent to the ocean floor to view the wreck first-hand. Over the
   next few days, they descended again and again and, using the Jason Jr.
   remote camera, recorded the first scenes of the ruined interior of the
   luxury liner.^[131]

   1986 Portia
     * Portia is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the
       images taken by Voyager 2 on January 3, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 1.^[130]

   1986 Juliet
     * Juliet is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the
       images taken by Voyager 2 on January 3, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 2.^[130]

   1986 Cressida
     * Cressida is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from
       the images taken by Voyager 2 on January 9, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 3.^[130]

   1986 Rosalind
     * Rosalind is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from
       the images taken by Voyager 2 on January 13, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 4.^[130]

   1986 Belinda
     * Belinda is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the
       images taken by Voyager 2 on January 13, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 5.^[130]

   1986 Desdemona
     * Desdemona is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from
       the images taken by Voyager 2 on January 13, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 6.^[130]

   1986 Cordelia
     * Cordelia is the inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from
       the images taken by Voyager 2 on January 20, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 7.^[130]

   1986 Ophelia
     * Ophelia is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the
       images taken by Voyager 2 on January 20, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 8.^[130]

   1986 Bianca
     * Bianca is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the
       images taken by Voyager 2 on January 23, 1986 and was given the
       temporary designation S/1986 U 9.^[130]

   1986 Tumor suppressor gene
     * A tumor suppressor gene, or anti-oncogene, is a gene that protects
       a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene is
       mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can
       progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic
       changes. In 1986, Robert Weinberg and a team of researchers working
       under his direction made a seminal discovery when they isolated Rb,
       or the retinoblastoma protein, the first known growth-suppressor
       gene.^[123]

   1989 Rings of Neptune
     * The rings of Neptune were discovered in 1989 by the Voyager 2
       spacecraft.^[132]

   1989 Proteus
     * Proteus, also known as Neptune VIII, is Neptune's largest inner
       satellite. Proteus was discovered from the images taken by Voyager
       2 during the Neptune flyby in 1989.^[133]

   1989 Despina
     * Despina, also known as Neptune V, is the third closest inner
       satellite of Neptune. Despina was discovered in late July 1989 from
       the images taken by the Voyager 2. It was given the temporary
       designation S/1989 N 3.^[134]

   1989 Galatea
     * Galatea, also known as Neptune VI, is the fourth closest inner
       satellite of Neptune. Galatea was discovered in late July 1989 from
       the images taken by the Voyager 2. It was given the temporary
       designation S/1989 N 4.^[134]

   1989 Thalassa
     * Thalassa, also known as Neptune IV, is the second inner satellite
       of Neptune. It was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989
       from the images taken by the Voyager 2. It was given the temporary
       designation S/1989 N 5.^[134]

   1989 Naiad
     * Naiad, also known as Neptune III, is the inner satellite of
       Neptune. It was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from
       the images taken by the Voyager 2. The last moon to be discovered
       during the flyby, it was designated S/1989 N 6.^[134]

   1989 Bismarck wreckage
     * The German battleship Bismarck was one of the most famous warships
       of World War II. As the lead ship of the Bismarck class, and named
       after the 19th century German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck,
       Bismarck displaced more than 50,000 tonnes fully loaded and was the
       largest warship then commissioned. Fleet Air Arm Swordfish biplanes
       launched from the carrier HMS Ark Royal torpedoed the ship and
       jammed her rudder, allowing Royal Navy units to catch up with her.
       In the ensuing battle on the morning of May 27, 1941, Bismarck was
       heavily attacked for almost two hours before sinking. After the
       discovery of the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in 1985, Dr. Robert D.
       Ballard's next goal was to find and film the wreck of the Bismarck.
       The search for the wreck began in July 1988, but his first
       expedition brought no success. A second expedition was mounted in
       late May 1989, and on June 8, 1989, after combing an area of some
       200 square miles (520 km^2), Ballard and his team finally found
       Bismarck's remains. The wreck lies in the bottom of the Atlantic
       Ocean some 600 miles (970 km) west of Brest, France at a depth of
       4,790 meters (15,700 ft).^[135]

   1990 Strawn-Wagner Diamond

   The Strawn-Wagner Diamond is a rare 3.03 carat diamond that is
   certified by the American Gem Society (AGS) as the world's most perfect
   diamond in terms of its cut and the highest grade possible, the "Triple
   Zero". The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was discovered in 1990 at the Crater
   of Diamonds State Park by Shirley Strawn of Murfreesboro,
   Arkansas.^[39]

   1993 Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
     * Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart and collided
       with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation
       of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. The
       collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted
       its role in reducing space debris in the inner solar system. Comet
       Shoemaker-Levy 9 was co-discovered photographically by the husband
       and wife scientific team of Carolyn S. Shoemaker and Eugene M.
       Shoemaker along with Canadian-born astronomer David H. Levy on
       March 24, 1993, using the 0.46-m (18-in.) Schmidt telescope at
       Palomar Observatory in California. Its discovery was a
       serendipitous product of their continuing search for "near-Earth
       objects", and the "9" indicates that it was the ninth short-period
       comet (period less than 200 years) discovered by this team.^[136]

   1995 Top quark
     * The top quark is the third-generation up-type quark with a charge
       of +(2/3)e. It was discovered in 1995 by the CDF and D0 experiments
       at Fermilab and is the most massive of known elementary
       particles.^[137]

   1995 Comet Hale-Bopp
     * Comet Hale-Bopp was arguably the most widely observed comet of the
       20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many decades and it
       was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months when it passed
       near planet Earth. Hale-Bopp was discovered by Alan Hale and Thomas
       Bopp on July 23, 1995 at a great distance from the Sun, raising
       expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time
       it passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of
       comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult, Hale-Bopp met
       or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1,
       1997.^[138]

   1998 USS Yorktown (CV-5) wreckage
     * The third USS Yorktown in the United States Navy, lead ship of the
       Yorktown class of aircraft carriers, was laid down on May 21, 1934
       at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and
       Drydock Company. Yorktown was launched on April 4, 1936, sponsored
       by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and commissioned at Norfolk,
       Virginia, on September 30, 1937 with Captain Ernest D. McWhorter in
       command. Yorktown was hit by air-launched torpedoes during the
       Battle of Midway on June 6, 1942. Hiryū, the sole surviving
       Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counter-attacking.
       The first wave of Japanese dive bombers badly damaged Yorktown with
       three bomb hits that snuffed out her boilers, immobilizing her, yet
       her damage control teams patched her up so effectively that the
       second wave's torpedo bombers mistook her for an undamaged carrier.
       Despite Japanese hopes to even the odds by eliminating two carriers
       with two strikes, Yorktown absorbed both Japanese attacks, the
       second wave mistakenly believing Yorktown had already been sunk and
       they were attacking USS Enterprise. After two torpedo hits,
       Yorktown lost power and developed a 26° list to port, which put her
       out of action and forced Admiral Frank J. Fletcher to move his
       command staff to the heavy cruiser Astoria. The second attempt at
       salvage, however, would never be made. Throughout the night of June
       6 and into the morning of June 7, Yorktown remained stubbornly
       afloat. By 0530 on June 7, however, the men in the ships nearby
       noted that the carrier's list was rapidly increasing to port. At
       0701, the ship turned over on her port side and sank in 3,000
       fathoms (5,500 m) of water, her battle flags still flying. On May
       19, 1998, the wreck of the Yorktown was discovered by Dr. Robert D.
       Ballard, American oceanographer and discoverer of the wreck of the
       RMS Titanic. The wreck of the Yorktown was found 3 miles (4.8 km)
       beneath the surface and was photographed.^[139]

   1998 Embryonic stem cell lines
     * A breakthrough in human embryonic stem cell research came in
       November 1998 when a group led by Dr. James Thomson^[140] at the
       University of Wisconsin–Madison first discovered a technique in
       order to isolate and grow cells which derived from human
       blastocysts, could one day lead to major medical advancements in
       organ transplantation as well as gene therapy and treatment of
       maladies such as paralysis, diabetes, cancer, and AIDS.

Twenty-first century[edit]

   2001 Interstellar vinyl alcohol
     * Between May and June 2001, astronomers A. J. Apponi and Barry
       Turner co-discovered vinyl alcohol in the molecular cloud
       Sagittarius B using the National Science Foundation's 12-meter
       radio telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory.^[141]

   2003 Sedna
     * 90377 Sedna is a trans-Neptunian object and a likely dwarf planet.
       For most of its orbit Sedna is farther from the Sun than any other
       known dwarf planet candidate. In 2003, Sedna was co-discovered by
       Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz using the
       Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory.^[142]

   2003 Psamathe
     * Psamathe, also known as Neptune X, is a retrograde irregular
       satellite of Neptune. Psamathe was co-discovered by Scott S.
       Sheppard and David C. Jewitt in 2003.^[143]

   2003 Mab
     * Mab is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was co-discovered by Mark
       R. Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space
       Telescope.^[144]

   2003 Perdita
     * Perdita is an inner satellite of Uranus. Perdita's discovery was
       complicated. The first photographs of Perdita were taken by the
       Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, but it was not recognized from the
       photographs for more than a decade. In 1999, the moon was noticed
       by Erich Karkoschka and reported. Because no further pictures could
       be taken to confirm its existence, it was officially demoted in
       2001. However, in 2003, pictures taken by the Hubble Space
       Telescope managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed
       to be, finally confirming its existence.^[145]

   2003 Cupid
     * Cupid is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was co-discovered by Mark
       R. Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space
       Telescope.^[146]

   2004 Orcus
     * 90482 Orcus is a large Kuiper Belt object (KBO) with a large
       companion and is likely a dwarf planet. Orcus was co-discovered by
       Chad Trujillo, Michael E. Brown, and David Rabinowitz in
       2004.^[147]

   2005 Makemake
     * Makemake, formally designated (136472) Makemake, is the
       third-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System and one of the
       two largest Kuiper belt objects (KBO). Its diameter is roughly
       three-quarters that of Pluto. Makemake has no known satellites,
       which makes it unique among the largest KBOs. Makemake was first
       co-discovered in March 2005 by American astronomers Michael E.
       Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar
       Observatory.^[148]

   2005 Eris
   Artist impression of Eris and Dysnomia. Eris is the main object,
   Dysnomia the small grey disk just above it. The flaring object top-left
   is the Sun.

   Eris, formal designation 136199 Eris, is the largest known dwarf planet
   in the Solar System and the ninth-largest body known to orbit the Sun
   directly. It is approximately 2,500 kilometres in diameter and 27% more
   massive than the dwarf planet Pluto. Eris was discovered in 2005 at W.
   M. Keck Observatory by American astronomer Michael E. Brown.^[149]

   2005 Dysnomia

   Dysnomia, officially (136199) Eris I Dysnomia, is the only known moon
   of the dwarf planet Eris. In conjunction of finding Eris, American
   astronomer Michael E. Brown discovered Eris' satellite, Dysnomia, at W.
   M. Keck Observatory in 2005.^[150]

   2005 Hydra

   Hydra is the outer-most natural satellite of Pluto. It was discovered
   along with Nix in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope's Pluto
   Companion Search Team, which is composed of Hal A. Weaver, Alan Stern,
   Max J. Mutchler, Andrew J. Steffl, Marc W. Buie, William J. Merline,
   John R. Spencer, Eliot F. Young, and Leslie A. Young.^[151]

   2005 Nix

   Nix is a natural satellite of Pluto. It was discovered along with Hydra
   in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope's Pluto Companion Search
   Team, composed of Hal A. Weaver, Alan Stern, Max J. Mutchler, Andrew J.
   Steffl, Marc W. Buie, William J. Merline, John R. Spencer, Eliot F.
   Young, and Leslie A. Young.^[151]

   2005 KV63 at the Valley of the Kings
     * KV63 is the most recently opened chamber in Egypt's Valley of the
       Kings pharaonic necropolis. Initially believed to be a royal tomb,
       it is now believed to have been an ancient storage chamber for the
       mummification process. The 2005 discovery of KV63, located about 50
       feet (15 m) away from King Tut's tomb, is credited to American
       Egyptologist Dr. Otto Schaden and his team from the University of
       Memphis.^[152]

   2007 Human genome and variation mapping
     * The human genome is the genome of Homo sapiens, which is stored on
       23 chromosome pairs. Whereas a genome sequence lists the order of
       every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks.
       A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in
       navigating around the genome. While working at the National
       Institute of Health, Craig Venter discovered a technique for
       rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell, and began
       to use it to identify human brain genes.^[153] The short cDNA
       sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed
       sequence tags. Through his scientific research of bringing the
       world one step closer to personalized medicine, Craig Venter was
       listed on Time Magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most
       influential people in the world.

   2007 Di-positronium
     * The di-positronium is a molecule consisting of two atoms of
       positronium. It was predicted to exist in 1946 by John Archibald
       Wheeler and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not
       observed until 2007 in an experiment done by David Cassidy and
       Allen Mills at the University of California, Riverside.^[154]
