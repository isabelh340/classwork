   Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States is a three volume
   work written by Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Joseph Story and
   published in 1833. In these Commentaries, Story defends the power of
   the national government and economic liberty. "My object will be" Story
   wrote, "sufficiently attained, if I shall have succeeded in bringing
   before the reader the true view of its powers, maintained by its
   founders and friends, and confirmed and illustrated by the actual
   practice of the government."^[1]

Dedication to John Marshall[edit]

   Story dedicates his commentaries to his friend and fellow Justice,
   Chief Justice John Marshall: "When, indeed, I look back upon your
   judicial labors during a period of thirty-two years, it is difficult to
   suppress astonishment at their extent and variety, and at the exact
   learning, the profound reasoning, and the solid principles which they
   everywhere display. Other judges have attained an elevated reputation
   by similar labors, in a single department of jurisprudence. But in one
   department, (it need scarcely be said that I allude to that of
   constitutional law,) the common consent of your countrymen has admitted
   you to stand without a rival.^[2]"

Preface[edit]

   In his preface Story writes "From two great sources, however, I have
   drawn by far the greatest part of my most valuable materials. These
   are, The Federalist, an incomparable commentary of three of the
   greatest statesmen of their age, and the extraordinary Judgments of Mr.
   Chief Justice Marshall upon constitutional law. The former have
   discussed the structure and organization of the national government, in
   all its departments, with admirable fulness and force. The latter has
   expounded the application and limits of its powers and functions with
   unrivalled profoundness and felicity. The Federalist could do little
   more than state the objects and general bearing of these powers and
   functions. The masterly reasoning of the Chief Justice has followed
   them out to their ultimate results and boundaries with a precision and
   clearness approaching, as near as may be, to mathematical
   demonstration."^[3]

   Story contrasts these commentaries to the writings of other
   commentators of the Constitution: The reader must not expect to find in
   these pages any novel views and novel constructions of the
   Constitution. I have not the ambition to be the author of any new plan
   of interpreting the theory of the Constitution, or of enlarging or
   narrowing its powers by ingenious subtilties and learned doubts.^[4]

Book I[edit]

   History of the Colonies

   Perhaps following the example of Marshall’s Life of Washington, Story
   begins with a general history of the American colonies. Interestingly
   Story has a chapter on Maine, but he does not have one on Vermont.

Book II[edit]

   History of the Revolution and the Confederation

   Story highlights the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation.

Book III[edit]

   In the first three chapters Story gives a short history of the origin
   and adoption of the Constitution, the objections to the Constitution,
   the nature of the Constitution - whether a compact between sovereign
   states or the supreme and national law of the United States. In Chapter
   IV, Story discourses on "who is the final judge, or interpreter, in
   Constitutional controversies." In Chapter V, Story gives his nineteen
   rules of interpretation of the Constitution.

   Chapters 6 through 43 deal with the all the provisions of the original
   Constitution of the United States.

   Chapter 25 deals with the constitutionality of a national bank. Chapter
   26 deals with the authority of Congress to make roads, canals, and
   other internal improvements.

   Chapter 44 deals with the Amendments to the Constitution.

   Chapter 45 contains Story’s concluding remarks. "Many reflections
   naturally crowd upon the mind at such a moment,-many grateful
   recollections of the past, and many anxious thoughts of the future. The
   past is secure. It is unalterable. The seal of eternity is upon it. The
   wisdom which it has displayed and the blessings which it has bestowed,
   cannot be obscured; neither can they be debased by human folly or human
   infirmity. The future is that which may well awaken the most earnest
   solicitude, both for the virtue and the permanence of our republic. The
   fate of other republics - their rise, their progress, their decline,
   and their fall - are written but too legibly on the pages of history,
   if indeed they were not continually before us in the startling
   fragments of their ruins. They have perished, and perished by their own
   hands. Prosperity has enervated them, corruption has debased them, and
   a venal populace has consummated their destruction."^[5]

   Justice Story added an appendix to the second volume of the 1833
   edition where he quotes President Andrew Jackson’s December 10, 1832
   Proclamation which deals with South Carolina’s Nullification Laws. This
   appendix appears at the end of the first volume of the second, third,
   fourth and fifth editions.

   To the Fourth Edition, published in 1873 by Little, Brown & Co, Thomas
   M. Cooley added three chapters dealing with the emancipation of the
   slaves, the Fourteenth Amendment and impartial suffrage.

Abridgments[edit]

   Story published an abridgement of his Commentaries on the Constitution
   of the United States "for the Use of Colleges and High Schools." In A
   catalogue of law books, published and for sale by Charles C. Little and
   James Brown (1846) a copy of this abridgement costs $3.00^[6] Story's
   Abridgment may well have been even more influential than his three
   volume work, because the Abridgment saw a much larger audience...The
   Abridgment was required reading at Harvard and in other academic
   sttings.^[8]

   Story published The Constitutional Class Book: being a brief exposition
   of the Constitution of the United States. Boston: Hilliard, Gray and
   Company, 1834.

   A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution, published at Boston, by
   Marsh, Capen, Lyon and Webb in 1840. Thomas Webb published an edition
   in 1842, and Harpers published many reprints starting in 1847.

Reception and enduring reputation[edit]

   In correspondence Chancellor James Kent wrote to Story on June 19,
   1833: I have just now risen from the completion of that duty, and I owe
   it to you and to myself to say, that I have been delighted and
   instructed from the beginning to the end of the work. It is a most
   profound, learned, acute, and excellent production, distinguished for
   its accuracy, fulness, and judgment. Every topic is discussed in a
   masterly manner. It is complete and perfect throughout, and carries the
   head and heart captive through every page. It is written with admirable
   beauty and elegance of style, and under the glow and fervor of
   patriotism, eloquence, and truth.

   Chief Justice John Marshall wrote to Story on July 31, 1833: I have
   finished reading your great work, and wish it could be read by every
   statesman, and every would-be statesman in the United States. It is a
   comprehensive and an accurate commentary on our Constitution, formed in
   the spirit of the original text.

   Professor R. Mohl, of Tübingen, speaking of it in the Kritische
   Zeitschrift, says, - We have in this work, as perfect and excellent a
   Commentary on the North American Public Law, as can be produced by deep
   and profound reflection, acute logic, extensive knowledge of the
   national condition and writings, and just political views. Professor
   Story, by his able and diligent labors, has, without doubt, done a
   great service, not only to his countrymen, but also, and in a still
   higher degree, to the European publicists, among whom his name will
   receive an honorable fame, as readily awarded as it will be enduring!

   Professor Greenleaf, speaking of these Commentaries, says, - This great
   work, . . . admirable alike for its depth of research, its spirited
   illustrations, and its treasures of political wisdom, has accomplished
   all in this department which the friends of constitutional law and
   liberty could desire!^[9]

   Reviews in the press were laudatory, especially the reviews in American
   Quarterly Review, The American Jurist, The American Monthly Review, and
   the North American Review.^[10]

   Thomas M. Cooley in his prefatory essay to his edition of William
   Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England wrote in 1871 "upon
   the subject of the federal constitution, no work yet supersedes the
   elaborate treatise of Mr. Justice Story; though If it were re-written
   in view of recent events and authorities, it might be made much more
   valuable, and be largely increased in interest to those who shall
   hereafter read it.^[11] Thomas Cooley himself edited and added chapters
   and notes to the fourth edition of Story's Constitutional Commentaries.

   This is not to say that Story's Commentaries met with universal
   approval. Story's Commentaries were attacked by Southern writers such
   as Henry St. George Tucker, John Randolph Tucker, and Abel Parker
   Upshaw. "That Story was the focal point of Southern animus only
   testified to his prominence as the authority on the Constitution.^[12]
   HJ Powell in his "Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution: A
   Belated Review" (first published in the Yale Law Journal) quotes
   Upshaw's opinion that the Commentaries were "mere dogmas", and John
   Calhoun's opinion that Story's Commentaries were essentially false and
   dangerous.^[13]

Reputation in the law[edit]

   Story’s Constitutional commentaries have been cited in hundreds of
   cases before state and federal courts where constitutional issues are
   decided.^[14]
