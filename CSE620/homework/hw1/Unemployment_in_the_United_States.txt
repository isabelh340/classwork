   Unemployment in the United States discusses the causes and measures of
   U.S. unemployment and strategies for reducing it. Job creation and
   unemployment are affected by factors such as economic conditions,
   global competition, education, automation, and demographics. These
   factors can affect the number of workers, the duration of unemployment,
   and wage levels.

   Employment expanded consistently during the 1990s, but has been
   inconsistent since due to recessions in 2001 and 2008-2009. By some
   measures, the number of persons employed regained its 2007 pre-crisis
   peak only in 2014, but the labor force participation rate remained
   below its 2007 level.^[3] Unemployment generally falls during periods
   of economic prosperity and rises during recessions, creating
   significant pressure on public finances as tax revenue falls and social
   safety net costs increase. The major political parties debate
   appropriate solutions for improving the job creation rate, with
   liberals arguing for more government stimulus spending and
   conservatives arguing for lower taxes and less regulation. Polls
   indicate that Americans believe job creation is the most important
   government priority, with not sending jobs overseas the primary
   solution.^[4]

   Much of the 2012 Presidential campaign focused on job creation as a
   first priority, but the fiscal cliff and other budgetary debates took
   precedence in 2012 and early 2013. Critics argue prioritizing deficit
   reduction is misplaced, as there is no immediate fiscal crisis but
   there is a high level of unemployment, particularly long-term
   unemployment.^[5]

   Unemployment can be measured in several ways. A person is unemployed if
   they are jobless but looking for a job and available for work. People
   who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor force. For
   example, as of June 2014, the unemployment rate in the United States
   was 6.1%^[6] or 9.48 million people,^[7] while the government's broader
   U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the part-time underemployed was
   12.1%^[8] or 18.8 million people. These figures were calculated with a
   civilian labor force of approximately 155.7 million people,^[9]
   relative to a U.S. population of approximately 315 million people.^[10]

Definitions of unemployment[edit]

   The rate of U.S. unemployment under various definitions.

   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has defined the basic employment
   concepts as follows:^[12]
     * People with jobs are employed.
     * People who are jobless, looking for jobs, and available for work
       are unemployed.
     * People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor
       force.

Employed[edit]

   Employed persons consist of:
     * All persons who did any work for pay or profit during the survey
       reference week.
     * All persons who did at least 15 hours of unpaid work in a
       family-owned enterprise operated by someone in their household.
     * All persons who were temporarily absent from their regular jobs,
       whether they were paid or not.

Unemployed[edit]

   Who is counted as unemployed?
     * Persons are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job,
       have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are
       currently available for work.
     * Workers expecting to be recalled from layoff are counted as
       unemployed, whether or not they have engaged in a specific
       job-seeking activity.
     * In all other cases, the individual must have been engaged in at
       least one active job search activity in the 4 weeks preceding the
       interview and be available for work (except for temporary illness).

Labor force[edit]

   Who is not in the labor force?
     * Persons not in the labor force are those who are not classified as
       employed or unemployed during the survey reference week.
     * Labor force measures are based on the civilian non-institutional
       population 16 years old and over. (Excluded are persons under 16
       years of age, all persons confined to institutions such as nursing
       homes and prisons, and persons on active duty in the Armed Forces.)
     * The labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed.
     * The remainder—those who have no job and are not looking for one—are
       counted as "not in the labor force." Many who are not in the labor
       force are going to school or are retired. Family responsibilities
       keep others out of the labor force.

Recent employment trends[edit]

   There are a variety of measures used to track the state of the U.S.
   labor market. Each provides insight into the factors affecting
   employment.
     * Civilian employment, one measure of the size of the employed
       workforce, expanded consistently during the 1990s, but has been
       inconsistent since due to recessions in 2001 and 2008-2009. For
       example, employment did not recover its January 2001 peak of 137.8
       million until June 2003. Then, from the bubble-assisted peak in
       November 2007 of 146.6 million, 8.6 million jobs were lost due to
       the global economic crisis. U.S. employment began rising again
       after December 2009 and had nearly regained the pre-crisis peak by
       June 2014.^[13]

     * The unemployment rate rose from 5.0% in December 2007 to peak at
       10.0% in October 2009, before falling to 6.1% by June 2014.^[14]
       This measure excludes persons outside the workforce, which can
       distort its interpretation if a large number of working-aged
       persons become discouraged and stop looking for work.

     * The civilian employment to population ratio fell from its 2007
       pre-crisis peak of approximately 63% to 58% by November 2010 and
       partially recovered to 59% by June 2014.^[15] This measure is
       affected by demographics. The U.S. has a gradually aging
       population; therefore a greater percentage of people are retiring
       and leaving the workforce. This creates a steady downward trend.
       Analysts can adjust for the effect of demographics by examining the
       ratio for those aged 25–54. Even in this age group, the ratio fell
       from approximately 80% pre-crisis to 76% in June 2014, due mainly
       to the 2008-2009 recession and its aftermath.^[3]^[16]

     * The mix of jobs shifted more to part-time in the wake of the
       crisis; the number of full-time jobs in June 2014 remained
       approximately 3.7 million below the November 2007 pre-crisis peak,
       while the number of part-time jobs was 3.2 million higher.^[17]
       Some employers believe they can make their expenses more variable
       through part-time employees, which gives them more flexibility in
       matching costs to revenues.

     * The share of unemployed who have been out of work for 27 or more
       weeks (i.e., long-term unemployed) averaged approximately 19%
       pre-crisis; this peaked at 48.1% in April 2010 and fell to 30.4% by
       June 2014.^[18] Some research indicates the long-term unemployed
       may be stigmatized as having out-of-date skills, facing an uphill
       battle to return to the workforce.^[19]

   The U.S. Federal Reserve tracks a variety of labor market metrics,
   which affect how it sets monetary policy. One "dashboard" includes nine
   measures, only three of which have returned to their pre-crisis (2007)
   levels as of June 2014.^[20]^[21]

   From October 2010 to June 2014, the U.S. added a total of 8.5 million
   jobs, with positive job growth over each of those 45 months averaging
   189,000 jobs. During January to June 2014, the U.S. added an average of
   231,000 jobs per month, a robust rate by historical
   standards.^[13]^[22]

   Each month, The Hamilton Project examines the "jobs gap," which is the
   number of jobs that the U.S. economy needs to create to return to
   pre-recession employment levels while also absorbing the people who
   enter the labor force each month. Job creation would have to average
   208,000 per month to close the gap by 2020; 320,000 by 2017; or 472,000
   by mid-2015.^[23] During the prosperous 1990's decade, the U.S. created
   an average of 182,000 jobs/month.^[22]

Domestic factors[edit]

   There are many domestic factors affecting the U.S. labor force and
   employment levels. These include: economic growth; cyclical and
   structural factors; demographics; education and training; innovation;
   labor unions; and industry consolidation. Ben Bernanke discussed
   several factors during a March 2012 speech.^[24]

   Economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson wrote in July 2011: "Like many
   economists, I believe that the immediate crisis facing the United
   States economy is the jobs deficit, not the budget deficit. The
   magnitude of the jobs crisis is clearly illustrated by the jobs gap –
   currently around 12.3 million jobs. That is how many jobs the economy
   must add to return to its peak employment level before the 2008-9
   recession and to absorb the 125,000 people who enter the labor force
   each month. At the current pace of recovery, the gap will be not closed
   until 2020 or later." She explained further that job growth between
   2000 and 2007 was only half what it had been in the preceding three
   decades, pointing to several studies by other economists indicating
   globalization and technology change had highly negative effects on
   certain sectors of the U.S. workforce and overall wage levels.^[25]

Cyclical vs. structural unemployment[edit]

   The US Labor Participation Rate from 1948 to 2011 by gender. Men are
   represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.

   There is ongoing debate among economists regarding the extent to which
   unemployment is cyclical (i.e., temporary and related to economic
   cycles, and therefore responsive to stimulus measures that spur demand)
   or structural (i.e., longer-term and independent of the economic cycle,
   and therefore requiring process reforms and re-allocation of workers
   among industries and geographies).^[26]

   For example, a general reduction in employment across multiple
   industries would likely be cyclical, while a skills or geographic
   mismatch for available jobs would be structural. Ben Bernanke stated in
   November 2012: "[T]he slow pace of employment growth has been
   widespread across industries and regions of the country. That pattern
   suggests a broad-based shortfall in demand rather than a substantial
   increase in mismatch between available jobs and workers, because
   greater mismatch would imply that the demand for workers would be
   strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the
   board. Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant
   problem, we would expect to see wage pressures developing in those
   regions and industries where labor demand is strong; in fact, wage
   gains have been quite subdued in most industries and parts of the
   country."^[27]

   The Congressional Research Service summarized a variety of studies that
   indicated changes in unemployment between 2007 and 2010 were 65-80%
   cyclical, thus mainly due to reduced aggregate demand for goods and
   services. Labor mobility was not a key issue due to the widespread
   nature of job losses across geographies and industries. Cyclically
   sensitive industries such as manufacturing and construction had the
   most significant job losses. One study referenced in the CRS research
   indicated that long-term unemployment can convert cyclical to
   structural unemployment through loss of skills.^[28]

   Mohamed El-Erian wrote in May 2011: "Unemployment must be seen as much
   more than a cyclical problem; it's a structural one that requires
   concurrent progress on job retraining, housing reform, education,
   social safety nets and private-sector competitiveness...America's
   political parties must jointly agree [to make] progress on the
   structural-reform agenda..."^[29]^[30] Several tools, such as the
   Beveridge curve are used to help analyze the extent of structural
   unemployment.^[31]

   The term frictional unemployment refers to the period when workers are
   searching for a job or changing jobs. It is sometimes called search
   unemployment and can be voluntary based on the circumstances of the
   unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment is always present in an
   economy, so the level of involuntary unemployment is properly the
   unemployment rate minus the rate of frictional unemployment.

   The Natural rate of unemployment refers to the rate of unemployment due
   to structural or supply-side factors alone. Cyclical factors, such as
   government stimulus or austerity policies, cause the actual
   unemployment rate to vary around the natural rate. Economists debate
   the natural rate of unemployment. During February 2011, Federal Reserve
   economists estimated it may have increased from the historical rate of
   around 5% to as high as 6.7%. CBO estimated the rate of a closely
   related measure called NAIRU at 5.2%, up from 4.8%.^[32]^[33]

Demographics & labor force participation rate[edit]

   The percentage of the US civilian working age population employed,
   1995–2012.

   Demographics have a significant impact on the labor force and therefore
   employment statistics. There is a long-term trend of declining labor
   force participation in the U.S. The U.S. population is aging and the
   Baby Boomers are moving into retirement, so a greater share of the
   population is either leaving the labor force (retired) or moving into
   an age bracket with a lower typical labor force participation
   rate.^[34]^[35]

   Reasons for the decline in labor force participation vary. One Federal
   Reserve economist estimated that demographics accounted for two-thirds
   of the decline since 2000. Other Federal Reserve studies place the
   blame primarily on the recession of 2008-2009.^[36]

   Analyzing the 25-54 prime working age range can help correct for the
   effects of aging Boomers leaving the workforce. The jobs created since
   the end of the recession (2009) have not been sufficient to show a
   significant improvement in employment for the 25-54 age range.^[37] In
   the 16-64 age range, from mid-2008 to March 2013 the ratios of employed
   men and women have declined by approximately 6 and 3 percentage points,
   respectively.^[38]

   The Hamilton Project reported in March 2012 that: "As the Baby Boomers
   retire, immigration flows change, and the number of young people
   entering the labor force declines, the number of new jobs needed to
   maintain pre-recession employment norms will decline...One result of
   this aging of the population is that overall labor force participation
   rates (and therefore the number of new jobs required to keep up with
   the labor force) are expected to decline."^[39]^[40]

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a monthly employment situation
   summary. For June 2014: "Among the major worker groups, the
   unemployment rates for adult women (5.3 percent) and blacks (10.7
   percent) declined in June, and the rate increased for teenagers (21.0
   percent). The rates for adult men (5.7 percent), whites (5.3 percent),
   and Hispanics (7.8 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for
   Asians was 5.1 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a
   year earlier. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27
   weeks or more) declined by 293,000 in June to 3.1 million; these
   individuals accounted for 32.8 percent of the unemployed. Over the past
   12 months, the number of long-term unemployed has decreased by 1.2
   million."^[41]

Education and training[edit]

   The U.S. unemployment rate by education level.

   Workers with higher levels of education face considerably lower rates
   of unemployment. As of September 2012, for workers of age 25 or older,
   unemployment was approximately: 12% for those with less than a high
   school diploma; 9% for high school graduates; 6% for those with some
   college or an associates degree; and 4% for those with a bachelor's
   degree or higher.^[42]

   The Pew Research Center estimated in 2012 that the average college
   graduate earns as much as $650,000 more than the average high school
   graduate over the course of a 40 year career, roughly $1.4 million
   versus $770,000. Factoring in the cost of college and foregone
   investment income, the average college graduate still ends up an
   estimated $550,000 ahead. This difference depends significantly on the
   type of major and type of employment.^[43]

   The American Enterprise Institute reported in September 2011 that:
   "...the evidence that the quality of a nation's education system is a
   key determinant of the future growth of its economy is increasingly
   strong." In 2010, America's high-school graduation rate trailed the
   average for European Union countries and ranked no better than
   eighteenth among the 26 OECD countries for which comparable data was
   available. President Obama often has stated that education is a key
   driver of international competitiveness and employment.^[44]

   U.S. companies cut employee training programs approximately 11% in 2008
   and again in 2009 in an effort to cut costs during the 2008-2009
   recession, but increased their training costs thereafter.^[45]
   According to 2012 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) industry
   survey, 63% of employees learn the skills required to do their job
   while on the job. Approximately 38% of companies said they cross-train
   employees to develop skills not directly related to their job, down
   from 43% in 2011 and 55% in 2008. Some companies believe that with high
   unemployment, they can find the skills necessary should job openings
   arise.^[46]

   A variety of experts have proposed education reforms to improve U.S.
   competitiveness. Ideas relate to better qualified and incentivized
   teachers, less reliance on standardized testing, better feedback
   systems to help struggling teachers and students, more investment,
   paying for performance, employing data systems that track how much a
   child learns from a teacher, measuring teacher quality, giving local
   administrators the ability to manage staff and finances, and comparing
   results to the best education systems in the world.^[47]

   The rapid pace of technology change and global competition are
   rewarding those who continuously improve their skills and education.
   Futurist Alvin Toffler wrote: "The illiterate of the future are not
   those that cannot read or write. They are those that cannot learn,
   unlearn, relearn."^[48]

   Thomas L. Friedman wrote: "How [can workers] adapt? It will require
   more individual initiative. We know that it will be vital to have more
   of the 'right' education than less, that you will need to develop
   skills that are complementary to technology rather than ones that can
   be easily replaced by it and that we need everyone to be innovating new
   products and services to employ the people who are being liberated from
   routine work by automation and software. The winners won’t just be
   those with more I.Q. It will also be those with more P.Q. (passion
   quotient) and C.Q. (curiosity quotient) to leverage all the new digital
   tools to not just find a job, but to invent one or reinvent one, and to
   not just learn but to relearn for a lifetime."^[49]

Skills gap[edit]

   A "skills gap" would exist if employers were demanding skills that the
   workforce did not provide. The hypothesis of such a gap in the USA
   recently grew stronger, in part due to the poor results of the country
   at OECD adult skills survey.^[50] However, there was limited evidence
   post-2008 crisis that the U.S. was really facing a skill gap.
   Unemployment remained higher for workers at all education levels.
   Further, workers with the "right" skills would theoretically receive
   significant raises if there were skills shortages, which was not
   occurring. Paul Krugman wrote in March 2014: "Meanwhile, multiple
   careful studies have found no support for claims that inadequate worker
   skills explain high unemployment." He continued that a U.S. skills gap
   was a "zombie idea...an idea that should have been killed by evidence,
   but refuses to die."^[51]

Long-term unemployment[edit]

   The mean and median duration of U.S. unemployment.

   Long-term unemployment is defined by the International Labor
   Organization (ILO) as referring to people who have been unemployed for
   27 weeks or longer and are actively seeking employment. Other
   measurements have been used by different Bureaus and Agencies
   worldwide. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies unemployment
   based on various aspects into six groups (U1-U6), with U3 referring to
   the most widely recognized, ILO definition.

   The ratio of long-term unemployed (27 weeks or longer) to unemployed
   rose from 17.3% in December 2007 (pre-recession) to a peak of 48.1%
   during April 2010. It has steadily fallen to a still elevated 30.4% as
   of June 2014.^[52]^[53] This is well above the 1980-2007 average of
   approximately 16% and the approximately 20-25% level typical in
   previous recessions since 1980.^[54]^[55]

   Economists believe that long-term unemployment can be transformed into
   structural unemployment, meaning that a large group of workers may no
   longer match employers' needs or are no longer considered employable.
   Skills may become obsolete, business contact lists become outdated, and
   current industry information is lost. As of September 2012, about
   800,000 workers wanted a job but had given up looking, and so are no
   longer even counted as unemployed.^[56]

   About 1.7 million people joined the disability rolls since the
   recession began at the end of 2007, an increase of 24%, as workers use
   the disability program as a backdoor safety net when their unemployment
   insurance runs out. After searching for a new position for a year, a
   worker trying to regain employment finds that their chance to do so in
   the coming month falls below 10%. Job training programs and incentives
   for companies to hire the long-term unemployed are among the solutions
   available, but gathering the political will to address an isolated
   group is difficult. The long-term unemployed are less likely to
   vote.^[57]

   CBO reported several options for addressing long-term unemployment
   during February 2012. Two short-term options included policies to: 1)
   Reduce the marginal cost to businesses of adding employees; and 2) Tax
   policies targeted towards people most likely to spend the additional
   income, mainly those with lower income. Over the long-run, structural
   reforms such as programs to facilitate re-training workers or education
   assistance would be helpful.^[58]

Labor unions[edit]

   Further information: Labor unions in the United States
   Union membership in the United States from the Great Depression to
   current day.

   Economist Paul Krugman wrote that historically, worker participation in
   labor unions gave workers more power in negotiating how corporate
   profits were split up with shareholders and management. Organized labor
   acted to limit layoffs. Strong labor unions were a check on executive
   pay, keeping top executive pay at considerably lower ratios relative to
   the average worker during the 1950s than during the 2000s. Unions were
   also a factor in income equality, helping ensure that middle class
   worker pay rose along with the pay of the higher income brackets.^[59]

   However, labor union participation rates have declined steadily in the
   United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics annual Union
   Members Summary: "In 2012, the union membership rate--the percent of
   wage and salary workers who were members of a union--was 11.3 percent,
   down from 11.8 percent in 2011. The number of wage and salary workers
   belonging to unions, at 14.4 million, also declined over the year. In
   1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available, the
   union membership rate was 20.1 percent, and there were 17.7 million
   union workers."^[60] In 1973, the participation rate was 26.7% against
   a comparable 2011 rate of 13.1%.^[61]

   Differences in labor law and public policy are a key reason for this
   decline. For example, Canada has gone through many of the same economic
   and social changes as the U.S. since the middle of the 20th century,
   but it hasn’t seen the same substantial decline in unionization. The
   unionization rate in the U.S. and Canada followed fairly similar paths
   from 1920 to the mid-1960s, at which point they began to diverge
   drastically, with Canada remaining around 30% while the U.S. fell to
   around 11%.^[62]

Industry consolidation[edit]

   Industry consolidation or concentration refers to fewer, larger firms
   driving competition in an industry versus more, smaller firms. Job
   creation by small businesses can be restricted when larger, more
   productive firms displace them. For example, the share of customer
   deposits held by the top 10 largest U.S. banks rose from 15% in 1993,
   to 44% in 2006, and to 49% by 2009. The number of commercial banks fell
   from over 14,000 in 1984 to approximately 7,000 by 2010.^[63]

   Economists Barry Lynn and Phillip Longman at the New America Foundation
   wrote in March 2010:
     * "It is now widely accepted among scholars that small businesses are
       responsible for most of the net job creation in the United States.
       It is also widely agreed that small businesses tend to be more
       inventive, producing more patents per employee, for example, than
       do larger firms. Less well established is what role concentration
       plays in suppressing new business formation and the expansion of
       existing businesses, along with the jobs and innovation that go
       with such growth. Evidence is growing, however, that the radical,
       wide-ranging consolidation of recent years has reduced job creation
       at both big and small firms simultaneously."

     * "In nearly every sector of our economy, far fewer firms control far
       greater shares of their markets than they did a generation ago.
       Indeed, in the years after officials in the Reagan administration
       radically altered how our government enforces our anti-monopoly
       laws, the American economy underwent a truly revolutionary
       restructuring. Four great waves of mergers and acquisitions—in the
       mid-1980s, early '90s, late '90s, and between 2003 and
       2007—transformed America's industrial landscape at least as much as
       globalization."

     * "Over the same two decades, meanwhile, the spread of mega-retailers
       like Wal-Mart and Home Depot and agricultural behemoths like
       Smithfield and Tyson's resulted in a more piecemeal approach to
       consolidation, through the destruction or displacement of countless
       independent family-owned businesses."^[64]^[65]

Income and wealth inequality[edit]

   U.S. inequality from 1913–2008.^[66]
   Main article: Income inequality in the United States

   Since the 1980s, wealthier households in the United States have earned
   a larger and larger share of overall income. As of 2010, the top 1% of
   households by income earned about one-sixth of all income and the top
   10% earned about half of it. In other words, the rising tide of
   economic growth does not lift all boats equally. Wealth is also skewed,
   with the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 90% of households.
   Several prominent economists and financial entities have reported that
   income inequality hurts economic growth and can be economically
   destabilizing.^[67]^[68]

   Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in 2012 that moving money from the
   bottom to the top of the income spectrum through income inequality
   lowers consumption, and therefore economic growth and job creation.
   Higher-income individuals consume a smaller proportion of their income
   than do lower-income individuals; those at the top save 15-25% of their
   income, while those at the bottom spend all of their income.^[69]^[70]

   Further, as income skews to the top, middle-class families may go
   deeper into debt than they would otherwise, which restricts consumption
   once they begin to repay it. Evidence suggests that income inequality
   has been the driving factor in the growing household debt^[71]^[72] as
   middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once
   was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent
   saw their debt fall from 80 cents for every dollar of income to 65
   cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents
   for every dollar of income to $1.40.^[71] Economist Paul Krugman has
   found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in
   America over the last hundred years.^[73]

Government hiring trends[edit]

   Most states have balanced budget rules, which forced them to cut
   spending when tax revenues fell due to the 2008-2009 recession and its
   aftermath. Over 500,000 jobs were cut by states and municipalities
   between 2008-2012. This was different from other recent U.S.
   recessions, where government employment continued to climb. This trend
   is expected to reverse in 2013, with states and municipalities adding
   workers for the first time in five years. State and local government
   spending accounted for 12% GDP in 2011.^[74]

   Fed Chair Ben Bernanke testified in May 2013 that: "Notably, over the
   past four years, state and local governments have cut civilian
   government employment by roughly 700,000 jobs, and total government
   employment has fallen by more than 800,000 jobs over the same period.
   For comparison, over the four years following the trough of the 2001
   recession, total government employment rose by more than 500,000
   jobs."^[75]

   Government spending employs private sector workers in several
   industries, such as ship and boat building, facilities services,
   aerospace, etc. The 2013 sequester has significantly impacting hiring
   in these industries, which are lagging employment growth in other
   industries. The New York Times reported in June 2013 that: "Across the
   five industries that are most sensitive to changes in military
   spending, employment fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in March and
   stayed flat in April, the latest month for which seasonally adjusted
   data are available. In all other sectors, by contrast, employment grew
   at annualized rates of about 1.6 percent in March and 1.7 percent in
   April. Before the start of the sequester on March 1, employment at
   private companies heavily dependent on military spending had been more
   closely tracking employment in the rest of the economy, though the
   numbers were somewhat uneven. Military payrolls have been declining
   almost every month since November 2011 in response to the drawdown in
   American wars abroad."^[76]

Policies regarding full employment[edit]

   Annual rate of change of unemployment rate under various US Presidents
   The values indicate the average annual rate of change in the
   unemployment rate over the years in office. Data 1945-present from
   Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Force Statistics, Data previous to
   1945 from McElvaine's The Great Depression, Three Rivers Press (2009),
   Chapter 4

   Jared Bernstein wrote in May 2013 that the U.S. used to focus on full
   employment as a policy priority, but this focus has waned since 1980.
   Full employment refers to having an available job for everyone who
   wants one. Specific laws were passed to help achieve this goal, such as
   the Employment Act of 1946 and the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act
   of 1978. From 1945-1979, the U.S. was at full employment two-thirds of
   the time. Conservatives and business interests pushed back however, as
   tight labor markets meant more worker bargaining power, higher wages
   and less profitability. Since 1980, full employment ("defined as an
   unemployment rate below 5 percent") has been maintained one-third of
   the time.^[77]

   Bernstein argued there are several possible reasons for the reduction
   in frequency of full employment:
     * As labor unions weakened, politicians focused less on the working
       class and more on issues related to the wealthy, such as inflation,
       budget deficits and tax policy;

     * Capital investment may have become more "labor saving," with
       productivity improving and automation accelerating;

     * Large and persistent trade deficits have exported significant
       demand. Trade deficits averaged 5% GDP during the 2000s, versus 1%
       GDP in the 1990s, representing the loss of millions of jobs; and

     * Growing income inequality has reduced the ability of the middle
       class to demand as many goods and services as it otherwise would
       be, affecting many middle-class jobs.^[77]

Unemployment among younger workers[edit]

   The employment situation from 2009 to 2013 was particularly difficult
   for younger workers. The Economic Policy Institute reported in April
   2013 that:
     * The March 2013 unemployment rate of 16.2% for workers under age 25
       was slightly over twice the national average.

     * Weak demand for goods and services is the primary driver of this
       unemployment, not a skills mismatch.

     * Graduating in a bad economy has long-lasting economic consequences.
       For the next 10 to 15 years, those in the Class of 2013 will likely
       earn less than if they had graduated when the economy were at its
       potential.

     * For young high school graduates, the unemployment rate is 29.9%
       (compared with 17.5% in 2007) and the underemployment rate is 51.5%
       (compared with 29.4% in 2007).

     * For young college graduates, the unemployment rate is 8.8% (vs.
       5.7% in 2007) and the underemployment rate is 18.3% (vs. 9.9% in
       2007).^[78]

Job openings relative to unemployed[edit]

   The ratio of job seekers to job openings is another indicator used to
   analyze unemployment trends. The number of unemployed persons per job
   opening rose from 2.9 in 2003 to 6.7 at its peak in July 2009, before
   falling to 3.1 in April 2013. EPI reported in June 2013 that: "In
   today’s economy, unemployed workers far outnumber job openings in every
   sector...This demonstrates that the main problem in the labor market is
   a broad-based lack of demand for workers—and not, as is often claimed,
   available workers lacking the skills needed for the sectors with job
   openings."^[79]^[80]

Global factors[edit]

Offshoring of employment[edit]

   Offshoring has become an increasingly common practice of locating jobs
   in low-cost labor countries. The practice is expanding in both
   manufacturing and service jobs. Motivation varies; labor cost savings
   or "labor arbitrage", productivity and regulatory avoidance are
   potential reasons. Studies have shown that offshoring is a source of
   significant uncertainty in the labor force. There is significant debate
   regarding the extent to which this is affecting U.S. job creation. The
   Congressional Research Service reported a summary of several studies on
   offshoring in January 2011:^[81]
     * Forrester Research projected in 2004 that a total of 3.4 million
       service sector jobs might move abroad by 2015. Forrester projected
       that a total of 1.2 million services jobs might be relocated
       offshore between 2003 and 2008.

     * Economists Bardhan and Kroll estimated in 2003 that more than 14
       million jobs, representing about 11% of U.S. employment in 2001,
       have attributes that could allow them to be sent overseas (e.g., no
       in-person customer servicing required; an IT-enabled work process
       that can be accomplished via telecommuting; jobs that can be
       routinized; a fairly wide gap between a job's pay in the United
       States compared to in a destination country; and a destination
       country having few language, institutional, and cultural barriers.)

     * Economists Jensen and Kletzer estimated in 2005 that about 9.4% of
       total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries.
       Approximately 14% of employment in professional services industries
       might be vulnerable to offshoring compared to 12.4% of employment
       in manufacturing industries.

     * The Brookings Institution estimated in 2007 that offshoring may
       impact 2.2% of the jobs in 246 metro areas.

     * The Bureau of Labor statistics estimated that one-fifth of U.S.
       workers were in industries subject to offshoring. The 33
       service-providing occupations found to be most susceptible to
       offshoring experienced below average employment and wage growth
       during the 2001-2007 period. The skills and education of this most
       vulnerable group range widely.

     * Economist Alan Blinder estimated in 2009 that up to 30 million jobs
       may be offshorable.^[81]

   An estimated 750,000 call center jobs were off-shored by U.S. firms to
   India and the Philippines as of November 2011.^[82] The New York Times
   reported in January 2012 that: "Apple employs 43,000 people in the
   United States and 20,000 overseas...Many more people work for Apple’s
   contractors: an additional 700,000 people engineer, build and assemble
   iPads, iPhones and Apple’s other products. But almost none of them work
   in the United States."^[83]

   Princeton economist Alan Blinder said in 2007 that the number of jobs
   at risk of being shipped out of the country could reach 40 million over
   the next 10 to 20 years, which represents one out of every three
   service sector jobs.^[84]

   The Economist reported in January 2013 that: "High levels of
   unemployment in Western countries after the 2007-2008 financial crisis
   have made the public in many countries so hostile towards off-shoring
   that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it." Further, The
   Economist reported that off-shoring trends are evolving for several
   other reasons:
     * Wages in China and India have been increasing for 10-20% a year for
       the past decade while U.S. wages have been relatively stagnant,
       reducing the cost advantage of off-shoring.

     * Shipping costs are rising and long shipping lead times can affect
       customer service in certain industries.

     * Separating production and research & development functions has
       adversely impacted innovation.

     * Multinational corporations are moving production closer to their
       target customers, which in some cases means back to the U.S.^[85]

   The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA)
   prepares an annual report on those petitioning for trade adjustment
   assistance, due to jobs lost from international trade. This represents
   a fraction of jobs actually off-shored and does not include jobs that
   are placed overseas initially or the collateral impact on surrounding
   businesses when, for example, a manufacturing plant moves overseas.
   During 2011, there were 98,379 workers covered by petitions filed with
   ETA.^[86] The figure was 280,873 in 2010,^[87] 201,053 in 2009 and
   126,633 in 2008.^[88]

Comparative international wage levels[edit]

   One of the reasons for off-shoring jobs or sourcing goods overseas has
   been considerably lower wages in developing or Asian countries. The NY
   Times reported in December 2012 that: "American wages are [not]
   anywhere close to those in countries in East Asia or other places where
   American imports come from. As of 2010 (the latest year available),
   hourly compensation costs for manufacturing in the United States were
   about four times those in Taiwan, and 20 times those in the
   Philippines, according to the Labor Department." However, foreign wages
   have been rising since 2000, while those in the U.S. have been
   stagnant.^[89]

   During 2011, entry level call center workers in the U.S. earned about
   $20,000 per year, about six times as much as similar jobs in
   India.^[82] According to the Congressional Research Service, during
   2006, compensation for the average American production worker was
   $24.59 per hour, compared to $16.02 in South Korea, $2.92 in Mexico,
   and $0.81 in China.^[90]

   CEO's are under pressure from their boards to maximize profits and are
   paid bonuses accordingly; one method of doing so is offshoring jobs or
   sourcing inputs in the lowest wage countries possible. Firms in
   low-cost labor countries actively lobby U.S. and European companies to
   offshore a variety of jobs or locate new jobs and facilities
   overseas.^[91]

Trade deficits and currency valuation[edit]

   This section possibly contains previously unpublished synthesis of
   published material that conveys ideas not attributable to the original
   sources. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. (January
   2013)
   The U.S. Current Account or Trade Deficit.

Trade deficit[edit]

   Net exports are a major component of GDP. In the U.S., net exports are
   negative due to a trade deficit that is much larger than historical
   average. There is significant debate regarding the impact of the trade
   deficit on the economy and employment, and therefore the budget
   deficit. For example, The Economist wrote in July 2012 that the inflow
   of investment dollars required to fund the trade deficit was a major
   cause of the housing bubble and financial crisis: "The trade deficit,
   less than 1% of GDP in the early 1990s, hit 6% in 2006. That deficit
   was financed by inflows of foreign savings, in particular from East
   Asia and the Middle East. Much of that money went into dodgy mortgages
   to buy overvalued houses, and the financial crisis was the
   result."^[92]

   NPR explained in their Peabody-Award winning article "The Giant Pool of
   Money" that a vast inflow of savings from developing nations flowed
   into the mortgage market, driving the U.S. housing bubble. This pool of
   fixed income savings increased from around $35 trillion in 2000 to
   about $70 trillion by 2008. NPR explained this money came from various
   sources, "[b]ut the main headline is that all sorts of poor countries
   became kind of rich, making things like TVs and selling us oil. China,
   India, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia made a lot of money and banked it."^[93]
   During 2008, then U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker argued that
   the U.S. faced four deficits that posed significant risk to its fiscal
   future: Budget, balance of payments, savings and leadership.^[94]

   A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that a trade
   deficit is a factor in whether a country will pay higher interest rates
   as its public debt level rises, which increases the risk of fiscal
   crisis. Both the U.S. and Eurozone countries (excluding Germany) had
   significant trade deficits leading up to the crisis.^[95]^[96] A
   rebuttal to their paper indicated that the trade deficit (which
   requires private borrowing to fund) may be a bigger factor than public
   debt in causing a rise in interest rates.^[97]

Currency policy[edit]

   Policies that affect the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other
   currencies also affect employment levels. Economist Christina Romer
   wrote in May 2011: "A weaker dollar means that our goods are cheaper
   relative to foreign goods. That stimulates our exports and reduces our
   imports. Higher net exports raise domestic production and employment.
   Foreign goods are more expensive, but more Americans are working. Given
   the desperate need for jobs, on net we are almost surely better off
   with a weaker dollar for a while."^[98] Economist Paul Krugman wrote in
   May 2011: "First, what's driving the turnaround in our manufacturing
   trade? The main answer is that the U.S. dollar has fallen against other
   currencies, helping give U.S.-based manufacturing a cost advantage. A
   weaker dollar, it turns out, was just what U.S. industry needed."^[99]

   Economists C. Fred Bergsten and Joseph E. Gagnon wrote in September
   2012: "The most overlooked cause of the economic weakness in the United
   States and Europe is what we call the 'global currency wars.' If all
   currency intervention were to cease, we estimate that the US trade
   deficit would fall by $150 billion to $300 billion, or 1 to 2 percent
   of gross domestic product. Between 1 million and 2 million jobs would
   be created. The euro area would gain by a lesser but still substantial
   amount. Countries that were engaged in intervention could offset the
   impact on their economies by expanding domestic demand."^[100]

Tradable and non-tradable sectors[edit]

   Economist Michael Spence analyzed U.S. employment trends from 1990 to
   2008, separating workforce components into two major sectors:
     * Non-tradeable sector, meaning those jobs that must be done locally,
       such as healthcare, government and construction. Of the 27.3
       million jobs added during the period, 26.7 million were in the
       non-tradeable sector. From 1990 to 2008, the jobs in this sector
       increased from 88 million to 115 million.

     * Internationally tradeable sector, meaning jobs related to goods
       that can be produced in one country and consumed in another, such
       as manufacturing, agriculture and energy, or consumed by people
       from another country, such as tourism. Lower- and middle- value
       added jobs have been moved abroad as part of globalized supply
       chains, resulting in less than one million jobs created during the
       period in this sector. During 1990, there were 34 million jobs in
       this sector; these grew slowly for about a decade then returned to
       their starting point by 2008.

   Spence advocates structural reforms to help grow the tradeable sector
   jobs. Further, value-added per employee has been growing slowly in the
   non-tradeable sector. These trends are correlated with increasing
   income inequality and indicate significant structural issues face the
   U.S. labor market.^[101]

Globalization commentary[edit]

   sources. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. (January
   2013)
   An 1837 political cartoon about unemployment in the United States.

   Economist Paul Krugman wrote: "By contrast, trade between countries at
   very different levels of economic development tends to create large
   classes of losers as well as winners. Although the outsourcing of some
   high-tech jobs to India has made headlines, on balance, highly educated
   workers in the United States benefit from higher wages and expanded job
   opportunities because of trade...But workers with less formal education
   either see their jobs shipped overseas or find their wages driven down
   by the ripple effect as other workers with similar qualifications crowd
   into their industries and look for employment to replace the jobs they
   lost to foreign competition. And lower prices at Wal-Mart aren’t
   sufficient compensation."^[102]

   Fareed Zakaria described the factors slowing growth in developed
   countries like the U.S., writing in November 2011: "The fact is that
   Western economies – with high wages, generous middle-class subsidies
   and complex regulations and taxes – have become sclerotic. Now they
   face pressures from three fronts: demography (an aging population),
   technology (which has allowed companies to do much more with fewer
   people) and globalization (which has allowed manufacturing and services
   to locate across the world)."^[103]

   Former Fed chair Paul Volcker argued in February 2010 that the U.S.
   should make more of the goods it consumes domestically: "We need to do
   more manufacturing again. We're never going to be the major world
   manufacturer as we were some years ago, but we could do more than we're
   doing and be more competitive. And we've got to close that big gap. You
   know, consumption is running about 5 percent above normal. That 5
   percent is reflected just about equally to what we're importing in
   excess of what we're exporting. And we've got to bring that back into
   closer balance."^[104]

   Economist Peter Navarro wrote in June 2011: "The American economy has
   been in trouble for more than a decade, and no amount of right-wing tax
   cuts or left-wing fiscal stimuli will solve the primary structural
   problem underpinning our slow growth and high unemployment. That
   problem is a massive, persistent trade deficit — most of it with China
   — that cuts the number of jobs created by nearly the number we need to
   keep America fully employed."^[105] Economist Peter Morici wrote in May
   2012: "Cutting the trade deficit in half, through domestic energy
   development and conservation, and offsetting Chinese exchange rate
   subsidies would increase GDP by about $525 billion a year and create at
   least 5 million jobs."^[106]

   Economist Michael Spence explained in August 2011 that over the
   1990-2008 period, job creation was almost entirely in the
   "non-tradable" sector (which produces goods and services that must be
   consumed domestically, like healthcare) with few jobs created in the
   "tradable" sector (which produces goods that can be sold
   internationally, like manufacturing). He stated that job creation in
   both sectors is necessary and that various factors, such as the housing
   bubble, hid the lack of job creation in the tradable sector. He stated:
   "We're going to have to try to fix the ineffective parts of our
   educational system...We're under-investing in things like
   infrastructure...we've just been living on consumption and we need to
   live a little bit more on investment, including public-sector
   investment." He also advocated tax policy changes to encourage hiring
   of U.S. workers.^[107]

Other factors[edit]

Automation and technology change[edit]

   In addition to off-shoring, technological change and automation of
   labor have impacted job growth in certain industries. A technology
   revolution is fast replacing human beings with machines in virtually
   every sector and industry in the global economy. Global unemployment
   has now reached its highest level since the great depression of the
   1930s. That figure is likely to rise sharply between now and the turn
   of the century as millions of new entrants into the workforce find
   themselves without jobs. As a science fiction writer might ask: "Who
   has a job once the robots repair the robots?" As wages or healthcare
   costs rise, companies have a growing financial incentive to automate
   more of their production and service processes. While automation has
   displaced millions of workers in various cycles (e.g., agriculture in
   the U.S. in the early 1900s) other industries have typically taken
   their place.^[108]^[109]

   Economist Henry Hazlitt explained in the 1979 edition of his book
   Economics in One Lesson why automation tends to create as many or more
   jobs overall than it destroys:
     * It requires labor and capital to build the machines that replace
       the workers whose jobs have been automated away, which creates jobs
       partially or fully offsetting the initial loss;

     * After the machines have produced sufficient economies to offset
       their cost, the owners can expect increased profits, which can be
       spent in the same or different industry, also creating jobs;

     * If competitors also adopt the machines, prices in the industry will
       begin to drop. This may increase the quantity of the goods
       demanded. This also allows savings to be passed along to consumers,
       who can use the difference to spend in the same or different
       industry, also creating jobs.

   Hazlitt wrote that these three offsets tend to increase jobs overall.
   Further, automation increases production, productivity and real wages
   over the long-run. He explained that over the course of human history,
   the number of persons employed tends to jump along with advances in
   technology. While jobs are destroyed in one activity, more jobs are
   typically created in others.^[110]

   However, MIT economists Brynjolfsson and McAfee estimated in January
   2013 that technology is potentially destroying more jobs than it is
   creating: "Technology is always creating jobs. It's always destroying
   jobs. But right now the pace of destroying them is accelerating...So as
   a consequence, we are not creating jobs at the same pace that we need
   to." Routine, middle-skill jobs are being eliminated by advances in
   business processes and technology, for example: self-service
   applications such as internet ordering in retail, grocery
   self-checkout, and ATM machines; manufacturing assembly robots;
   logistics such as warehouse robots that can move goods from storage to
   shipping; and healthcare, where robots are moving meals and medical
   waste in hospitals. McAfee sees this trend of technology eliminating
   jobs continuing for some time: "When I see what computers and robots
   can do right now, I project that forward for two, three more
   generations, I think we're going to find ourselves in a world where the
   work as we currently think about it it, is largely done by
   machines."^[111]^[112]

   Matt Miller wrote in January 2013 that this automation may have
   profound policy implications. If robots replace a vast number of
   workers, wage income may not be sufficient to support the middle class.
   More and more wealth will be concentrated in the hands of capital
   (e.g., those who make and own the robots doing the work). This could
   require significant changes in tax and redistribution policies on a
   massive scale.^[113] During August 2011, Taiwan manufacturing company
   Foxconn announced that it would be using up to one million robots to
   replace human laborers.^[114]

   Paul Krugman discussed this automation in December 2012: "This is an
   old concern in economics; it's 'capital-biased technological change',
   which tends to shift the distribution of income away from workers to
   the owners of capital...Twenty years ago, when I was writing about
   globalization and inequality, capital bias didn't look like a big
   issue; the major changes in income distribution had been among
   workers...rather than between labor and capital. So the academic
   literature focused almost exclusively on 'skill bias," supposedly
   explaining the rising college premium. But the college premium hasn't
   risen for a while. What has happened, on the other hand, is a notable
   shift in income away from labor...I think we'd better start paying
   attention to those implications." Krugman used a chart to show how the
   share of compensation income as a % GDP had fallen consistently from
   60% in 1970 to 55% in 2011.^[65]^[115]

   One possible consequence is that as developing country wages rise, U.S.
   companies may decide to automate the jobs but return the activity to
   the U.S., a phenomenon some refer to as "re-shoring" (as opposed to
   "off-shoring").^[89]

   Although U.S. manufacturing employment declined from 17 million workers
   to 12 million from 2000-2011, production has returned to 2000
   levels.^[116]^[117] In other words, productivity, supported by
   significant automation or process improvements, may be a significant
   driver of job losses in that industry, along with off-shoring.

Innovation[edit]

   Relatively new, smaller firms are the primary job creators. A 2009
   study by the Kauffman Foundation using U.S. Census data indicated that:
     * "From 1980-2005, nearly all net job creation in the United States
       occurred in firms less than five years old...without startups, net
       job creation for the American economy would be negative in all but
       a handful of years."
     * "If one excludes startups, an analysis of the 2007 Census data
       shows that young firms (defined as one to five years old) still
       account for roughly two-thirds of job creation, averaging nearly
       four new jobs per firm per year."
     * "Of the overall 12 million new jobs added in 2007, young firms were
       responsible for the creation of nearly 8 million of those jobs."
       (Note: This is a gross number not reduced by jobs lost; the economy
       generally creates and destroys millions of jobs in any given year.)
     * "Given this information, it is clear that new and young companies
       and the entrepreneurs that create them are the engines of job
       creation and eventual economic recovery. The distinction of firm
       age, not necessarily size, as the driver of job creation has many
       implications, particularly for policymakers who are focusing on
       small business as the answer to a dire employment situation."^[118]

   In the globalized free market, innovation does not necessarily mean the
   jobs will be created domestically. A popular product, the Apple iPod,
   offers an interesting perspective on globalization and employment. This
   product was developed by a U.S. corporation. In 2006, it was produced
   by about 14,000 workers in the U.S. and 27,000 overseas. Further, the
   salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to
   highly skilled U.S. professionals, as opposed to lower skilled U.S.
   retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor. Increasingly,
   globalization is shifting incomes to those with the highest educational
   backgrounds and professional skills. One interpretation of this result
   is that U.S. innovation can create more jobs overseas than
   domestically.^[119]^[120] During 2011, Apple employed 43,000 U.S.
   workers and 20,000 overseas. However, nearly 700,000 workers overseas
   working for other companies made nearly all of its iPhone, iPad and
   other products.^[121]

   Andrew Grove wrote in July 2010 that key technology innovations are
   increasingly "scaled" or mass-produced in Asia, with a 10-1 ratio of
   overseas to domestic workers. He wrote that Asian countries "seem to
   understand that job creation must be the No. 1 objective of economic
   policy." He recommended a tax on products made off-shore, to be used to
   fund companies that will scale their U.S. operations.^[122]

Industry-specific factors[edit]

   U.S. manufacturing employment (left axis) and construction employment
   (right axis).

   Industries may have long-term and short-term factors that drive trends
   in employment. Manufacturing and construction are two major industry
   groups that illustrate such factors.

   The Economist reported in March 2011 that U.S. manufacturing employment
   declined steadily from approximately 17 million in 2000 to under 12
   million in 2010.^[123] Comparing January 2008, the U.S. overall peak
   employment month across all industries pre-crisis, with October 2012,
   manufacturing employment was down 1.76 million.^[124] This is due to a
   combination of growing competition from lower-wage countries,
   automation/productivity improvements, off-shoring, etc.

   For example, China's share of global manufacturing increased from
   approximately 5% in 1996 to 12% in 2008. China represents roughly
   one-third of the U.S. trade deficit, nearly $295 billion in 2011.^[125]
   The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimated that from 2001-2011, 2.7
   million jobs were lost to China.^[126] USA Today reported in 2007 that
   an estimated one in six factory jobs (3.2 million) have disappeared
   from the U.S. since 2000, due to automation or off-shoring to countries
   like Mexico and China, where labor is cheaper.^[127]

   U.S. construction employment is heavily reliant on the housing market
   and new home construction. Measured from January 2008, construction
   employment was down 1.94 million as of October 2012. This follows a
   peak in construction employment due to the U.S. housing bubble
   throughout the mid-2000s, with a recent peak of approximately 7 million
   sustained during the 2005-2008 period.^[128]

   The total of the job losses in these two industries from January 2008
   to October 2012 was 3.7 million. For scale, the U.S. overall employment
   decline from January 2008 to October 2012 was a net 4.3 million, with
   8.8 million jobs lost from 1/08 to 2/10 and 4.5 million jobs added back
   thereafter.^[129]

   According to an American Bar Association report, After the JD, for the
   2000 graduating class of law students 24% of the surveyed lawyers were
   not practicing law in 2012, compared, to the same group, about 9%, who
   weren’t practicing law in 2003.^[130]^[131]

Unemployment benefits[edit]

   There is debate regarding the extent to which safety net programs such
   as unemployment insurance extend periods of unemployment by reducing
   the incentive to find work. The Heritage Foundation estimated in
   September 2011 that extending unemployment insurance increases the
   unemployment rate between 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points, advocating that
   such payouts be offset by other spending cuts.^[132] Economist Paul
   Krugman argued in July 2010 that with five job seekers for every job
   opening, "cutting off benefits to the unemployed will make them even
   more desperate for work — but they can't take jobs that aren't there."
   He also cited CBO reports indicating unemployment insurance is a highly
   effective form of stimulus, which he advocated in an economic
   downturn.^[133]

   The Congressional Budget Office provides periodic reports on
   unemployment insurance programs. The unemployment insurance (UI)
   program provides a weekly benefit to qualified workers who lose their
   job and are actively seeking work. The amount of that benefit is based
   in part on a workers past earnings. In particular, the periods for
   which eligible workers can receive UI benefits have been repeatedly
   extended during the 2008-2009 recession and its aftermath. Regular UI
   benefits generally last up to 26 weeks, but extensions were legislated
   extending this period significantly. From 2008-2012, these programs
   provided approximately $520 billion in benefits to recipients, which
   allowed households to better maintain their consumption. Far more
   workers were laid off in 2008 and 2009 than in 2006 and 2007. The
   number of workers who lost their job and started receiving UI benefits
   peaked at 14.4 million in 2009, whereas an average of roughly 8 million
   laid-off workers started receiving benefits in each fiscal year from
   2004 to 2007.^[134]

   Outlays for UI benefits totaled $120 billion in fiscal year 2009, a
   substantial increase over the amount two years earlier, which was $33
   billion. Spending on UI benefits in fiscal year 2010 was even higher
   than in fiscal year 2009, totaling nearly $160 billion. CBO projected
   in November 2010 that spending in fiscal year 2011 would be $93
   billion.^[135]

   In January 2014, the United States Senate began debating the Emergency
   Unemployment Compensation Extension Act (S. 1845; 113th Congress) on
   the Senate floor.^[136] The Emergency Unemployment Compensation
   Extension Act would extend federal emergency unemployment benefits for
   another three months, at a cost of $6.4 billion.^[137]

Employment of part-time workers versus full-time[edit]

   U.S. Full-Time and Part-Time Workers (in thousands).

   U.S. employers have shifted the composition of the workforce to more
   part-time workers versus full-time. The percentage of the workforce
   that is part-time has risen from approximately 17.0% in January 2000 to
   19.2% in May 2013. Employers do not have to pay some costly benefits to
   part-time workers and can vary payroll costs more easily to reflect
   economic conditions.^[138]

   Statistics regarding the number of full-time and part-time workers (in
   thousands) since 2000 highlight this trend:
     * From the November 2007 pre-crisis peak total employment month to
       December 2009 trough or low point, the U.S. lost 11,306 full-time
       jobs but added 2,704 part-time jobs, a net loss of 8,602 jobs
       total.
     * From the December 2009 crisis total employment trough to May 2013,
       the U.S. added 5,669 full-time jobs and added 237 part-time jobs, a
       total of 5,906 jobs.
     * From the November 2007 pre-crisis peak total employment month to
       May 2013, the U.S. lost 5,637 full-time jobs and added 2,941
       part-time jobs, a net loss of 2,696 jobs total.^[139]

Fiscal and monetary policy[edit]

   The Federal Reserve Holdings of Treasury and Mortgage-Backed
   Securities.

   Employment is both cause and response to the economic growth rate,
   which can be affected by both government fiscal policy (spending and
   tax decisions) and monetary policy (Federal Reserve action.)

Fiscal policy[edit]

   The U.S. has run historically large budget deficits since the 2008
   recession, adding over $1 trillion in debt annually since fiscal year
   2008. With a U.S. GDP of approximately $15 trillion, the spending
   implied by this deficit comprises a significant amount of GDP.
   Keynesian economics argues that when the economic growth is slow,
   larger budget deficits are stimulative to the economy. This is one
   reason why the significant deficit reduction represented by the fiscal
   cliff was expected to result in a recession.^[140]^[141]

Monetary policy[edit]

   The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken significant action to stimulate the
   economy after the 2008-2009 recession. The Fed expanded its balance
   sheet significantly from 2008-2012, meaning it essentially "printed
   money" to purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and
   U.S. treasury bonds. This bids up bond prices, helping keep interest
   rates low, to encourage companies to borrow and invest and people to
   buy homes. It signaled in 2012 this expansion will continue
   indefinitely. The Fed also tied its actions to its outlook for
   unemployment and inflation for the first time in December 2012.^[142]

Political debates[edit]

Liberal position[edit]

   Liberals typically argue for government action or partnership with the
   private sector to improve job creation. Typical proposals involve
   stimulus spending on infrastructure construction, clean energy
   investment, unemployment compensation, educational loan assistance, and
   retraining programs. Liberals historically supported labor unions and
   protectionist trade policies. Liberals tend to be less concerned with
   budget deficits and debt and have a higher tolerance for inflation or
   currency devaluation to improve trade competitiveness, as a weaker
   currency makes exports relatively less expensive. During recessions,
   liberals generally advocate solutions based on Keynesian economics,
   which argues for additional government spending when the private sector
   is unable or unwilling to support sufficient levels of economic
   growth.^[59]^[143]

Conservative position[edit]

   Conservatives typically argue for free market solutions, with less
   government restriction of the private sector. Conservatives tend to
   oppose stimulus spending or bailouts, letting the free market determine
   success and failure. Typical proposals involve deregulation and income
   tax rate reduction. Conservatives historically have opposed labor
   unions and encouraged free trade agreements. Fiscal conservatives
   express concern that higher budget deficits and debt damage confidence,
   reducing investment and spending. Conservatives argue for policies that
   reduce or lower inflation. Conservatives generally advocate supply-side
   economics.^[59]

Poll data[edit]

   The affluent are much less inclined than other groups of Americans to
   support an active role for government in addressing high unemployment.
   Only 19% of the wealthy say that Washington should insure that everyone
   who wants to work can find a job, but 68% of the general public support
   that proposition. Similarly, only 8% of the rich say that the federal
   government should provide jobs for everyone able and willing to work
   who cannot find a job in private employment, but 53% of the general
   public thinks it should. A September 2012 survey by The Economist found
   those earning over $100,000 annually were twice as likely to name the
   budget deficit as the most important issue in deciding how they would
   vote than middle- or lower-income respondents. Among the general
   public, about 40% say unemployment is the most important issue while
   25% say that the budget deficit is.^[144]

   A March 2011 Gallup poll reported: "One in four Americans say the best
   way to create more jobs in the U.S. is to keep manufacturing in this
   country and stop sending work overseas. Americans also suggest creating
   jobs by increasing infrastructure work, lowering taxes, helping small
   businesses, and reducing government regulation." Further, Gallup
   reported that: "Americans consistently say that jobs and the economy
   are the most important problems facing the country, with 26% citing
   jobs specifically as the nation's most important problem in March."
   Republicans and Democrats agreed that bringing the jobs home was the
   number one solution approach, but differed on other poll questions.
   Republicans next highest ranked items were lowering taxes and reducing
   regulation, while Democrats preferred infrastructure stimulus and more
   help for small businesses.^[4]

   Further, U.S. sentiment on free trade has been turning more negative.
   An October 2010 Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll reported that:
   "[M]ore than half of those surveyed, 53%, said free-trade agreements
   have hurt the U.S. That is up from 46% three years ago and 32% in
   1999." Among those earning $75,000 or more, 50% now say free-trade
   pacts have hurt the U.S., up from 24% who said the same in 1999. Across
   party lines, income, and job type, between 76-95% of Americans surveyed
   agreed that "outsourcing of production and manufacturing work to
   foreign countries is a reason the U.S. economy is struggling and more
   people aren't being hired." ^[145]

   The Pew Center reported poll results in August 2012: "Fully 85% of
   self-described middle-class adults say it is more difficult now than it
   was a decade ago for middle-class people to maintain their standard of
   living. Of those who feel this way, 62% say “a lot” of the blame lies
   with Congress, while 54% say the same about banks and financial
   institutions, 47% about large corporations, 44% about the Bush
   administration, 39% about foreign competition and 34% about the Obama
   administration."^[146]

2008-2009 debates[edit]

   The debate around the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
   (ARRA), the approximately $800 billion stimulus bill passed due to the
   subprime mortgage crisis, highlighted these views. Democrats generally
   advocated the liberal position and Republicans advocated the
   conservative position. Republican pressure reduced the overall size of
   the stimulus while increasing the ratio of tax cuts in the law.

   These historical positions were also expressed during the debate around
   the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized the
   Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), an approximately $700 billion
   bailout package (later reduced to $430 billion) for the banking
   industry. The initial attempt to pass the bill failed in the House of
   Representatives due primarily to Republican opposition.^[147] Following
   a significant drop in the stock market and pressure from a variety of
   sources, a second vote passed the bill in the House.

2010-present debates[edit]

Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act[edit]

   Senator Dick Durbin proposed a bill in 2010 called the "Creating
   American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act" that would have reduced tax
   advantages from relocating U.S. plants abroad and limited the ability
   to defer profits earned overseas. However, the bill was stalled in the
   Senate primarily due to Republican opposition. It was supported by the
   AFL-CIO but opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.^[148]^[149]

   The Congressional Research Service summarized the bill as follows:
   "Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act – Amends the Internal
   Revenue Code to: (1) exempt from employment taxes for a 24-month period
   employers who hire a employee who replaces another employee who is not
   a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and who performs
   similar duties overseas; (2) deny any tax deduction, deduction for
   loss, or tax credit for the cost of an American jobs offshoring
   transaction (defined as any transaction in which a taxpayer reduces or
   eliminates the operation of a trade or business in connection with the
   start-up or expansion of such trade or business outside the United
   States); and (3) eliminate the deferral of tax on income of a
   controlled foreign corporation attributable to property imported into
   the United States by such corporation or a related person, except for
   property exported before substantial use in the United States and for
   agricultural commodities not grown in the United States in commercially
   marketable quantities."^[150]

American Jobs Act[edit]

   President Barack Obama proposed the American Jobs Act in September
   2011, which included a variety of tax cuts and spending programs to
   stimulate job creation. The White House provided a fact sheet which
   summarized the key provisions of the $447 billion bill.^[151] However,
   neither the House nor the Senate has passed the legislation as of
   December 2012. President Obama stated in October 2011: "In the coming
   days, members of Congress will have to take a stand on whether they
   believe we should put teachers, construction workers, police officers
   and firefighters back on the job...They'll get a vote on whether they
   believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and
   middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for
   millionaires and billionaires."^[152]

Fiscal cliff[edit]

   Main article: United States fiscal cliff

   During 2012, there was significant debate regarding approximately $560
   billion in tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect
   in 2013, which would reduce the 2013 budget deficit roughly in half.
   Critics argued that with an employment crisis, such fiscal austerity
   was premature and misguided.^[5] The Congressional Budget Office
   projected that such sharp deficit reduction would likely cause the U.S.
   to enter recession in 2013, with the unemployment rate rising to 9%
   versus approximately 8% in 2012, costing over 1 million
   jobs.^[140]^[141] The fiscal cliff was partially addressed by the
   American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

Tax policy[edit]

Individual income taxes[edit]

   The historical record indicates that marginal income tax rate changes
   have little impact on job creation, economic growth or employment.
     * During the 1970s, marginal income tax rates were far higher than
       subsequent periods and the U.S. created 19.6 million net new jobs.
     * During the 1980s, marginal income tax rates were lowered and the
       U.S. created 18.3 million net new jobs.
     * During the 1990s, marginal income tax rates rose and the U.S.
       created 21.6 million net new jobs.
     * From 2000-2010, marginal income tax rates were lowered due to the
       Bush tax cuts and the U.S. created no net new jobs, with 7.5
       million created 2000-2007 before the 8.7 million lost during the
       2008-2010 period.^[153]^[154]^[155]^[156]^[157]

   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) wrote in March 2009:
   "Small business employment rose by an average of 2.3 percent (756,000
   jobs) per year during the Clinton years, when tax rates for high-income
   filers were set at very similar levels to those that would be
   reinstated under President Obama's budget. But during the Bush years,
   when the rates were lower, employment rose by just 1.0 percent (367,000
   jobs)."^[158] CBPP reported in September 2011 that both employment and
   GDP grew faster in the seven-year period following President Clinton's
   income tax rate increase of 1993, than a similar period after the Bush
   tax cuts of 2001.^[159]

Corporate income taxes[edit]

   Conservatives typically argue for lower U.S. tax income rates, arguing
   that it would encourage companies to hire more workers. Liberals have
   proposed legislation to tax corporations that offshore jobs and to
   limit corporate tax expenditures.

   U.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record levels during 2012
   while corporate tax revenue was below its historical average relative
   to GDP. For example, U.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record
   levels during the third quarter of 2012, at an annualized $1.75
   trillion.^[160] U.S. corporations paid approximately 1.2% GDP in taxes
   during 2011. This was below the 2.7% GDP level in 2007 pre-crisis and
   below the 1.8% historical average for the 1990-2011 period.^[161] In
   comparing corporate taxes, the Congressional Budget Office found in
   2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among OECD
   countries behind Japan and Germany. However, the U.S. ranked 27th
   lowest of 30 OECD countries in its collection of corporate taxes
   relative to GDP, at 1.8% vs. the average 2.5%.^[162]

Solutions for creating more U.S. jobs[edit]

   A variety of options for creating jobs exist, but these are strongly
   debated and often have tradeoffs in terms of additional government
   debt, adverse environmental impact, and impact on corporate
   profitability.^[163] Examples include infrastructure investment, tax
   reform, healthcare cost reduction, energy policy and carbon price
   certainty, reducing the cost to hire employees, education and training,
   deregulation, and trade policy. Authors Bittle & Johnson of Public
   agenda explained the pros and cons of 14 job creation arguments
   frequently discussed, several of which are summarized below by topic.
   These are hotly debated by experts from across the political
   spectrum.^[164]

Infrastructure investment[edit]

   Many experts advocate infrastructure investment, such as building roads
   and bridges and upgrading the electricity grid. Such investments have
   historically created or sustained millions of jobs, with the offset to
   higher state and federal budget deficits. In the wake of the 2008-2009
   recession, there were over 2 million fewer employed housing
   construction workers.^[164]

Tax policy[edit]

   Removing the threat of higher taxes embodied in the fiscal cliff may
   encourage consumers to spend and employers to expand their business and
   add jobs. The risk is higher national debt, which can slow the economy
   in the long-run. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 significantly
   reduced taxes relative to the full expiration of the Bush tax cuts.
   Lowering the costs of workers also encourages employers to hire more.
   This can be done via reducing existing Social Security or Medicare
   payroll taxes or by specific tax incentives for hiring additional
   workers. President Obama reduced the Social Security payroll tax on
   workers during the 2011-2012 period, which added an estimated $100
   billion to the deficit while leaving these funds with consumers to
   spend. The U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world,
   although U.S. corporations pay among the lowest amount relative to GDP
   due to loopholes. Reducing the rate and eliminating loopholes may make
   U.S. businesses more competitive, but may also add to the
   deficit.^[164] The Tax Policy Center estimated during 2012 that
   reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% would add $1 trillion
   to the debt over a decade, for example.^[165]

Lower healthcare costs[edit]

   Businesses are faced with paying the significant and rising healthcare
   costs of their employees. Many other countries do not burden
   businesses, but instead tax workers who pay the government for their
   healthcare. This significantly reduces the cost of hiring and
   maintaining the work force.^[164]

Energy policy and carbon price certainty[edit]

   Various studies place the cost of environmental regulations in the
   thousands of dollars per employee. Americans are split on whether
   protecting the environment or economic growth is a higher priority.
   Regulations that would add costs to petroleum and coal may slow the
   economy, although they would provide incentives for clean energy
   investment by addressing regulatory uncertainty regarding the price of
   carbon.^[164]

   President Obama advocated a series of clean energy policies during June
   2013. These included: Reducing carbon pollution from power plants;
   Continue expanding usage of clean energy; raising fuel economy
   standards; and energy conservation through more energy-efficient homes
   and businesses.^[166]

Employment policies and the minimum wage[edit]

   Raising the minimum wage would provide households with more money to
   spend, in an era with record corporate profits and a reluctance of
   corporations to invest. Critics argue raising employment costs deters
   hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000
   per year, below poverty level for some families.^[164] The New York
   Times editorial board wrote in August 2013: "As measured by the federal
   minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is
   lower paid today than at any time in modern memory. If the minimum wage
   had kept pace with inflation or average wages over the past nearly 50
   years, it would be about $10 an hour; if it had kept pace with the
   growth in average labor productivity, it would be about $17 an
   hour."^[167]

   President Obama advocated raising the minimum wage during February
   2013: "The President is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage
   from $7.25 to $9 in stages by the end of 2015 and index it to inflation
   thereafter, which would directly boost wages for 15 million workers and
   reduce poverty and inequality...A range of economic studies show that
   modestly raising the minimum wage increases earnings and reduces
   poverty without jeopardizing employment. In fact, leading economists
   like Lawrence Katz, Richard Freeman, and Laura Tyson and businesses
   like Costco, Wal-Mart, and Stride Rite have supported past increases to
   the minimum wage, in part because increasing worker productivity and
   purchasing power for consumers will also help the overall
   economy."^[168]

   The Economist wrote in December 2013: "A minimum wage, providing it is
   not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on
   jobs....America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one
   of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment
   from federal of state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none
   finds any serious damage."^[169]

   The U.S. minimum wage was last raised to $7.25 per hour in July
   2009.^[170] As of December 2013, there were 21 states with minimum
   wages above the Federal minimum, with the State of Washington the
   highest at $9.32. Ten states index their minimum wage to
   inflation.^[171]

   The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to
   $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an
   estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have
   higher pay. A smaller increase to $9.00 per hour would reduce
   employment by 100,000, while about 7.6 million workers would have
   higher pay.^[172]

Regulatory reform[edit]

   Regulatory costs on business start-ups and going concerns are
   significant. Requiring laws to have sunset provisions (end-dates) would
   help ensure only worthwhile regulations are renewed. New businesses
   account for about one-fifth of new jobs added. However, the number of
   new businesses starting each year dropped by 17% after the recession.
   Inc. magazine published 16 ideas to encourage new startups, including
   cutting red tape, approving micro-loans, allowing more immigration, and
   addressing tax uncertainty.^[164]

Education policy[edit]

   Education policy reform could make higher education more affordable and
   more attuned to job needs. Unemployment is considerably lower for those
   with a college education. However, college is increasingly
   unaffordable. Providing loans contingent on degrees focused on fields
   with worker shortages such as healthcare and accounting would address
   structural workforce imbalances (i.e., a skills mismatch).^[164]

Income inequality[edit]

   Further information: Income inequality in the United States

   Income inequality, expressed by wage stagnation for middle- and
   lower-income families coupled with a shift in income growth to the top
   earners, can adversely affect economic growth, as wealthier families
   tend to save more. The quality or pay of the job matters, not just
   creating more jobs. The union movement has declined considerably, one
   factor contributing to more income inequality and off-shoring.
   Reinvigorating the labor movement could help create more higher-paying
   jobs, shifting some of the economic pie back to workers from owners.
   However, by raising employment costs, employers may choose to hire
   fewer workers.^[164]

Trade policy[edit]

   Creating a level playing field with trading partners could help create
   more jobs in the U.S. Wage and living standard differentials and
   currency manipulation can make "free trade" something other than "fair
   trade." Requiring countries to allow their currencies to float freely
   on international markets would reduce significant trade deficits,
   adding jobs in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western
   Europe.^[164]

Long-term unemployment[edit]

   CBO reported several options for addressing long-term unemployment
   during February 2012. Two short-term options included policies to: 1)
   Reduce the marginal cost to businesses of adding employees; and 2) Tax
   policies targeted towards people most likely to spend the additional
   income, mainly those with lower income. Over the long-run, structural
   reforms such as programs to facilitate re-training workers or education
   assistance would be helpful.^[58]

President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness[edit]

   President Obama established the President’s Council on Jobs and
   Competitiveness in 2009. The Council released an interim report with a
   series of recommendations in October 2011. The report included five
   major initiatives to increase employment while improving
   competitiveness:
    1. Measures to accelerate investment into job-rich projects in
       infrastructure and energy development;
    2. A comprehensive drive to ignite entrepreneurship and accelerate the
       number and scale of young, small businesses and high-growth firms
       that produce an outsized share of America’s new jobs;
    3. A national investment initiative to boost jobs-creating inward
       investment in the United States, both from global firms
       headquartered elsewhere and from multinational corporations
       headquartered here;
    4. Ideas to simplify regulatory review and streamline project
       approvals to accelerate jobs and growth; and,
    5. Steps to ensure America has the talent in place to fill existing
       job openings as well as to boost future job creation.^[173]

U.S. employment history[edit]

2000-present[edit]

   See also: 2007–present recession in the United States
   U.S. Changes in Employment for Selected Time Periods.

   Job growth in the U.S. from 2000-2007 was slow by historical standards,
   with 9.2 million jobs created versus a range of approximately 18-20
   million in each of the preceding three decades. Including the impact of
   the 2008-2009 recession, job growth from 2000-2010 was only 2.2
   million.^[174]

   The U.S. economy was severely impacted by the subprime mortgage crisis.
   The U.S. unemployment rate rose steadily from 5% in January 2008 to a
   peak of 10% in October 2009. It has since fallen to 7.8% in September
   2012.^[175] The number unemployed rose from 7.6 million in January 2008
   to a peak of 15.4 million in October 2009. It has since fallen to 12.1
   million in September 2012.^[176]

   Monthly job losses began in February 2008 and peaked in January 2009,
   with over 800,000 jobs lost that month. Employment fell from 138.0
   million at peak employment in January 2008 to the trough of 129.2
   million in February 2010, a decline of 8.8 million jobs or 6.4% of the
   workforce.^[177]

   As part of the economic policy of Barack Obama, the United States
   Congress funded approximately $800 billion in spending and tax cuts via
   the February 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate
   the economy. Monthly job losses began slowing shortly thereafter. By
   March 2010, employment again began to rise. From March 2010 to
   September 2012, over 4.3 million jobs were added, with 24 consecutive
   months of employment increases from October 2010 to September 2012. As
   of September 2012, employment of 133.5 million remained 4.5 million
   below the pre-crisis peak in January 2008.^[177]

   However, despite decreases in job loss and the unemployment rate, the
   federal data has been criticized for excluding large numbers of people
   who would like to work but are not considered to be part of the labor
   force because they are not running an active job search and are not
   available for immediate employment.^[178]

   In 2009, there were six unemployed people, on average, for each
   available job.^[179] Men account for at least 7 of 10 workers who lost
   jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.^[180] The youth
   unemployment rate was 18.5% in July 2009, the highest July rate since
   1948.^[181] Approximately 34.5% of young African American men were
   unemployed in October 2009.^[182] As of 2009, Detroit's unemployment
   rate was 27%, but the Detroit News suggests that nearly half of the
   city's working-age population was unemployed.^[183] An estimated 3.8
   million Americans lost their jobs in 2009.^[179]

   A study by the Brookings Institution determined that the 2011
   employment rate for teens (ages 16–19) in the United States is
   25%.^[184] Comparing employment rates in 2000 vs. 2011, the Brookings
   Institution found that younger workers had much lower rates of
   employment (higher unemployment) while older workers had higher rates
   of employment (lower unemployment). Between 2000 and 2011, the
   employment rate for 16-19 year-olds fell from 44 to 24 percent, while
   the employment rate for those over 55 rose moderately. For those aged
   20–54, the rate of employment fell.^[185]

   Research indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted,
   with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic
   growth.^[186]^[187]

Analytical perspectives[edit]

   Analyzing the true state of the U.S. labor market is very complex and a
   challenge for leading economists, who may arrive at different
   conclusions. For example, the main gauge, the unemployment rate, can be
   falling (a positive sign) while the labor force participation rate is
   falling as well (a negative sign). Further, the reasons for persons
   leaving the labor force may not be clear, such as aging (more people
   retiring) or because they are discouraged and have stopped looking for
   work.^[188]

Slow labor market recovery following 2007-2009 recession[edit]

   CBO issued a report in February 2014 analyzing the causes for the slow
   labor market recovery following the 2007-2009 recession. CBO listed
   several major causes:
     * "To a large degree, the slow recovery of the labor market reflects
       the slow growth in the demand for goods and services, and hence
       gross domestic product (GDP). CBO estimates that GDP was 7½ percent
       smaller than potential (maximum sustainable) GDP at the end of the
       recession; by the end of 2013, less than one-half of that gap had
       been closed. With output growing so slowly, payrolls have increased
       slowly as well—and the slack in the labor market that can be seen
       in the elevated unemployment rate and part of the reduction in the
       rate of labor force participation mirrors the gap between actual
       and potential GDP."
     * "Of the roughly 2 percentage-point net increase in the rate of
       unemployment between the end of 2007 and the end of 2013, about 1
       percentage point was the result of cyclical weakness in the demand
       for goods and services, and about 1 percentage point arose from
       structural factors; those factors are chiefly the stigma workers
       face and the erosion of skills that can stem from long-term
       unemployment (together worth about one-half of a percentage point
       of increase in the unemployment rate) and a decrease in the
       efficiency with which employers are filling vacancies (probably at
       least in part as a result of mismatches in skills and locations,
       and also worth about one-half of a percentage point of the increase
       in the unemployment rate)."
     * "Of the roughly 3 percentage-point net decline in the labor force
       participation rate between the end of 2007 and the end of 2013,
       about 1½ percentage points was the result of long-term trends
       (primarily the aging of the population), about 1 percentage point
       was the result of temporary weakness in employment prospects and
       wages, and about one-half of a percentage point was attributable to
       unusual aspects of the slow recovery that led workers to become
       discouraged and permanently drop out of the labor force."
     * "Employment at the end of 2013 was about 6 million jobs short of
       where it would be if the unemployment rate had returned to its
       prerecession level and if the participation rate had risen to the
       level it would have attained without the current cyclical weakness.
       Those factors account roughly equally for the shortfall."^[189]

Employment growth 2000-present[edit]

   The U.S. economy created between 18-21 million jobs in each of the
   three decades from 1970-2000, an average of approximately 165,500/month
   during that span. From January 2000 to January 2008 (the pre-recession
   peak), job creation averaged 77,000 jobs/month. Excluding the early
   2000s recession, from January 2003-January 2008 the U.S. created
   128,000 jobs/month. During the Great Recession, 8.5 million jobs were
   lost from the peak in early 2008 to the trough in February 2010. By
   September 2012, approximately 4.3 million jobs were added back, still
   4.2 million below the pre-crisis peak. During 2011 and 2012, job
   creation averaged 153,000 and 151,000 jobs/month
   respectively.^[190]^[191]

What job creation rate is required to lower the unemployment rate?[edit]

Estimates[edit]

   Estimates vary for the number of jobs that must be created to absorb
   the inflow of persons into the labor force, to maintain a given rate of
   unemployment. This number is significantly affected by demographics and
   population growth. For example, economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson
   estimated this figure at 125,000 jobs per month during 2011.^[25]

   Economist Paul Krugman estimated it around 90,000 during 2012,
   mentioning also it used to be higher.^[192] One method of calculating
   this figure follows, using data as of September 2012: U.S. population
   314,484,000 x 0.90% annual population growth x 63% of population is
   working age x 63% work force participation rate / 12 months per year =
   93,614 jobs/month. This approximates the Krugman figure.

   Wells Fargo economists estimated the figure around 150,000 in January
   2013: "Over the past three months, labor force participation has
   averaged 63.7 percent, the same as the average for 2012. If the
   participation rate holds steady, how many new jobs are needed to lower
   the unemployment rate? The steady employment gains in recent months
   suggest a rough answer. The unemployment rate has been 7.9 percent, 7.8
   percent and 7.8 percent for the past three months, while the labor
   force participation rate has been 63.8 percent, 63.6 percent and 63.6
   percent. Meanwhile, job gains have averaged 151,000. Therefore, it
   appears that the magic number is something above 151,000 jobs per month
   to lower the unemployment rate."^[193] Reuters reported a figure of
   250,000 in February 2013, stating sustained job creation at this level
   would be needed to "significantly reduce the ranks of
   unemployed."^[194]

   Federal Reserve analysts estimated this figure around 80,000 in June
   2013: "According to our analysis, job growth of more than about 80,000
   jobs per month would put downward pressure on the unemployment rate,
   down significantly from 150,000 to 200,000 during the 1980s and 1990s.
   We expect this trend to fall to around 35,000 jobs per month from 2016
   through the remainder of the decade."^[195]

Empirical data[edit]

   During the 41 months from January 2010 to May 2013, there were 19
   months where the unemployment rate declined. On average, 179,000 jobs
   were created in those months. The median job creation during those
   months was 166,000.^[196]

How many jobs must be created to return to pre-recession levels?[edit]

   Answering this question involves understanding the current employment
   level relative to the pre-recession peak, as well as the jobs needed to
   address new labor force entrants as the population grows. U.S. total
   non-farm employment peaked at 138.1 million in January 2008. As of
   March 2013, employment was 135.2 million, a net loss of 2.9 million
   jobs. Employment fell from the peak in 1/2008 until 2/2010, then began
   to increase through early 2013.^[197]

   From January to November 2012, the U.S. added approximately 151,000
   jobs per month on average.^[22] Each month, The Hamilton Project
   examines the "jobs gap," which is the number of jobs that the U.S.
   economy needs to create in order to return to pre-recession employment
   levels while also absorbing the people who enter the labor force each
   month. Job creation would have to average 208,000 per month to close
   the gap by 2020; 320,000 by 2017; or 472,000 by mid-2015.^[23] During
   the prosperous 1990's decade, the U.S. created an average of 182,000
   jobs/month.^[22]

   Bloomberg reported that as of May 2013, the employment-to-population
   ratio for those aged 16–65 was 67.5%, well below the average of 72.5%
   in the decade preceding the recession that began in January 2008. This
   was approximately 10 million jobs short of the number that would exist
   at the average ratio.^[198]

Comparative size of labor force[edit]

   The U.S. civilian labor force was approximately 155 million people
   during October 2012.^[9] This was the world's third largest, behind
   China (795.5 million) and India (487.6 million). The entire European
   Union employed 228.3 million.^[199]

Comparison of employment recovery across recessions and financial
crises[edit]

   One method of analyzing the impact of recessions on employment is to
   measure the period of time it takes to return to the pre-recession
   employment peak. By this measure, the 2008-2009 recession was
   considerably worse than the five other U.S. recessions from 1970 to
   present. By May 2013, U.S. employment had reached 98% of its
   pre-recession peak after approximately 60 months.^[200] Employment
   recovery following a combined recession and financial crisis tends to
   be much longer than a typical recession. For example, it took Norway
   8.5 years to return to its pre-recession peak employment after its 1987
   financial crisis and it took Sweden 17.8 years after its 1991 financial
   crisis. The U.S. is recovering considerably faster than either of these
   countries.^[201]

Effect of disability recipients on labor force participation measures[edit]

   The number of people receiving Social Security disability benefits
   (SSDI) increased 22% to 8.7 million in April 2012 from 7.1 million in
   December 2007. Recipients are excluded from the labor force. Economists
   at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley estimated this explained as
   much as 0.5 of the 2.0 percentage point decline in the U.S. labor-force
   participation rate during the period.^[202]

Obtaining data[edit]

Monthly jobs reports[edit]

   U.S. employment statistics are reported by government and private
   primary sources monthly, which are widely quoted in the news media.
   These sources use a variety of sampling techniques that yield different
   measures.
     * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides a monthly
       "Employment Situation Summary." For example, BLS reported for
       December 2012 that: "Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 155,000 in
       December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.8
       percent...Employment increased in health care, food services and
       drinking places, construction, and manufacturing."^[203]
     * Automatic Data Processing (ADP) also provides a "National
       Employment Report." For the December 2012 period, ADP reported a
       215,000 non-farm payroll increase.^[204]

   Several secondary sources also interpret the primary data released.
     * The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities provides a monthly
       "Statement" on the BLS Situation Summary. The CBPP wrote in January
       2013: "[December 2012] is the 34th straight month of private-sector
       job creation, with payrolls growing by 5.3 million jobs (a pace of
       157,000 jobs a month) since February 2010; total nonfarm employment
       (private plus government jobs) has grown by 4.8 million jobs over
       the same period, or 141,000 a month. Total government jobs fell by
       546,000 over this period, dominated by a loss of 395,000 local
       government jobs."^[205]

Federal Reserve Database (FRED)[edit]

   The FRED database contains a variety of employment statistics organized
   as data series. It can be used to generate charts or download
   historical information. Data series include labor force, employment,
   unemployment, labor force participation, etc. The Bureau of Labor
   Statistics (BLS) also releases employment statistics. Some popular data
   series include:
     * FRED – Civilian Labor Force
     * FRED – Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate CIVPART
     * FRED – Civilian Unemployment Rate UNRATE
     * FRED – Civilian Unemployed UNEMPLOY

   Job creation in the U.S. is typically measured by changes in the "Total
   Non-Farm" employees.
     * FRED – Total Non-Farm Employment

   FRED has gathered many of the employment statistics on one page for
   easy access:
     * FRED-Unemployment Series

Unemployment rate forecasts[edit]

   The Congressional Budget Office provides an unemployment rate forecast
   in its long term budget outlook. During August 2012, it projected that
   the unemployment rate would be 8.8% in 2013 and 8.7% in 2014. CBO
   projected the rate would then begin falling steadily to 5.5% by 2018
   and remain around that level through 2022. This forecast assumes annual
   real GDP growth will exceed 3% between 2014 and 2018.^[206] During
   December 2012, Wells Fargo Economics forecast that the unemployment
   rate would be 7.8% in 2013 and 7.6% in 2014. This forecast assumes real
   GDP growth would be 1.4% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014.^[207]

Off-shoring statistics[edit]

   The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA)
   prepares an annual report on those petitioning for trade adjustment
   assistance, due to jobs lost from international trade. This represents
   a fraction of jobs actually off-shored and does not include jobs that
   are placed overseas initially or the collateral impact on surrounding
   businesses when, for example, a manufacturing plant moves overseas.
   During 2011, there were 98,379 workers covered by petitions filed with
   ETA.^[86] The figure was 280,873 in 2010,^[87] 201,053 in 2009 and
   126,633 in 2008.^[88]
