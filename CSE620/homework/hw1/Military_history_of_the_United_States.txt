   The military history of the United States spans a period of over two
   centuries. During those years, the United States evolved from a new
   nation fighting Great Britain for independence (1774–1781), through the
   monumental American Civil War (1861–65) to the world's sole remaining
   superpower of the late 20th century and early 21st century.^[1]

   U.S. military personnel and expenditures, 1790–2006. Personnel is shown
   in orange (left axis); expenditures are in teal (right axis). The two
   axes are scaled to visually align for World War II, thus showing the
   difference between the cost per soldier before and after President
   Dwight D. Eisenhower's "New Look" policy of the mid-1950s.^[2]

   The Continental Congress in 1775 established the Continental Army and
   named General George Washington its commander. This newly formed army,
   along with state militia forces, and the French army and navy, defeated
   the British in 1781. The new Constitution in 1789 made the president
   the commander in chief, with authority for the Congress to levy taxes,
   make the laws, and declare war.^[3]

   As of 2013, the U.S. military consists of an Army, Navy, Air Force and
   Marine Corps under the command of the United States Department of
   Defense. There also is the United States Coast Guard, which is
   controlled by the Department of Homeland Security.

   The President of the United States is the commander in chief, and
   exercises the authority through the Secretary of Defense and the
   Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which supervises combat
   operations. Governors have control of each state's Army and Air
   National Guard units for limited purposes. The president has the
   ability to federalize National Guard units, bringing them under the
   sole control of the Department of Defense.^[4]

Timeline[edit]

Colonial wars (1620–1774)[edit]

   Main article: Colonial American military history

   The beginning of the United States military lies in civilian frontier
   settlers, armed for hunting and basic survival in the wilderness. These
   were organized into local militias for small military operations,
   mostly against Native American tribes but also to resist possible raids
   by the small military forces of neighboring European colonies. They
   relied on the British regular army and navy for any serious military
   operation.^[5]

   In major operations outside the locality involved, the militia was not
   employed as a fighting force. Instead the colony asked for (and paid)
   volunteers, many of whom were also militia members.^[6]
   Siege of Louisbourg (1758)

   In the early years of the British colonization of North America,
   military action in the thirteen colonies that would become the United
   States were the result of conflicts with Native Americans, such as in
   the Pequot War of 1637, King Philip's War in 1675, the Yamasee War in
   1715 and Father Rale's War in 1722.

   Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a series of wars
   between Great Britain and France for control of North America, the most
   important of which were Queen Anne's War, in which the British
   conquered French colony Acadia, and the final French and Indian War
   (1754–1763) when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in
   North America. This final war was to give thousands of colonists,
   including Virginia colonel George Washington, military experience which
   they put to use during the American Revolution.^[7]

War of Independence (1775–1783)[edit]

   Main article: American Revolutionary War
   Detail from Washington and his Generals at Yorktown (c. 1781) by
   Charles Willson Peale. Lafayette (far left) is at Washington's right,
   the Comte de Rochambeau to his immediate left.

   Ongoing political tensions between Great Britain and the thirteen
   colonies reached a crisis in 1774 when the British placed the province
   of Massachusetts under martial law after the Patriots protested taxes
   they regarded as a violation of their constitutional rights as
   Englishmen. When shooting began at Lexington and Concord in April 1775,
   militia units from across New England rushed to Boston and bottled up
   the British in the city. The Continental Congress appointed George
   Washington as commander-in-chief of the newly created Continental Army,
   which was augmented throughout the war by colonial militia. He drove
   the British out of Boston but in late summer 1776 they returned to New
   York and nearly captured Washington's army. Meanwhile the
   revolutionaries expelled British officials from the 13 states, and
   declared themselves an independent nation on July 4, 1776.^[8]
   Washington's surprise crossing of the Delaware River in December 1776
   was a major comeback after the loss of New York City; his army defeated
   the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey.

   The British, for their part, lacked both a unified command and a clear
   strategy for winning. With the use of the Royal Navy, the British were
   able to capture coastal cities, but control of the countryside eluded
   them. A British sortie from Canada in 1777 ended with the disastrous
   surrender of a British army at Saratoga. With the coming in 1777 of
   General von Steuben, the training and discipline along Prussian lines
   began, and the Continental Army began to evolve into a modern force.
   France and Spain then entered the war against Great Britain as Allies
   of the US, ending its naval advantage and escalating the conflict into
   a world war. The Netherlands later joined France, and the British were
   outnumbered on land and sea in a world war, as they had no major allies
   apart from Indian tribes.

   A shift in focus to the southern American states in 1779 resulted in a
   string of victories for the British, but General Nathanael Greene
   engaged in guerrilla warfare and prevented them from making strategic
   headway. The main British army was surrounded by Washington's American
   and French forces at Yorktown in 1781, as the French fleet blocked a
   rescue by the Royal Navy. The British then sued for peace.

George Washington[edit]

   General George Washington (1732–1799) proved an excellent organizer and
   administrator, who worked successfully with Congress and the state
   governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and
   training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His
   biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states
   had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions,
   clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a
   battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British
   counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to
   win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies.
   Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and
   was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at
   Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to
   New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great
   majority of the population. The Loyalists, on whom the British had
   relied too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never
   were well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as
   the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November
   1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington astonished
   the world when, instead of seizing power, he retired quietly to his
   farm in Virginia.^[9]^[10]

   Patriots had a strong distrust of a permanent "standing army", so the
   Continental Army was quickly demobilized, with land grants to veterans.
   General Washington, who throughout the war deferred to elected
   officials, averted a potential coup d'état and resigned as
   commander-in-chief after the war, establishing a tradition of civil
   control of the U.S. military.^[11]

Early national period (1783–1812)[edit]

   Main articles: Northwest Indian War, Quasi-War, Barbary Wars,
   Tecumseh's War and Creek War

   Following the American Revolution, the United States faced potential
   military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier.
   The United States was a minor military power during this time, having
   only a modest army, navy, and marine corps. A traditional distrust of
   standing armies, combined with faith in the abilities of local militia,
   precluded the development of well-trained units and a professional
   officer corps. Jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy,
   fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United
   States in excessive foreign wars, and potentially allow a domestic
   tyrant to seize power.^[12]

   First Barbary War.

   In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution, the British had ceded the
   lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to
   the United States, without consulting the Shawnee, Cherokee, Choctaw
   and other smaller tribes who lived there. Because many of the tribes
   had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal
   leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing
   these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest
   Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the
   Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United
   States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington
   dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively
   defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in
   1794.^[13]

   When revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain in 1793, the
   United States sought to remain neutral, but the Jay Treaty, which was
   favorable to Great Britain, angered the French government, which viewed
   it as a violation of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance. French privateers
   began to seize U.S. vessels, which led to an undeclared "Quasi-War"
   between the two nations. Fought at sea from 1798 to 1800, the United
   States won a string of victories in the Caribbean. George Washington
   was called out of retirement to head a "provisional army" in case of
   invasion by France, but President John Adams managed to negotiate a
   truce, in which France agreed to terminate the prior alliance and cease
   its attacks.^[14]

Barbary wars[edit]

   Main articles: First Barbary War and Second Barbary War

   The Berbers along the Barbary Coast (modern day Libya) sent pirates to
   capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom. The U.S. paid
   protection money until 1801, when President Thomas Jefferson refused to
   pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the Barbary States, the First
   Barbary War followed. After the U.S.S. Philadelphia was captured in
   1803, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a raid which successfully burned
   the captured ship, preventing Tripoli from using or selling it. In
   1805, after William Eaton captured the city of Derna, Tripoli agreed to
   a peace treaty. The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S.
   shipping, until the Second Barbary War in 1815 ended the practice.^[15]

War of 1812[edit]

   "We have met the enemy and they are ours." Commodore Oliver Hazard
   Perry's victory on Lake Erie in 1813 was an important turning point in
   the War of 1812. (Painting by William H. Powell, 1865)
   Main article: War of 1812

   By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged
   during this era was the War of 1812.^[16] With Britain locked in a
   major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American
   shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while
   pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on
   American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain
   supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal
   of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion.
   The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812,
   the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of
   defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by
   invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a
   bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though
   concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's
   War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon
   in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid
   Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New
   Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger
   British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning
   of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake
   Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander
   killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided
   military battle that killed the top three British generals and
   thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the
   Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became
   president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more
   powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and
   Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never
   gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by
   Britain.^[17]

War with Mexico (1846–48)[edit]

   Main article: Mexican-American War
   American forces storming the "Halls of Montezuma"

   With the rapid expansion of the farming population, Democrats looked to
   the west for new lands, an idea which became known as "Manifest
   Destiny." In the Texas Revolution (1835–36), the settlers declared
   independence and defeated the Mexican army, but Mexico was determined
   to reconquer the lost province and threatened war with the U.S. if it
   annexed Texas. The U.S., much larger and more powerful, did annex Texas
   in 1845 and war broke out in 1846 over boundary issues.^[18]^[19]

   In the Mexican-American War 1846–48, the U.S. Army under Generals
   Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott and others, invaded and after a
   series of victorious battles (and no major defeats) seized New Mexico
   and California, and also blockaded the coast, invaded northern Mexico,
   and invaded central Mexico, capturing the national capital. The peace
   terms involved American purchase of the area from California to New
   Mexico for $10 million.^[20]

American Civil War (1861–1865)[edit]

   Main article: American Civil War
   Dead soldiers lie where they fell at Antietam, the bloodiest day in
   American history. Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation
   after this battle.

   Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of
   the Mason-Dixon Line and those south of it, primarily centered on the
   "peculiar institution" of slavery and the ability of states to overrule
   the decisions of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s,
   conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent.
   After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought
   would work to end slavery) states in the South seceded from the United
   States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861,
   forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America or
   simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was
   loyal to the Union.^[21]

   The American Civil War caught both sides unprepared. The Confederacy
   hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene, or else by
   wearing down the North's willingness to fight. The U.S. sought a quick
   victory focused on capturing the Confederate capital at Richmond,
   Virginia. The Confederates under Robert E. Lee tenaciously defended
   their capital until the very end. The war spilled across the continent,
   and even to the high seas. Most of the material and personnel of the
   South were used up, while the North prospered.

   The American Civil War is sometimes called the "first modern war" due
   to the mobilization (and destruction) of the civilian base. It also is
   characterized by many technical innovations involving railroads,
   telegraphs, rifles, trench warfare, and ironclad warships with turret
   guns.^[22]

Post-Civil War era (1865–1917)[edit]

Indian Wars (1865–1891)[edit]

   Main article: Indian Wars

   After the Civil War, population expansion, railroad construction, and
   the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on
   the Great Plains. Several tribes, especially the Sioux and Comanche,
   fiercely resisted confinement to reservations. The main role of the
   Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their
   wars against settlers and each other, William Tecumseh Sherman and
   Philip Sheridan were in charge. A famous victory for the Plains Nations
   was the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876, when Col. George
   Armstrong Custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th Cavalry were
   killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the Lakota,
   Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho nations. The last significant conflict
   came in 1891.^[23]

Spanish-American War (1898)[edit]

   Main article: Spanish-American War
   Charge by the Rough Riders

   The Spanish-American War was a short decisive war marked by quick,
   overwhelming American victories at sea and on land against Spain. The
   Navy was well-prepared and won laurels, even as politicians tried (and
   failed) to have it redeployed to defend East Coast cities against
   potential threats from the feeble Spanish fleet.^[24] The Army
   performed well in combat in Cuba. However, it was too oriented to small
   posts in the West and not as well-prepared for an overseas
   conflict.^[25] It relied on volunteers and state militia units, which
   faced logistical, training and food problems in the staging areas in
   Florida.^[26] The United States freed Cuba (after an occupation by the
   U.S. Army). By the peace treaty Spain ceded to the United States its
   colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.^[27] The Navy set
   up coaling stations there and in Hawaii (which voluntarily joined the
   U.S. in 1898). The U.S. Navy now had a major forward presence across
   the Pacific and (with the lease of Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba) a
   major base in the Caribbean guarding the approaches to the Gulf Coast
   and the Panama Canal.^[28]

Philippine-American War (1899–1902)[edit]

   Main article: Philippine–American War

   The Philippine-American War (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between a
   group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the
   ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of
   Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila. The Army sent in 100,000
   soldiers (mostly from the National Guard) under General Elwell Otis.
   Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899, the poorly
   armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands. The insurgency
   collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured
   by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies. Casualties
   included 1037 Americans killed in action and 3340 who died from
   disease; 20,000 rebels were killed.^[29]

Modernization[edit]

   The Navy was modernized in the 1880s, and by the 1890s had adopted the
   naval power strategy of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan—as indeed did every
   major navy. The old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel
   battleships, bringing them in line with the navies of Britain and
   Germany. In 1907, most of the Navy's battleships, with several support
   vessels, dubbed the Great White Fleet, were featured in a 14-month
   circumnavigation of the world. Ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt,
   it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy's capability to
   extend to the global theater.^[30]

   Secretary of War Elihu Root (1899–1904) led the modernization of the
   Army. His goal of a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a
   European-type general staff for planning was stymied by General Nelson
   A. Miles but did succeed in enlarging West Point and establishing the
   U.S. Army War College as well as the General Staff. Root changed the
   procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special
   branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating
   officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the Army's role
   in governing the new territories acquired in 1898 and worked out the
   procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, and wrote the charter
   of government for the Philippines.^[31]

   Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske was at the vanguard of new technology in
   naval guns and gunnery, thanks to his innovations in fire control
   1890–1910. He immediately grasped the potential for air power, and
   called for the development of a torpedo plane. Fiske, as aide for
   operations in 1913–15 to Assistant Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt,
   proposed a radical reorganization of the Navy to make it a war-fighting
   instrument. Fiske wanted to centralize authority in a chief of naval
   operations and an expert staff that would develop new strategies,
   oversee the construction of a larger fleet, coordinate war planning
   including force structure, mobilization plans, and industrial base, and
   ensure that the US Navy possessed the best possible war machines.
   Eventually, the Navy adopted his reforms and by 1915 started to
   reorganize for possible involvement in the World War then
   underway.^[32]

Banana Wars (1898–1935)[edit]

   Main article: Banana Wars

   "Banana Wars" is an informal term for the minor intervention in Latin
   America from 1898 until 1934. These include military presence in Cuba,
   Panama with the Panama Canal Zone, Haiti (1915–1935), Dominican
   Republic (1916–1924) and Nicaragua (1912–1925) & (1926–1933). The U.S.
   Marine Corps began to specialize in long-term military occupation of
   these countries, primarily to safeguard customs revenues which were the
   cause of local civil wars.^[33]

Moro Rebellion (1899–1913)[edit]

   Main article: Moro Rebellion

   The Moro Rebellion was an armed insurgency between Muslim Filipino
   tribes in the southern Philippines between 1899 and 1913. Pacification
   was never complete as sporadic antigovernment insurgency continues into
   the 21st century, with American advisors helping the Philippine
   government forces.^[34]

Mexico (1910–1919)[edit]

   Main article: Border War (1910–1919)
   U.S. enters Mexico in 1916 to punish Pancho Villa

   The Mexican Revolution involved a civil war with hundreds of thousands
   of deaths and large numbers fleeing combat zones. Tens of thousands
   fled to the U.S. President Wilson sent U.S. forces to occupy the
   Mexican city of Veracruz for six months in 1914. It was designed to
   show the U.S. was keenly interested in the civil war and would not
   tolerate attacks on Americans, especially the April 9, 1914, "Tampico
   Affair", which involved the arrest of American sailors by soldiers of
   the regime of Mexican President Victoriano Huerta.^[35] In early 1916
   Pancho Villa a Mexican general ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid
   on the American city of Columbus New Mexico, with the goal of robbing
   banks to fund his army.^[36] The German Secret Service encouraged
   Pancho Villa in his attacks to involve the United States in an
   intervention in Mexico which would distract the United States from its
   growing involvement in the war and divert aid from Europe to support
   the intervention.^[37] Wilson called up the state militias (National
   Guard) and sent them and the U.S. Army under General John J. Pershing
   to punish Villa in the Pancho Villa Expedition. Villa fled, with the
   Americans in pursuit deep into Mexico, thereby arousing Mexican
   nationalism. By early 1917 President Venustiano Carranza had contained
   Villa and secured the border, so Wilson ordered Pershing to
   withdraw.^[38]^[39]

World War I (1917–1918)[edit]

   Expeditionary Forces

   The United States originally wished to remain neutral when World War I
   broke out in August 1914. However, it insisted on its right as a
   neutral party to immunity from German submarine attack, even though its
   ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. In 1917 the Germans
   resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to American
   entry. When the U.S declared war, the U.S. army was still small by
   European standards and mobilization would take a year. Meanwhile the
   U.S. continued to provide supplies and money to Britain and France, and
   initiated the first peacetime draft.^[40] Industrial mobilization took
   longer than expected, so divisions were sent to Europe without
   equipment, relying instead on the British and French to supply
   them.^[41]

   By summer 1918, a million American soldiers, or "doughboys" as they
   were often called, of the American Expeditionary Forces were in Europe
   under the command of John J. Pershing, with 25,000 more arriving every
   week. The failure of Germany's spring offensive exhausted its reserves
   and they were unable to launch new offensives. The German Navy and home
   front then revolted and a new German government signed a conditional
   surrender, the Armistice, ending the war against the western front on
   November 11, 1918.^[42]

Russian Revolution[edit]

   The so-called Polar Bear Expedition was the involvement of U.S. troops,
   during the Russian Revolution, in blocking the Bolsheviks in
   Arkhangelsk, Russia in 1918 and 1919.

1920s: Naval disarmament[edit]

   Main article: Washington Naval Conference

   The U.S. sponsored a major world conference to limit the naval
   armaments of world powers, including the U.S., Britain, Japan, and
   France, plus smaller nations.^[43] Secretary of State Charles Evans
   Hughes made the key proposal of each country to reduce its number of
   warships by a formula that was accepted. The conference enabled the
   great powers to reduce their navies and avoid conflict in the Pacific.
   The treaties remained in effect for ten years, but were not renewed as
   tensions escalated.^[44]

1930s: Neutrality Acts[edit]

   After the costly U.S. involvement in World War I, isolationism grew
   within the nation. Congress refused membership in the League of
   Nations, and in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia, the
   gradually more restrictive Neutrality Acts were passed, which were
   intended to prevent the U.S. from supporting either side in a war.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to support Britain, however, and
   in 1940 signed the Lend-Lease Act, which permitted an expansion of the
   "cash and carry" arms trade to develop with Britain, which controlled
   the Atlantic sea lanes.

   Roosevelt favored the Navy (he was in effective charge in World War I),
   and used relief programs such as the PWA to support Navy yards and
   build warships. For example in 1933 he authorized $238 million in PWA
   funds for thirty-two new ships. The Army Air Corps received only $11
   million, which barely covered replacements and allowed no
   expansion.^[45]

World War II (1941–1945)[edit]

   II, United States Army Air Forces during World War II and Special
   relationship

   Starting in 1940 (18 months before Pearl Harbor), the nation mobilized,
   giving high priority to air power. American involvement in World War II
   in 1940-41 was limited to providing war material and financial support
   to Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. The U.S.
   entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the Japanese attack on
   Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese naval forces soon seized American,
   Dutch, and British possessions across the Pacific and Southeast Asia,
   except for Australia, which became a main American forward base along
   with Hawaii.
   The explosion aboard the USS Arizona during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

   The loss of eight battleships and 2,403 Americans^[46] at Pearl Harbor
   forced the U.S. to rely on its remaining aircraft carriers, which won a
   major victory over Japan at Midway just six months into the war, and on
   its growing submarine fleet. The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up
   with an island hopping campaign across the central and south Pacific in
   1943–45, reaching the outskirts of Japan in the Battle of Okinawa.
   During 1942 and 1943, the U.S. deployed millions of men and thousands
   of planes and tanks to the UK, beginning with the strategic bombing of
   Nazi Germany and occupied Europe and leading up to the Allied invasions
   of occupied North Africa in November 1942, Sicily and Italy in 1943,
   France in 1944, and the invasion of Germany in 1945, parallel with the
   Soviet invasion from the east. That led to the surrender of Nazi
   Germany in May 1945. In the Pacific, the U.S. experienced much success
   in naval campaigns during 1944, but bloody battles at Iwo Jima and
   Okinawa in 1945 led the U.S. to look for a way to end the war with
   minimal loss of American lives. The U.S. used atomic bombs on Hiroshima
   and Nagasaki to destroy the Japanese war effort and to shock the
   Japanese leadership, which quickly caused the surrender of Japan.

   The United States was able to mobilize quickly, eventually becoming the
   dominant military power in most theaters of the war (excepting only
   eastern Europe), and the industrial might of the U.S. economy became a
   major factor in the Allies' mobilization of resources. Strategic and
   tactical lessons learned by the U.S., such as the importance of air
   superiority and the dominance of the aircraft carrier in naval actions,
   continue to guide U.S. military doctrine into the 21st century.

   World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the
   country's greatest triumph, and the U.S. military personnel of World
   War II are frequently referred to as "the greatest generation." Over 16
   million served (about 11% of the population), and over 400,000 died
   during the war. The U.S. emerged as one of the two undisputed
   superpowers along with the Soviet Union, and unlike the Soviet Union,
   the U.S. homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war. During
   and following World War II, the United States and Britain developed an
   increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship.
   Manifestations of this include extensive basing of U.S. forces in the
   UK, shared intelligence, shared military technology (e.g. nuclear
   technology), and shared procurement.

Cold War era (1945–1991)[edit]

   Main article: Cold War

   Following World War II, the United States emerged as a global
   superpower vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in the Cold War. In this period
   of some forty years, the United States provided foreign military aid
   and direct involvement in proxy wars against the Soviet Union. It was
   the principal foreign actor in the Korean War and Vietnam War during
   this era. Nuclear weapons were held in ready by the United States under
   a concept of mutually assured destruction with the Soviet Union.

Postwar Military Reorganization (1947)[edit]

   The National Security Act of 1947, meeting the need for a military
   reorganization to complement the U.S. superpower role, combined and
   replaced the former Department of the Navy and War Department with a
   single cabinet-level Department of Defense. The act also created the
   National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Air
   Force.

Korean War (1950–1953)[edit]

   Main article: Korean War
   Beachhead at Inchon

   The Korean War was a conflict between the United States and its United
   Nations allies and the communist powers under influence of the Soviet
   Union (also a UN member nation) and the People's Republic of China
   (which later also gained UN membership). The principal combatants were
   North and South Korea. Principal allies of South Korea included the
   United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, although many
   other nations sent troops under the aegis of the United Nations. Allies
   of North Korea included the People's Republic of China, which supplied
   military forces, and the Soviet Union, which supplied combat advisors
   and aircraft pilots, as well as arms, for the Chinese and North Korean
   troops.^[47]

   The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck
   massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and
   ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened,
   naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces
   held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement.
   MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion
   well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the
   North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea.
   As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border
   with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and
   launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling
   back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback
   strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a
   Containment policy to split the country.^[48] MacArthur argued for
   rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over
   the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years
   until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear
   weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining
   divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in
   a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces
   remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign
   policy.^[49]

Lebanon crisis of 1958[edit]

   In the Lebanon crisis of 1958 that threatened civil war, Operation Blue
   Bat deployed several hundred Marines to bolster the pro-Western
   Lebanese government from July 15 to October 25, 1958.

Dominican Intervention[edit]

   Main article: Operation Power Pack

   On April 28, 1965, 400 Marines were landed in Santo Domingo to evacuate
   the American Embassy and foreign nationals after dissident Dominican
   armed forces attempted to overthrow the ruling civilian junta. By
   mid-May, peak strength of 23,850 U.S. soldiers, Marines, and Airmen
   were in the Dominican Republic and some 38 naval ships were positioned
   offshore. They evacuated nearly 6,500 men, women, and children of 46
   nations, and distributed more than 8 million tons of food.

Vietnam War (1964–1975)[edit]

   Main article: Vietnam War
   See also: United States Air Force in Thailand and Secret War

   The Vietnam War was a war fought between 1959 and 1975 on the ground in
   South Vietnam and bordering areas of Cambodia and Laos (see Secret War)
   and in the strategic bombing (see Operation Rolling Thunder) of North
   Vietnam. American advisors came in the late 1950s to help the RVN
   (Republic of Vietnam) combat Communist insurgents known as "Viet Cong."
   Major American military involvement began in 1964, after Congress
   provided President Lyndon B. Johnson with blanket approval for
   presidential use of force in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.^[50]

   Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the Republic
   of Vietnam (South Vietnam or the "RVN"), the United States,
   supplemented by South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the
   Philippines. The allies fought against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA)
   as well as the National Liberation Front (NLF, also known as Viet
   communists Viet Cong), or "VC", a guerrilla force within South Vietnam.
   The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the Soviet
   Union and China, turning Vietnam into a proxy war.^[51]

   The military history of the American side of the war involved different
   strategies over the years.^[52] The bombing campaigns of the Air Force
   were tightly controlled by the White House for political reasons, and
   until 1972 avoided the main Northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong and
   concentrated on bombing jungle supply trails, especially the Ho Chi
   Minh Trail.^[53] The most controversial Army commander was William
   Westmoreland whose strategy involved systematic defeat of all enemy
   forces in the field, despite heavy American casualties that alienated
   public opinion back home.^[54]
   United States Embassy following the Tet Offensive.

   The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of containment of
   Communism in south Asia, but American forces were frustrated by an
   inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles, corruption and
   incompetence in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, and ever
   increasing protests at home. The Tet Offensive in 1968, although a
   major military defeat for the NLF with half their forces eliminated,
   marked the psychological turning point in the war. With President
   Richard M. Nixon opposed to containment and more interested in
   achieving détente with both the Soviet Union and China, American policy
   shifted to "Vietnamization," – providing very large supplies of arms
   and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves. After more than
   57,000 dead and many more wounded, American forces withdrew in 1973
   with no clear victory, and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered
   by communist North Vietnam and unified.^[55]

   Memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in American
   politics. One side views the war as a necessary part of the Containment
   policy, which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of
   warfare. Others note the U.S. made major strategic gains as the
   Communists were defeated in Indonesia, and by 1972 both Moscow and
   Beijing were competing for American support, at the expense of their
   allies in Hanoi. Critics see the conflict as a "quagmire"—an endless
   waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern
   US interests. Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in
   foreign policy debates ever since.^[56] The draft became extremely
   unpopular, and President Nixon ended it in 1973,^[57] forcing the
   military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers. That
   raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected
   overall American society and values; the soldiers typically took the
   position that their service represented the highest and best American
   values.^[58]

Grenada[edit]

   In October, 1983, a violent power struggle threatened American lives in
   the small Caribbean nation of Grenada. Neighboring nations asked the
   U.S. to intervene. The invasion was a hurriedly devised grouping of
   paratroopers, Marines, Rangers, and special operations forces in
   Operation Urgent Fury. Over a thousand Americans quickly seized the
   entire island, taking hundreds of military and civilian prisoners,
   especially Cubans.^[59]^[60]

Beirut[edit]

   In 1983 fighting between Palestinian refugees and Lebanese factions
   reignited that nation's long-running civil war. A UN agreement brought
   an international force of peacekeepers to occupy Beirut and guarantee
   security. US Marines landed in August 1982 along with Italian and
   French forces. On October 23, 1983, a suicide bomber driving a truck
   filled with 6 tons of TNT crashed through a fence and destroyed the
   Marine barracks, killing 241 Marines; seconds later, a second bomber
   leveled a French barracks, killing 58. Subsequently the US Navy engaged
   in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon. While US President
   Ronald Reagan was initially defiant, political pressure at home
   eventually forced the withdrawal of the Marines in February 1984.^[61]

Libya[edit]

   Main article: Bombing of Libya (1986)

   Code-named "Operation El Dorado Canyon", comprised the joint United
   States Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps air-strikes against Libya on
   April 15, 1986. The attack was carried out in response to the 1986
   Berlin discotheque bombing, and resulted in the killing of 45 officers
   and 15 civilians.

Panama[edit]

   On December 20, 1989 the United States invaded Panama, mainly from U.S.
   bases within the then-Canal Zone, to oust dictator and international
   drug trafficker Manuel Noriega. American forces quickly overwhelmed the
   Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega was captured on January 3, 1990 and
   imprisoned in the U.S. and a new government was installed.^[62]

Post–Cold War era (1991–2001)[edit]

   US military engagements 1990–2002

Persian Gulf War (1990–1991)[edit]

   The Persian Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force
   of 34 nations led by the United States. The lead up to the war began
   with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with
   immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The
   coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a
   decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi
   forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low
   death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as
   "permanently disabled" according to the US Department of Veterans
   Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and
   ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia.
   Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi
   border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic
   targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi
   cities.^[63]

   Before the war, many observers believed the US and its allies could win
   but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any
   conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh
   desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II. After
   nearly 50 years of proxy wars, and constant fears of another war in
   Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, some thought the Persian Gulf
   War might finally answer the question of which military philosophy
   would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8
   years of war with Iran, and they were well-equipped with late model
   Soviet tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were
   crippled; in comparison, the US had no large-scale combat experience
   since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier, and major
   changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never
   been tested under fire.

   However, the battle was one-sided almost from the beginning. The
   reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military
   strategists and academics. There is general agreement that US
   technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale
   of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and
   tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted
   from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial
   strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities
   on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority
   almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few
   days, with some planes fleeing to Iran where they were interned for the
   duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of
   the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned
   the air war into a "turkey shoot". The heat signature of any tank which
   started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly
   destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft.
   Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they
   aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage
   and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a
   video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and
   helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not
   retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the
   time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops
   quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one
   instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera
   crew that was advancing with coalition forces.

   After just 100 hours of ground combat, and with all of Kuwait and much
   of southern Iraq under coalition control, US President George H. W.
   Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an
   agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were
   disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to
   Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; there is little doubt that
   coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired.
   Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have
   broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations
   refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a
   power vacuum and destabilize the region.^[64]

   Following the Persian Gulf War, to protect minority populations, the
   US, Britain, and France declared and maintained no-fly zones in
   northern and southern Iraq, which the Iraqi military frequently tested.
   The no-fly zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although
   France withdrew from participation in patrolling the no-fly zones in
   1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation.

Somalia[edit]

   Main articles: Operation Restore Hope and UNOSOM II

   US troops participated in a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia
   beginning in 1992. By 1993 the US troops were augmented with Rangers
   and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah
   Aidid, whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan. During a
   raid in downtown Mogadishu, US troops became trapped overnight by a
   general uprising in the Battle of Mogadishu. Eighteen American soldiers
   were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body
   of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob.
   Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000
   total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval,
   American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton. The
   incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and
   intervention. The book Black Hawk Down was written about the battle,
   and was the basis for the later movie of the same name.^[65]

Haiti[edit]

   Main article: Operation Uphold Democracy

   Operation Uphold Democracy (September 19, 1994 – March 31, 1995) was an
   intervention designed to reinstate the elected President Jean-Bertrand
   Aristide, who was reported to have died in office during the bombing of
   the presidential palace. The operation was effectively authorized by
   the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940.^[66]

Yugoslavia[edit]

   During the war in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the US operated in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO-led multinational
   implementation force (IFOR) in Operation Joint Endeavour . The USA was
   one of the NATO member countries who bombed Yugoslavia between March 24
   and June 9, 1999 during the Kosovo War and later contributed to the
   multinational force KFOR.^[67]

War on Terrorism (2001–present)[edit]

   The War on Terrorism is a global effort by the governments of several
   countries (primarily the United States and its principal allies) to
   neutralize international terrorist groups (primarily Islamic Extremist
   terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda) and ensure that countries
   considered by the US and some of its allies to be Rogue Nations no
   longer support terrorist activities. It has been adopted primarily as a
   response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.

Afghanistan[edit]

   horseback in November 2001

   The intervention in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom –
   Afghanistan) to depose that country's Taliban government and destroy
   training camps associated with al-Qaida is understood to have been the
   opening, and in many ways defining, campaign of the broader War on
   Terrorism. The emphasis on Special Operations Forces (SOF), political
   negotiation with autonomous military units, and the use of proxy
   militaries marked a significant change from prior U.S. military
   approaches.^[68]

Philippines[edit]

   In January 2002, the U.S. sent more than 1,200 troops (later raised to
   2,000) to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating
   terrorist groups linked to al-Qaida, such as Abu Sayyaf, under
   Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines. Operations have taken place
   mostly in the Sulu Archipelago, where terrorists and other groups are
   active. The majority of troops provide logistics; however, many are
   Special Forces troops that are training and assisting in combat
   operations against the terrorist groups.

Iraq[edit]

   Main article: History of Iraq (2003–11)

   After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American
   demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was
   refused, a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom
   fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Approximately
   250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000
   Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through
   their staging area in Kuwait. (Turkey had refused to permit its
   territory to be used for an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces
   also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia, estimated to number upwards of
   50,000. After approximately three weeks of fighting, Hussein and the
   Ba'ath Party were forcibly removed, followed by 9 years of military
   presence by the United States and the coalition fighting alongside the
   newly elected Iraqi government against various insurgent groups.

Libyan intervention[edit]

   Main article: Operation Odyssey Dawn

   As a result of the Libyan civil war, the United Nations enacted United
   Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone
   over Libya, and the protection of civilians from the forces of Muammar
   Gaddafi. The United States, along with Britain, France and several
   other nations, committed a coalition force against Gaddafi's forces. On
   19 March, the first U.S. action was taken when 114 Tomahawk missiles
   launched by US and UK warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the
   Gaddafi regime.^[69] The U.S. continued to play a major role in
   Operation Unified Protector, the NATO-directed mission that eventually
   incorporated all of the military coalition's actions in the theater.
   Throughout the conflict however, the U.S. maintained it was playing a
   supporting role only and was following the UN mandate to protect
   civilians, while the real conflict was between Gaddafi's loyalists and
   Libyan rebels fighting to depose him.^[70] During the conflict,
   American drones were also deployed.^[71]
