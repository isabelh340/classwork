   The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States
   Constitution deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes
   procedures both for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice
   President, as well as responding to Presidential disabilities. It
   supersedes the ambiguous wording of Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of
   the Constitution, which does not expressly state whether the Vice
   President becomes the President, as opposed to an Acting President, if
   the President dies, resigns, is removed from office or is otherwise
   unable to discharge the powers of the presidency.^[1] The Twenty-fifth
   Amendment was adopted on February 23, 1967.^[2]

     Section 1. In case of the removal of the President from office or of
     his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.

     Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice
     President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall
     take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of
     Congress.

     Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro
     tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
     Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to
     discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he
     transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers
     and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting
     President.

     Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the
     principal officers of the executive departments or of such other
     body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro
     tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
     Representatives their written declaration that the President is
     unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice
     President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the
     office as Acting President.

     Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro
     tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
     Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he
     shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice
     President and a majority of either the principal officers of the
     executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law
     provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of
     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their
     written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the
     powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the
     issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not
     in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of
     the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session,
     within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble,
     determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is
     unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice
     President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President;
     otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his
     office.^[3]

Background[edit]

   Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution states:

     In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his
     Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties
     of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President,
     and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death,
     Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President,
     declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer
     shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a
     President shall be elected.

   That clause was unclear regarding Presidential succession and
   inability; it did not state who had the power to declare a President
   incapacitated.^[1] Also, it did not provide a mechanism for filling a
   Vice Presidential vacancy prior to the next Presidential election. The
   vagueness of this clause caused difficulties many times before the
   Twenty-fifth Amendment's adoption:
     * In 1841, President William Henry Harrison became the first U.S.
       President to die in office. Representative John Williams had
       previously suggested that the Vice President should become Acting
       President upon the death of the President.^[4] John Tyler asserted
       that he had succeeded to the presidency, as opposed to only
       obtaining its powers and duties. He also declined to acknowledge
       documents referring to him as "Acting President". Although he felt
       his vice presidential oath negated the need for a second
       swearing-in, Tyler was persuaded to be formally sworn in in order
       to clear up any doubts about his right to the office. Having done
       so, he then moved into the White House and assumed full
       presidential powers. Tyler's claim was not formally challenged, and
       both houses of Congress adopted a resolution confirming that Tyler
       was the tenth President of the United States, without any
       qualifiers. The precedent of full succession was thus
       established.^[5] This became known as the "Tyler Precedent".

     * There had been occasions when a President was incapacitated. For
       example, following Woodrow Wilson's stroke no one officially
       assumed the Presidential powers and duties.^[1]

     * The office of Vice President had been vacant sixteen times due to
       the death or resignation of either the President or Vice
       President.^[1] For example, there was no Vice President for nearly
       four years after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

   All of these incidents made it evident that clearer guidelines were
   needed.^[1] There were two proposals for providing those guidelines.

Keating–Kefauver proposal[edit]

   In 1963, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York proposed a Constitutional
   amendment which would have enabled the Congress to enact legislation
   providing for how to determine when a President is disabled, rather
   than, as the Twenty-fifth Amendment does, having the Constitution so
   provide.^[6] This proposal was based upon a recommendation of the
   American Bar Association in 1960.^[7]

   The text of the proposal read:^[8]

     In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death
     or resignation, the said office shall devolve on the Vice President.
     In case of the inability of the President to discharge the powers
     and duties of the said office, the said powers and duties shall
     devolve on the Vice President, until the inability be removed. The
     Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death,
     resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President,
     declaring what officer shall then be President, or, in case of
     inability, act as President, and such officer shall be or act as
     President accordingly, until a President shall be elected or, in
     case of inability, until the inability shall be earlier removed. The
     commencement and termination of any inability shall be determined by
     such method as Congress shall by law provide.

   In the Senate, concerns were raised that the Congress could either
   abuse such authority^[9] or neglect to enact any such legislation after
   the adoption of this proposal.^[10] Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver
   (the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on
   Constitutional Amendments), a long-time advocate for addressing the
   disability question, spearheaded the effort until he died of a heart
   attack on August 10, 1963.^[11]^[12]

Kennedy assassination[edit]

   With President John F. Kennedy’s unexpected death, the need for a clear
   way to determine presidential succession, especially with the new
   reality of the Cold War and its frightening technologies,^[13] forced
   Congress into action.^[13] The new President, Lyndon Johnson, had once
   suffered a heart attack,^[14] and the next two people in line for the
   presidency were Speaker of the House John McCormack,^[15] who was 71
   years old,^[13] and Senate pro tempore Carl Hayden,^[15] who was 86
   years old.^[13] Senator Birch Bayh (Kefauver's successor as Chairman of
   the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments) tried to get a version
   of the Kefauver amendment approved in Congress in 1964,^[13] after
   Kennedy’s assassination.^[13] That first effort failed,^[13] but with
   President Lyndon Johnson’s support,^[13] the Keating–Kefauver proposal
   was proposed again right after Johnson’s inauguration in January
   1965.^[13]

Bayh–Celler proposal[edit]

   On January 6, 1965, Senator Bayh proposed in the Senate and
   Representative Emanuel Celler (Chairman of the House Judiciary
   Committee) proposed in the House of Representatives what would become
   the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Their proposal specified the process by
   which a President could be declared disabled, thereby making the Vice
   President an Acting President, and how the President could regain the
   powers of his office. Also, their proposal provided a way to fill a
   vacancy in the office of Vice President before the next presidential
   election. This was as opposed to the Keating–Kefauver proposal, which
   did not provide for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President
   prior to the next presidential election or itself provide a process for
   determining presidential disability. In 1964, the American Bar
   Association endorsed the type of proposal which Bayh and Celler
   advocated.^[16]

   On February 19, the Senate passed the amendment, but the House passed a
   different version of the amendment on April 13. On July 6, after a
   conference committee ironed out differences between the versions,^[17]
   the final version of the amendment was passed by both Houses of the
   Congress and presented to the states for ratification.^[18]

   Just six days after its submission, Nebraska and Wisconsin were the
   first states to ratify the amendment. On February 10, 1967, Minnesota
   and Nevada were the 37th and 38th states to ratify, respectively. On
   February 23, 1967, in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House,
   General Services Administrator Lawson Knott certified the amendment's
   adoption.

Effect[edit]

Section 1: Presidential succession[edit]

   John Tyler, the first to assume the Presidency following the death of a
   President. His legitimacy was initially contested, and it was unknown
   whether he should be considered merely an acting president.

   Section 1 codified the "Tyler Precedent" regarding when a President is
   removed from office, dies, or resigns. In any of these situations, the
   Vice President immediately becomes President.

Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy[edit]

   The Constitution did not provide for Vice Presidential vacancies until
   the Twenty-fifth Amendment was adopted. The Vice Presidency has been
   vacant several times due to death, resignation, or succession to the
   Presidency. Often these vacancies lasted for several years.

   Under Section 2, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Vice
   President, the President nominates a successor who becomes Vice
   President if confirmed by a majority vote of both Houses of the
   Congress.

Section 3: Presidential declaration[edit]

   Section 3 provides that when the President transmits a written
   declaration to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker
   of the House of Representatives, stating that he is unable to discharge
   the powers and duties of the Presidency, and until the President sends
   another written declaration to the aforementioned officers declaring
   himself able to resume discharging those powers and duties, the Vice
   President serves as Acting President.

Section 4: Vice Presidential–Cabinet declaration[edit]

   Section 4 is the only part of the amendment that has never been
   invoked.^[19] It allows the Vice President, together with a majority of
   either "the principal officers of the executive departments" (i.e., the
   Cabinet) or of "such other body as Congress may by law provide", to
   declare the President disabled by submitting a written declaration to
   the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
   Representatives. As with Section 3, the Vice President would become
   Acting President.

   Section 4 is meant to be invoked if the President's incapacitation
   prevents him from discharging the duties of his office and he does not
   provide a written declaration to that effect. The President may resume
   exercising the Presidential duties by sending a written declaration to
   the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House.

   Should the Vice President and Cabinet remain unsatisfied with the
   President's condition, they may within four days of the President's
   declaration submit another declaration that the President is
   incapacitated. The Congress must then assemble within 48 hours if not
   in session. Within 21 days of assembling or of receiving the second
   declaration by the Vice President and the Cabinet, a two-thirds vote of
   each House of Congress is required to affirm the President as unfit.
   Upon this finding by the Congress, Section 4 states that the Vice
   President would "continue" to be Acting President. Should the Congress
   resolve the issue in favor of the President, or if the Congress makes
   no decision within the 21 days allotted, then the President would
   "resume" discharging all of the powers and duties of his office. The
   use of the words "continue" and "resume" imply that the Vice President
   remains Acting President while Congress deliberates.

   However, the President may again submit a written declaration of
   recovery to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House.
   That declaration could be responded to by the Acting President and the
   Cabinet in the same way as stated earlier. The allotted 21-day
   Congressional procedure would start again.

Invocations[edit]

   Gerald Ford, after President Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to be Vice
   President
   (The White House, October 13, 1973)
   Further information: Invocations of 25th Amendment

   The Twenty-fifth Amendment has been invoked six times since its
   ratification. The first three times were applications of Sections 1 and
   2 in the context of scandals surrounding the Nixon Administration. The
   latter three were applications of Section 3 in connection to the
   President's undergoing a medical procedure requiring general
   anesthesia.

Appointment of Gerald Ford as Vice President (1973)[edit]

   On October 12, 1973, following Spiro Agnew's resignation two days
   earlier, President Richard Nixon nominated Representative Gerald Ford
   of Michigan to succeed Agnew as Vice President.

   The United States Senate voted 92–3 to confirm Ford on November 27 and,
   on December 6, the House of Representatives did the same by a vote of
   387–35. Ford was sworn in later that day before a joint session of the
   United States Congress.^[20]

Succession of Gerald Ford to Presidency (1974)[edit]

   Nixon's resignation letter, August 9, 1974.

   President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, resulting in Vice
   President Gerald Ford succeeding to the office of President.^[21]
   Gerald Ford is the only person ever to be Vice President, and later
   President, without being elected to either office.^[22]

Appointment of Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President (1974)[edit]

   (L-R): President Gerald Ford meeting with Vice President Nelson
   Rockefeller
   (in the Oval Office, March 12, 1975)

   When Gerald Ford became President, the Vice Presidency became vacant.
   On August 20, 1974, after having previously considered Melvin R. Laird
   and George H. W. Bush, President Ford nominated former New York
   Governor Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him as Vice President.

   On December 10, 1974, Rockefeller was confirmed 90–7 by the Senate. On
   December 19, 1974 Rockefeller was confirmed 287–128 by the House and
   sworn into office.^[20]

Acting President George H. W. Bush (1985)[edit]

   On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan underwent a colonoscopy,
   during which a pre-cancerous lesion called a villous adenoma was
   discovered. Upon being told by his physician (Dr. Edward Cattow) that
   he could undergo surgery immediately or in two to three weeks, Reagan
   elected to have it removed immediately.

   That afternoon, Reagan consulted with White House counsel Fred Fielding
   by telephone, debating whether to invoke the amendment and, if so,
   whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding
   and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan
   transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first
   specifically referencing Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the
   second did not. At 10:32 a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second
   letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required
   under the amendment.^[23]

   Books such as The President Has Been Shot: Confusion, Disability and
   the 25th Amendment, by Herbert Abrams, and Reagan's autobiography, An
   American Life, argue Reagan's intent to transfer power to Bush was
   clear. Fielding himself adds:

     I personally know he did intend to invoke the amendment, and he
     conveyed that to all of his staff and it was conveyed to the VP as
     well as the President of the Senate. He was also very firm in his
     wish not to create a precedent binding his successor.

Acting President Dick Cheney (2002, 2007)[edit]

   On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush underwent a colonoscopy and
   chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, temporarily transferring
   his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney. The medical procedure began
   at 7:09 a.m. EDT and ended at 7:29 a.m. EDT. Bush woke up twenty
   minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties
   until 9:24 a.m. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb,
   conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the
   additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. Unlike
   Reagan's 1985 letter, Bush's 2002 letter specifically cited Section 3
   as the authority for the transfer of power.

   On July 21, 2007, President Bush again invoked the amendment in
   response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, temporarily transferring
   his powers to Vice President Cheney. President Bush invoked Section 3
   at 7:16 a.m. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21 a.m. EDT. As happened
   in 2002, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the
   Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those
   powers.

Considered Section 4 invocations[edit]

   There are two documented instances in which invocation of Section 4 of
   the Twenty-fifth Amendment was considered, both of which involved the
   40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.

1981: Reagan assassination attempt[edit]

   Following the assassination attempt on President Reagan on March 30,
   1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush did not assume the role of
   acting president under Section 4. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary
   sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should
   have been invoked.^[24] Reagan was unable to invoke Section 3, because
   he was in surgery. Bush did not invoke Section 4, because he was on a
   plane returning from Texas. By the time Bush had arrived in Washington,
   Reagan was out of surgery.^[25]

1987: Reagan's alleged incapacity[edit]

   Upon assuming the role of White House Chief of Staff in 1987, Howard
   Baker was advised by his predecessor's staff to be prepared for a
   possible invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment due to Reagan's
   perceived laziness and ineptitude.

   According to the PBS program American Experience,

          "What Baker's transition team was told by Donald Regan's staff
          that weekend shocked them. Reagan was 'inattentive, inept,' and
          'lazy,' and Baker should be prepared to invoke the 25th
          Amendment to relieve him of his duties."

   Reagan biographer Edmund Morris stated in an interview aired on the
   program,

          "The incoming Baker people all decided to have a meeting with
          him on Monday, their first official meeting with the President,
          and to cluster around the table in the Cabinet room and watch
          him very, very closely to see how he behaved, to see if he was
          indeed losing his mental grip."

   Morris went on to explain,

          "...Reagan who was, of course, completely unaware that they were
          launching a death watch on him, came in stimulated by the press
