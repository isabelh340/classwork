   When to date the start of the history of the United States is debated
   among historians. Older textbooks start with the arrival of Christopher
   Columbus in 1492 and emphasize the European background, or they start
   in 1600 and emphasize the American frontier. In recent decades American
   schools and universities typically have shifted back in time to include
   more on the colonial period and much more on the prehistory of the
   Native peoples.^[1]^[2]

   Indigenous peoples lived in what is now the United States for thousands
   of years and developed complex cultures before European colonists began
   to arrive, mostly from England, after 1600. The Spanish had small
   settlements in Florida and the Southwest, and the French along the
   Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. By the 1770s, thirteen British
   colonies contained two and a half million people along the Atlantic
   coast east of the Appalachian Mountains. In the 1760s British
   government imposed a series of new taxes while rejecting the American
   argument that any new taxes had to be approved by the people. Tax
   resistance, especially the Boston Tea Party (1774), led to punitive
   laws (the Intolerable Acts) by Parliament designed to end
   self-government in Massachusetts. American Patriots (as they were
   called at the time as a term of ridicule) adhered to a political
   ideology called republicanism that emphasized civic duty, virtue, and
   opposition to corruption, fancy luxuries and aristocracy.

   All thirteen colonies united in a Congress that called on the colonies
   to write new state constitutions. After armed conflict began in
   Massachusetts, Patriots drove the royal officials out of every colony
   and assembled in mass meetings and conventions. Those Patriot
   governments in the colonies then unanimously empowered their delegates
   to Congress to declare independence. In 1776, Congress created an
   independent nation, the United States of America. With large-scale
   military and financial support from France and military leadership by
   General George Washington, the American Patriots won the Revolutionary
   War. The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the
   Mississippi River (except Florida and Canada). The central government
   established by the Articles of Confederation proved ineffectual at
   providing stability, as it had no authority to collect taxes and had no
   executive officer. Congress called a convention to meet secretly in
   Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation. It wrote
   a a new Constitution, which was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a Bill of
   Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights. With Washington as
   the Union's first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief political
   and financial adviser, a strong central government was created. When
   Thomas Jefferson became president he purchased the Louisiana Territory
   from France, doubling the size of the US. A second and last war with
   Britain was fought in 1812.

   Encouraged by the notion of Manifest Destiny, federal territory
   expanded all the way to the Pacific. The expansion was driven by a
   quest for inexpensive land for yeoman farmers and slave owners. The
   expansion of slavery was increasingly controversial and fueled
   political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by
   compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states north of the
   Mason–Dixon line by 1804, but the South continued to profit off the
   institution, producing high-value cotton exports to feed increasing
   high demand in Europe. The 1860 presidential election of Republican
   Abraham Lincoln was on a platform of ending the expansion of slavery
   and putting it on a path to extinction. Seven cotton-based deep South
   slave states seceded and later founded the Confederacy months before
   Lincoln's inauguration. No nation ever recognized the Confederacy, but
   it opened the war by attacking Fort Sumter in 1861. A surge of
   nationalist outrage in the North fueled a long, intense American Civil
   War (1861-1865). It was fought largely in the South as the overwhelming
   material and manpower advantages of the North proved decisive in a long
   war. The war's result was restoration of the Union, the impoverishment
   of the South, and the abolition of slavery. In the Reconstruction era
   (1863–1877), legal and voting rights were extended to the freed slave.
   The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the
   Fourteenth Amendment, it gained the explicit duty to protect individual
   rights. However, when white Democrats regained their power in the South
   during the 1870s, often by paramilitary suppression of voting, they
   passed Jim Crow laws to maintain white supremacy, and new
   disfranchising constitutions that prevented most African Americans and
   many poor whites from voting, a situation that continued for decades
   until gains of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and passage of
   federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights.

   The United States became the world's leading industrial power at the
   turn of the 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the
   Northeast and Midwest and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers
   and farmers from Europe. The national railroad network was completed
   with the work of Chinese immigrants and large-scale mining and
   factories industrialized the Northeast and Midwest. Mass
   dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency and traditional politics
   stimulated the Progressive movement, from the 1890s to 1920s, which led
   to many social and political reforms. In 1920, the 19th Amendment to
   the Constitution guaranteed women's suffrage (right to vote). This
   followed the 16th and 17th amendments in 1909 and 1912, which
   established the first national income tax and direct election of US
   senators to Congress. Initially neutral during World War I, the US
   declared war on Germany in 1917 and later funded the Allied victory the
   following year. After a prosperous decade in the 1920s, the Wall Street
   Crash of 1929 marked the onset of the decade-long world-wide Great
   Depression. Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt ended the
   Republican dominance of the White House and implemented his New Deal
   programs for relief, recovery, and reform. The New Deal, which defined
   modern American liberalism, included relief for the unemployed, support
   for farmers, Social Security and a minimum wage. After the Japanese
   attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States later
   entered World War II along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and the
   smaller Allies. The U.S. financed the Allied war effort and helped
   defeat Nazi Germany in Europe and defeated Imperial Japan in the
   Pacific War by detonating newly invented atomic bombs on enemy targets.

   The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as rival superpowers
   after World War II. During the Cold War, the US and the USSR confronted
   with each other indirectly in the arms race, the Space Race, proxy
   wars, and propaganda campaigns. US foreign policy during the Cold War
   was built around the support of Western Europe and Japan along with the
   policy of "containment" or stopping the spread of communism. The US
   joined the wars in Korea and Vietnam to try to stop its spread. In the
   1960s, in large part due to the strength of the civil rights movement,
   another wave of social reforms were enacted by enforcing the
   constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to
   African-Americans and other racial minorities. Native American activism
   also rose. The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union officially
   dissolved in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only
   superpower. As the 21st century began, international conflict centered
   around the Middle East following the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda
   on the United States in 2001. In 2008, the United States had its worst
   economic crisis since the Great Depression, which has been followed by
   slower than usual rates of economic growth during the 2010s.

Pre-Columbian era[edit]

   Main articles: Prehistory of the United States and Pre-Columbian era
   See also: Native Americans in the United States

   It is not definitively known how or when the Native Americans first
   settled the Americas and the present-day United States. The prevailing
   theory proposes that people migrated from Eurasia across Beringia, a
   land bridge that connected Siberia to present-day Alaska during the Ice
   Age, and then spread southward throughout the Americas and possibly
   going as far south as the Antarctic peninsula. This migration may have
   begun as early as 30,000 years ago^[3] and continued through to about
   10,000+ years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising
   sea level caused by the ending of the last glacial period.^[4] These
   early inhabitants, called Paleoamericans, soon diversified into many
   hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.

   The pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the
   history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of
   significant European influences on the American continents, spanning
   the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to
   European colonization during the Early Modern period. While technically
   referring to the era before Christopher Columbus' voyages of 1492 to
   1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of American
   indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly
   influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or even
   centuries after Columbus' initial landing.

Colonial period[edit]

   The Spanish conquistador Coronado explored parts of the American
   Southwest from 1540 to 1542.
   Main article: Colonial history of the United States

   After a period of exploration sponsored by major European nations, the
   first successful English settlement was established in 1607.^[5]
   Europeans brought horses, cattle, and hogs to the Americas and, in
   turn, took back to Europe maize, turkeys, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and
   squash. Many explorers and early settlers died after being exposed to
   new diseases in the Americas. The effects of new Eurasian diseases
   carried by the colonists, especially smallpox and measles, were much
   worse for the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. They
   suffered epidemics and died in very large numbers, usually before
   large-scale European settlement began. Their societies were disrupted
   and hollowed out by the scale of deaths.^[6]^[7]

Spanish, Dutch, and French colonization[edit]

   Juan Ponce de León (Santervás de Campos, Valladolid, Spain). He was the
   first European to arrive to the current U.S., leading the first
   European expedition to Florida, which he named.

   of the Americas and French colonization of the Americas

   Spanish explorers were the first Europeans with Christopher Columbus'
   second expedition, which reached Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493;
   others reached Florida in 1513.^[8] Spanish expeditions quickly reached
   the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon^[9]
   and the Great Plains. In 1540, Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive
   exploration of Southeast. That same year, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado
   explored from Arizona to central Kansas.^[10] Small Spanish settlements
   eventually grew to become important cities, such as San Antonio, Texas,
   Albuquerque, New Mexico, Tucson, Arizona, Los Angeles, California, and
   San Francisco, California. ^[11]

   New Netherland was a 17th-century Dutch colony centered on present-day
   New York City and the Hudson River Valley; the Dutch traded furs with
   the Native Americans to the north. The colony served as a barrier to
   expansion from New England. Despite being Calvinists and building the
   Reformed Church in America, the Dutch were tolerant of other religions
   and cultures. The colony, which was taken over by Britain in 1664, left
   an enduring legacy on American cultural and political life; this
   includes secular broadmindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city
   as well as rural traditionalism in the countryside (typified by the
   story of Rip Van Winkle). Notable Americans of Dutch descent include
   Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor
   Roosevelt and the Frelinghuysens.^[12]

   New France was the area colonized by France from 1534 to 1763. There
   were few permanent settlers outside Quebec and Acadia, but the French
   had far-reaching trading relationships with Native Americans throughout
   the Great Lakes and Midwest. French villages along the Mississippi and
   Illinois rivers were based in farming communities that served as a
   granary for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations
   in Louisiana along with settling New Orleans, Mobile and Biloxi.

   The Wabanaki Confederacy were military allies of New France through the
   four French and Indian Wars while the British colonies were allied with
   the Iroquois Confederacy. During the French and Indian War – the North
   American theater of the Seven Years' War – New England fought
   successfully against French Acadia. The British removed Acadians from
   Acadia (Nova Scotia) and replaced them with New England Planters.^[13]
   Eventually, some Acadians resettled in Louisiana, where they developed
   a distinctive rural Cajun culture that still exists. They became
   American citizens in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase.^[14] Other
   French villages along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers were absorbed
   when the Americans started arriving after 1770, or settlers moved west
   to escape them.^[15] French influence and language in New Orleans,
   Louisiana and the Gulf Coast was more enduring; New Orleans was notable
   for its large population of free people of color before the Civil War.

British colonization[edit]

   The Mayflower, which transported Pilgrims to the New World. During the
   first winter at Plymouth, about half of the Pilgrims died.^[16]

   The strip of land along the eastern seacoast was settled primarily by
   English colonists in the 17th century along with much smaller numbers
   of Dutch and Swedes. Colonial America was defined by a severe labor
   shortage that employed forms of unfree labor such as slavery and
   indentured servitude and by a British policy of benign neglect
   (salutary neglect). Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial
   America arrived as indentured servants.^[17] Salutary neglect permitted
   the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its
   European founders.^[18]

   The first successful English colony, Jamestown, was established in 1607
   on the James River in Virginia. Jamestown languished for decades until
   a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and established
   commercial agriculture based on tobacco. Between the late 1610s and the
   Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to their
   American colonies.^[19] A severe instance of conflict was the 1622
   Powhatan uprising in Virginia in which Native Americans killed hundreds
   of English settlers. The largest conflicts between Native Americans and
   English settlers in the 17th century were King Philip's War in New
   England^[20] and the Yamasee War in South Carolina.^[21]
   The massacre of Jamestown settlers in 1622. Soon the colonists in the
   South feared all natives as enemies.

   New England was initially settled primarily by Puritans. The Pilgrims
   established a settlement in 1620 at Plymouth Colony, which was followed
   by the established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. The Middle
   Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of New York, New Jersey,
   Pennsylvania, and Delaware, were characterized by a large degree of
   diversity. The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was
   the Province of Carolina, with Georgia Colony – the last of the
   Thirteen Colonies – established in 1733.^[22]

   The colonies were characterized by religious diversity, with many
   Congregationalists in New England, German and Dutch Reformed in the
   Middle Colonies, Catholics in Maryland, and Scots-Irish Presbyterians
   on the frontier. Sephardic Jews were among early settlers in cities of
   New England and the South. Many immigrants arrived as religious
   refugees: French Huguenots settled in New York, Virginia and the
   Carolinas. Many royal officials and merchants were Anglicans.^[23]

   Religiosity expanded greatly after the First Great Awakening, a
   religious revival in the 1740s led by preachers such as Jonathan
   Edwards and George Whitefield. American Evangelicals affected by the
   Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit
   and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for
   God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly
   created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for
   the Second Great Awakening beginning in the late 1790s.^[24] In the
   early stages, evangelicals in the South such as Methodists and Baptists
   preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted
   many slaves and recognized some as preachers.

   Each of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental
   structure. Typically a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from
   London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a
   locally elected legislature to vote taxes and make laws. By the 18th
   century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of
   low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The
   colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady
   flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured
   servants. The tobacco and rice plantations imported African slaves for
   labor from the British colonies in the West Indies, and by the 1770s
   African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population. The
   question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the
   colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish
   powers; those threats were gone by 1765. London regarded the American
   colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country. This policy
   is known as mercantilism.^[25]

18th century[edit]

Political integration and autonomy[edit]

   Join, or Die: This 1756 political cartoon by Benjamin Franklin urged
   the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.

   The French and Indian War (1754–63) was a watershed event in the
   political development of the colonies. It was also part of the larger
   Seven Years' War. The influence of the main rivals of the British Crown
   in the colonies and Canada, the French and North American Indians, was
   significantly reduced which U.S territory expanded into New France that
   was between the Thirteen Colonies and Louisiana. Moreover, the war
   effort resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as
   reflected in the Albany Congress and symbolized by Benjamin Franklin's
   call for the colonies to "Join or Die". Franklin was a man of many
   inventions – one of which was the concept of a United States of
   America, which emerged after 1765 and was realized in July 1776.^[26]

   Following Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America,
   King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 with the goal of
   organizing the new North American empire and protecting the native
   Indians from colonial expansion into western lands beyond the
   Appalachian Mountains. In ensuing years, strains developed in the
   relations between the colonists and the Crown. The British Parliament
   passed the Stamp Act of 1765, imposing a tax on the colonies without
   going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did
   Parliament have this right to tax Americans who were not represented in
   it? Crying "No taxation without representation", the colonists refused
   to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early
   1770s.^[27]

   1846 painting of the 1773 Boston Tea Party.

   The Boston Tea Party in 1773 was a direct action by activists in the
   town of Boston to protest against the new tax on tea. Parliament
   quickly responded the next year with the Coercive Acts, stripping
   Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it
   under army rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen
   colonies. Patriot leaders from all 13 colonies convened the First
   Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance to the Coercive
   Acts. The Congress called for a boycott of British trade, published a
   list of rights and grievances, and petitioned the king for redress of
   those grievances.^[28] The appeal to the Crown had no effect, and so
   the Second Continental Congress was convened in 1775 to organize the
   defense of the colonies against the British Army.

   Ordinary folk became insurgents against the British even though they
   were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They
   held very strongly a sense of ”rights” that they felt the British were
   deliberately violating – rights that stressed local autonomy, fair
   dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the
   issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the arrival in Boston of
   the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense
   of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge. They had
   faith that God was on their side.^[29]

   The American Revolutionary War began at Concord and Lexington in April
   1775 when the British tried to seize ammunition supplies and arrest the
   Patriot leaders.

   In terms of political values, the Americans were largely united on a
   concept called Republicanism, that rejected aristocracy and emphasized
   civic duty and a fear of corruption. For the Founding Fathers,
   according to one team of historians, "republicanism represented more
   than a particular form of government. It was a way of life, a core
   ideology, an uncompromising commitment to liberty, and a total
   rejection of aristocracy." ^[30]

American Revolution[edit]

   Main articles: American Revolution and History of the United States
   (1776–89)
   Washington's surprise crossing of the Delaware River in Dec. 1776 was a
   major comeback after the loss of New York City; his army defeated the
   British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey.

   The Thirteen Colonies began a rebellion against British rule in 1775
   and proclaimed their independence in 1776 as the United States of
   America. In the American Revolutionary War (1775–83) the American
   capture of the British invasion army at Saratoga in 1777 secured the
   Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with
   the United States. France brought in Spain and the Netherlands, thus
   balancing the military and naval forces on each side as Britain had no
   allies.^[31]

   General George Washington (1732–99) proved an excellent organizer and
   administrator, who worked successfully with Congress and the state
   governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and
   training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His
   biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states
   had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions,
   clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.

   As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his
   British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of
   how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion
   armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in
   1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third
   armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British
   control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control
   of the great majority of the population.^[32]

   The Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised
   about 20% of the population but never were well organized. As the war
   ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly
   sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist
   leadership with them. Washington astonished the world when, instead of
   seizing power for himself, he retired quietly to his farm in
   Virginia.^[32] Political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset observes, "The
   United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against
   colonial rule. In this sense, it was the first 'new nation'."^[33]
   Trumbull's Declaration of Independence

   On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in
   Philadelphia, declared the independence of "the United States of
   America" in the Declaration of Independence. July 4 is celebrated as
   the nation's birthday. The new nation was founded on Enlightenment
   ideals of liberalism in what Thomas Jefferson called the unalienable
   rights to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness", and dedicated
   strongly to republican principles. Republicanism emphasized the people
   are sovereign (not hereditary kings), demanded civic duty, feared
   corruption, and rejected any aristocracy.^[34]

Confederation and Constitution[edit]

   Further information: Articles of Confederation and History of the
   United States Constitution

   In the 1780s the national government was able to settle the issue of
   the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress and
   became territories; with the migration of settlers to the Northwest,
   soon they became states. Nationalists worried that the new nation was
   too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts
   such as the Shays' Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts. Nationalists –
   most of them war veterans – organized in every state and convinced
   Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. The delegates
   from every state wrote a new Constitution that created a much more
   powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president,
   and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing
   republican ideals of guarantees of individual liberty and of
   constraining the power of government through a system of separation of
   powers.^[35]

   The Congress was given authority to ban the international slave trade
   after 20 years (which it did in 1807). A compromise gave the South
   Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by
   allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each
   state's total population. This provision increased the political power
   of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was
   extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and
   transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.

   To assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national
   government, the nation adopted the United States Bill of Rights in
   1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it
   guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious
   practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved
   rights (which were not specified).^[36]

The New Chief Executive[edit]

   George Washington – a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War,
   commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and president of the
   Constitutional Convention – became the first President of the United
   States under the new Constitution in 1789. The national capital moved
   from New York to Philadelphia and finally settled in Washington DC in
   1800.

   The major accomplishments of the Washington Administration were
   creating a strong national government that was recognized without
   question by all Americans.^[37] His government, following the vigorous
   leadership of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, assumed the debts
   of the states (the debt holders received federal bonds), created the
   Bank of the United States to stabilize the financial system, and set up
   a uniform system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other taxes to pay
   off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure. To support his
   programs Hamilton created a new political party – the first in the
   world based on voters – the Federalist Party.

   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison formed an opposition Republican
   Party (usually called the Democratic-Republican Party by political
   scientists). Hamilton and Washington presented the country in 1794 with
   the Jay Treaty that reestablished good relations with Britain. The
   Jeffersonians vehemently protested, and the voters aligned behind one
   party or the other, thus setting up the First Party System. Federalists
   promoted business, financial and commercial interests and wanted more
   trade with Britain. Republicans accused the Federalists of plans to
   establish a monarchy, turn the rich into a ruling class, and making the
   United States a pawn of the British.^[38] The treaty passed, but
   politics became intensely heated.^[39]

   The Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, when western settlers protested against
   a federal tax on liquor, was the first serious test of the federal
   government. Washington called out the state militia and personally led
   an army, as the insurgents melted away and the power of the national
   government was firmly established.^[40]

   Washington refused to serve more than two terms – setting a precedent –
   and in his famous farewell address, he extolled the benefits of federal
   government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against
   foreign alliances and the formation of political parties.^[41]

   John Adams, a Federalist, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 election. War
   loomed with France and the Federalists used the opportunity to try to
   silence the Republicans with the Alien and Sedition Acts, build up a
   large army with Hamilton at the head, and prepare for a French
   invasion. However, the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a
   successful peace mission to France that ended the Quasi-War of
   1798.^[38]^[42]

Slavery[edit]

   Main article: Slavery in the United States

   During the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, there were
   dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an
   increase in the number of freed blacks. Inspired by revolutionary
   ideals of the equality of men and their lesser economic reliance on it,
   northern states abolished slavery, although some had gradual
   emancipation schemes. States of the Upper South made manumission
   easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of free blacks in
   the Upper South from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10
   percent by 1810. By that date, a total of 13.5 percent of all blacks in
   the United States were free.^[43] After that date, with the demand for
   slaves on the rise with the development of the Deep South for cotton
   cultivation, the rate of manumissions declined sharply, and an internal
   slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and
   traders.

19th century[edit]

Jeffersonian Republican Era[edit]

   Jefferson saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist; he was
   keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.
   Territorial expansion; Louisiana Purchase in white.

   Thomas Jefferson defeated Adams for the presidency in the 1800
   election. Jefferson's major achievement as president was the Louisiana
   Purchase in 1803, which provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for
   expansion west of the Mississippi River.^[44]

   Jefferson, a scientist himself, supported expeditions to explore and
   map the new domain, most notably the Lewis and Clark Expedition.^[45]
   Jefferson believed deeply in republicanism and argued it should be
   based on the independent yeoman farmer and planter; he distrusted
   cities, factories and banks. He also distrusted the federal government
   and judges, and tried to weaken the judiciary. However he met his match
   in John Marshall, a Federalist from Virginia. Although the Constitution
   specified a Supreme Court, its functions were vague until Marshall, the
   Chief Justice (1801–35), defined them, especially the power to overturn
   acts of Congress or states that violated the Constitution, first
   enunciated in 1803 in Marbury v. Madison.^[46]

War of 1812[edit]

   Main article: War of 1812

   Americans were increasingly angry at the British violation of American
   ships' neutral rights in order to hurt France, the impressment
   (seizure) of 10,000 American sailors needed by the Royal Navy to fight
   Napoleon, and British support for hostile Indians attacking American
   settlers in the Midwest. They may also have desired to annex all or
   part of British North America.^[47]^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51] Despite strong
   opposition from the Northeast, especially from Federalists who did not
   want to disrupt trade with Britain, Congress declared war in June 18,
   1812.^[52]

   The war was frustrating for both sides. Both sides tried to invade the
   other and were repulsed. The American high command remained incompetent
   until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because
   the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada
   repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce,
   bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who
   smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry
   Harrison finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the
   Indians under Tecumseh in Canada,^[53] while Andrew Jackson ended the
   Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the
   Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of
   Maine.

   The British raided and burned Washington, but were repelled at
   Baltimore in 1814 – where the "Star Spangled Banner" was written to
   celebrate the American success. In upstate New York a major British
   invasion of New York State was turned back. Finally in early 1815
   Andrew Jackson decisively defeated a major British invasion at the
   Battle of New Orleans, making him the most famous war hero.^[54]

   With Napoleon (apparently) gone, the causes of the war had evaporated
   and both sides agreed to a peace that left the prewar boundaries
   intact. Americans claimed victory in February 18, 1815 as news came
   almost simultaneously of Jackson's victory of New Orleans and the peace
   treaty that left the prewar boundaries in place. Americans swelled with
   pride at success in the "second war of independence"; the naysayers of
   the antiwar Federalist Party were put to shame and it never recovered.
   The Indians were the big losers; they never gained the independent
   nationhood Britain had promised and no longer posed a serious threat as
   settlers poured into the Midwest.^[54]

Era of Good Feelings[edit]

   Main article: Era of Good Feelings

   As strong opponents of the war, the Federalists held the Hartford
   Convention in 1814 that hinted at disunion. National euphoria after the
   victory at New Orleans ruined the prestige of the Federalists and they
   no longer played a significant role.^[55] President Madison and most
   Republicans realized they were foolish to let the Bank of the United
   States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of
   the war. So, with the assistance of foreign bankers, they chartered the
   Second Bank of the United States in 1816.^[56]^[57]

   The Republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant
   industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S.
   With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many
   Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of
   President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay
   partisanship, the nation entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less
   partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party
   System.^[56]^[57]

   The Monroe Doctrine, expressed in 1823, proclaimed the United States'
   opinion that European powers should no longer colonize or interfere in
   the Americas. This was a defining moment in the foreign policy of the
   United States. The Monroe Doctrine was adopted in response to American
   and British fears over Russian and French expansion into the Western
   Hemisphere.^[58]

   In 1832, President Andrew Jackson, 7th President of the United States,
   ran for a second term under the slogan "Jackson and no bank" and didn't
   renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States of
   America.^[59] Jackson was convinced that central banking was used by
   the elite to take advantage of the average American.^[59]

Indian removal[edit]

   Settlers crossing the Plains of Nebraska.

   In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the
   president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal
   lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi
   River.^[60] Its goal was primarily to remove Native Americans,
   including the Five Civilized Tribes, from the American Southeast; they
   occupied land that settlers wanted. Jacksonian Democrats demanded the
   forcible removal of native populations who refused to acknowledge state
   laws to reservations in the West; Whigs and religious leaders opposed
   the move as inhumane. Thousands of deaths resulted from the
   relocations, as seen in the Cherokee Trail of Tears.^[61] Many of the
   Seminole Indians in Florida refused to move west; they fought the Army
   for years in the Seminole Wars.

Second Party System[edit]

   Main article: Second Party System

   After the First Party System of Federalists and Republicans withered
   away in the 1820s, the stage was set for the emergence of a new party
   system based on very well organized local parties that appealed for the
   votes of (almost) all adult white men. The former Jeffersonian party
   split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to
   President James Monroe, and the party faction that supported many of
   the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van
   Buren, became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the
   transformation in 1828:

          Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed.
          Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties,
          political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had
          elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first
          well-organized national party...and tight party organization
          became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American
          politics.^[62]

   Opposing factions led by Henry Clay helped form the Whig Party. The
   Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs
   until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.

   Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a
   widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:

          The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a
          fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an
          agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the
          enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 "corrupt bargain" had
          strengthened their suspicion of Washington
          politics....Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and
          political power. They believed that government intervention in
          the economy benefited special-interest groups and created
          corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to
          restore the independence of the individual--the artisan and the
          ordinary farmer--by ending federal support of banks and
          corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which
          they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of
          government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power
          was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto
          more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his
          supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to
          turn their programs into legislation called for a more active
          government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like
          educational reform mid the establishment of a public education
          system. They believed, for instance, that public schools
          restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental
          responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing
          church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian
          concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating
          the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.^[63]^[64]

Second Great Awakening[edit]

   Main article: Second Great Awakening

   The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant revival movement that
   affected the entire nation during the early 19th century and led to
   rapid church growth. The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by
   1800, and, after 1820 membership rose rapidly among Baptist and
   Methodist congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past
   its peak by the 1840s.^[65]

   It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical
   denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many
   converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The
   Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform
   movements – including abolitionism and temperance designed to remove
   the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus
   Christ.^[66]

Abolitionism[edit]

   After 1840 the growing abolitionist movement redefined itself as a
   crusade against the sin of slave ownership. It mobilized support
   (especially among religious women in the Northeast affected by the
   Second Great Awakening). William Lloyd Garrison published the most
   influential of the many anti-slavery newspapers, The Liberator, while
   Frederick Douglass, an ex-slave, began writing for that newspaper
   around 1840 and started his own abolitionist newspaper North Star in
   1847.^[67] The great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as
   Abraham Lincoln, rejected Garrison's theology and held that slavery was
   an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.^[68]^[69]

Westward expansion and Manifest Destiny[edit]

   Main article: American frontier

   The American colonies and the new nation grew very rapidly in
   population and area, as pioneers pushed the frontier of settlement
   west.^[70] The process finally ended around 1890-1912 as the last major
   farmlands and ranch lands were settled. Native American tribes in some
   places resisted militarily, but they were overwhelmed by settlers and
   the army and after 1830 were relocated to reservations in the west. The
   highly influential "Frontier Thesis" argues that the frontier shaped
   the national character, with its boldness, violence, innovation,
   individualism, and democracy.^[71]

   Recent historians have emphasized the multicultural nature of the
   frontier. Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the "Wild
   West" of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and
   Faragher, "frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense
   of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and
   the formation of states". They explain, "It is a tale of conquest, but
   also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and
   cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America."^[71]

   Through wars and treaties, establishment of law and order, building
   farms, ranches, and towns, marking trails and digging mines, and
   pulling in great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded
   from coast to coast fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. As the
   American frontier passed into history, the myths of the west in fiction
   and film took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners
   alike. America is exceptional in choosing its iconic self-image. "No
   other nation," says David Murdoch, "has taken a time and place from its
   past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America’s
   creation of the West."^[72]

   From the early 1830s to 1869, the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots
   were used by over 300,000 settlers. '49ers (in the California Gold
   Rush), ranchers, farmers, and entrepreneurs and their families headed
   to California, Oregon, and other points in the far west. Wagon-trains
   took five or six months on foot; after 1869, the trip took 6 days by
   rail.^[73]
   American occupation of Mexico City during the Mexican–American War.

   Manifest Destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to
   expand across the continent. This concept was born out of "A sense of
   mission to redeem the Old World by high example... generated by the
   potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven."^[74] Manifest
   Destiny was rejected by modernizers, especially the Whigs like Henry
   Clay and Abraham Lincoln who wanted to build cities and factories – not
   more farms.^[75] However Democrats strongly favored expansion, and they
   won the key election of 1844. After a bitter debate in Congress the
   Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845, which Mexico had warned meant
   war. War broke out in 1846, with the homefront polarized as Whigs
   opposed and Democrats supported the war. The U.S. army, using regulars
   and large numbers of volunteers, won the Mexican-American War
   (1846–48). The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made peace; Mexico
   recognized the annexation of Texas and ceded its claims in the
   Southwest (especially California and New Mexico). The Hispanic
   residents were given full citizenship and the Mexican Indians became
   American Indians. Simultaneously gold was discovered, pulling over
   100,000 men to northern California in a matter of months in the
   California Gold Rush. Not only did the then president James K. Polk
   expand America's border to the Republic of Texas and a fraction of
   Mexico but he also annexed the north western frontier known as the
   Oregon Country, which was renamed the Oregon Territory.^[76]

Divisions between North and South[edit]

   Main articles: Origins of the American Civil War and American Civil War
   The Union: blue (free), yellow (slave);
   The Confederacy: brown
   *territories in lighter shades of blue and brown

   The central issue after 1848 was the expansion of slavery, pitting the
   anti-slavery elements that were a majority in the North, against the
   pro-slavery elements that overwhelmingly dominated the white South. A
   small number of very active Northerners were abolitionists who declared
   that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology)
   and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers were against
   the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction
   so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms
   owned and cultivated by a family), free labor (no slaves), and free
   speech (as opposed to censorship rampant in the South). Southern whites
   insisted that slavery was of economic social and cultural benefit to
   all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all
   antislavery spokesmen as "abolitionists."^[77]

   Religious activists split on slavery, with the Methodists and Baptists
   dividing into northern and southern denominations. In the North, the
   Methodists, Congregationalists and Quakers included many abolitionists,
   especially among women activists. The Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran
   denominations largely ignored the slavery issue.^[78]

   The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by
   the Compromise of 1850 brokered by Whig Henry Clay and Democrat Stephen
   Douglas; the Compromise included admission of California as a free
   state. The sore point was the Fugitive Slave Act, which increased
   federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in
   turning over fugitive slaves to masters. Abolitionists fastened on the
   Act to attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery novel Uncle
   Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe.^[79]

   The Compromise of 1820 was repealed in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska
   Act, promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of "popular sovereignty"
   and democracy. It permitted settlers to decide on slavery in each
   territory, and allowed Douglas to say he was neutral on the slavery
   issue. Antislavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new
   Republican Party. Pro and anti-forces rushed to Kansas to vote slavery
   up or down, resulting in a mini civil war called Bleeding Kansas. By
   the late 1850s the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern
   states and thus the electoral college, and insisted that slavery would
   never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).^[80]

   The southern slave societies had become wealthy based on their cotton
   and other commodity production, and some particularly profited from the
   internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and
   regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking,
   shipping, and manufacturing, including textile mills. By 1860, there
   were four million slaves in the South, nearly eight times as many as
   the total slaves nationwide in 1790. The plantations were highly
   profitable because of the heavy European demand for raw cotton; most of
   the profits were invested in new lands and new slaves drawn from the
   declining tobacco regions. For 50 of the nation's first 72 years a
   slaveholder served as president of the United States and, during that
   period, only slaveholding presidents were re-elected to second
   terms.^[81] In addition, southern states benefited by their increased
   apportionment in Congress due to the partial counting of slaves in
   their populations.

   Slave rebellions were planned or actually took place – including by
   Gabriel Prosser (1800), Denmark Vesey (1822), Nat Turner (1831), and
   John Brown (1859) – but they only involved dozens of people and all
   failed. They caused fear in the white South, which imposed tighter
   slave oversight and reduced the rights of free blacks. The Fugitive
   Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners
   when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged northerners.
   Formerly, an escaped slave, having reached a non-slave state, was
   presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom. The Supreme Court's
   1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ruled that the Missouri
   Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said it threatened
   to make slavery national.

   After Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election, seven Southern states
   seceded from the union and set up a new nation, the Confederate States
   of America, on February 8, 1861. It attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. Army
   fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for
   troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states
   seceded and joined the Confederacy. Four of the five northernmost
   "slave states" did not secede and became known as the Border States.
   During the war the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded and became
   the loyal Union state of West Virginia, .^[82]

Civil War[edit]

   Main article: American Civil War
   The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the
   war; the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union

   The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked
   a U.S. military installation at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. In
   response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to
   send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the
   capital, and "preserve the Union", which in his view still existed
   intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had
   their first major clash at the First Battle of Bull Run, ending in a
   Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and
   Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than
   originally anticipated.^[83]
   Lincoln with Allan Pinkerton and Major General John Alexander
   McClernand at the Battle of Antietam.

   The war soon divided into two theaters: Eastern and Western. In the
   western theater, the Union was quite successful, with major battles,
   such as Perryville and Shiloh, producing strategic Union victories and
   destroying major Confederate operations.^[84]
   Irish anger at the draft led to the New York Draft Riots of 1863, one
   of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history

   Warfare in the Eastern theater started poorly for the Union as the
   Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside
   Washington. Major General George B. McClellan was put in charge of the
   Union armies. After reorganizing the new Army of the Potomac, McClellan
   failed to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia in his
   Peninsula Campaign and retreated after attacks from newly appointed
   Confederate General Robert E. Lee.^[85]

   Feeling confident in his army after defeating the Union at Second Bull
   Run, Lee embarked on an invasion of the north that was stopped by
   McClellan at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Despite this, McClellan was
   relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee's crippled army. The
   next commander, General Ambrose Burnside, suffered a humiliating defeat
   by Lee's smaller army at the Battle of Fredericksburg late in 1862,
   causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the Battle
   of Chancellorsville in May 1863, while losing his top aide, Stonewall
   Jackson. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the
   west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause
   war-weariness in the North. In perhaps the turning point of the war,
   Lee's army was badly beaten at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3,
   1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.^[86]
   Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864

   Simultaneously on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of
   General Ulysses S. Grant gained control of the Mississippi River at the
   Battle of Vicksburg, thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made
   General Grant commander of all Union armies.

   The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, with Grant
   launching a war of attrition against General Lee's Army of Northern
   Virginia. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns.
   The first of these, the Overland Campaign forced Lee to retreat into
   the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive,
   the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign in which he besieged Petersburg. After
   a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the defense of
   Fort Gregg allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant
   pursued and launched the final, Appomattox Campaign which resulted in
   Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at
   Appomattox Court House. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the
   war ended with no postwar insurgency.

   Based on 1860 census figures, about 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43
   died in the war, including 6% from the North and 18% from the
   South,^[87] establishing the American Civil War as the deadliest war in
   American history. Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United
   States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal

Reconstruction[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States (1865–1918)

   Freedmen voting in New Orleans, 1867

   Reconstruction lasted from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of
   January 1, 1863 to the Compromise of 1877.^[88]

   The major issues faced by Lincoln were the status of the ex-slaves
   (called "Freedmen"), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the
   status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal
   government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of
   whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions.

   The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed
   Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the
   Freedmen's Bureau, operated by the Army.^[89]

   Three "Reconstruction Amendments" were passed to expand civil rights
   for black Americans: the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery; the
   Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship
   for blacks; the Fifteenth Amendment prevented race from being used to
   disfranchise men.

   Ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for over
   two years, but that changed when the Radical Republicans gained control
   of Congress in the 1866 elections. President Andrew Johnson, who sought
   easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless; he
   escaped by one vote removal through impeachment. Congress enfranchised
   black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the
   right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on
   a coalition of Freedmen made up of Carpetbaggers (new arrivals from the
   North), and Scalawags (native white Southerners). They were backed by
   the US Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights
   of whites. State by state they lost power to a conservative-Democratic
   coalition, which gained control of the entire South by 1877. In
   response to Radical Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) emerged in
   1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights
   and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of
   the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded.
   Paramilitary groups, such as the White League and Red Shirts emerged
   about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to
   suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across
   the South during the 1870s. Rable described them as the military arm of
   the Democratic Party.^[90]

   Reconstruction ended after the disputed 1876 election between
   Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes and Democratic candidate
   Samuel J. Tilden. With a compromise Hayes won the White House, the
   federal government withdrew its troops from the South, and Southern
   Democrats re-entered the national political scene.^[91] From 1890 to
   1908, southern states effectively disfranchised most black voters and
   many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through
   poll taxes, literacy tests, and other arbitrary devices. They passed
   segregation laws and imposed second-class status on blacks in a system
   known as Jim Crow that lasted until the successes of the Civil Rights
   movement in 1964-65.^[92]^[93]

   Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which
   demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their
   suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white
   and black Baptist preachers after the War. Southern white preachers
   said:

          God had chastised them and given them a special mission – to
          maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and
          traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been
          sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the
          end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.

   In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:

          God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to
          exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to
          affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood
          of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form
          their own churches, associations, and conventions. These
          institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided
          places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a
          result, black preachers continued to insist that God would
          protect and help him; God would be there rock in a stormy
          land.^[94]

The West and the Gilded Age[edit]

   Completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (1869) at First
   Transcontinental Railroad, by Andrew J. Russell.
   Main article: Gilded Age

   The latter half of the nineteenth century was marked by the rapid
   development and settlement of the far West, first by wagon trains and
   riverboats and then aided by the completion of the transcontinental
   railroad. Large numbers of European immigrants (especially from Germany
   and Scandinavia) took up low-cost or free farms in the Prairie States.
   Mining for silver and copper opened up the Mountain West. The United
   States Army fought frequent small-scale wars with Native Americans as
   settlers encroached on their traditional lands. Gradually the US
   purchased the Native American tribal lands and extinguished their
   claims, forcing most tribes onto subsidized reservations. According to
   the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), from 1789 to 1894:

     The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been
     more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000
     white men, women and children, including those killed in individual
     combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians.^[95]

   The "Gilded Age" was a term that Mark Twain used to describe the period
   of the late 19th century when there had been a dramatic expansion of
   American wealth and prosperity. Reform of the Age included the Civil
   Service Act, which mandated a competitive examination for applicants
   for government jobs. Other important legislation included the
   Interstate Commerce Act, which ended railroads' discrimination against
   small shippers, and the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlawed
   monopolies in business. Twain believed that this age was corrupted by
   such elements as land speculators, scandalous politics, and unethical
   business practices.^[96] Since the days of Charles A. Beard and Matthew
   Josephson, some historians have argued that the United States was
   effectively plutocratic for at least part of the Gilded Age and
   Progressive Era.^[97]^[98]^[99]^[100]^[101] As financiers and
   industrialists such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller began to
   amass vast fortunes, many US observers were concerned that the nation
   was losing its pioneering egalitarian spirit.^[102]

   By 1890 American industrial production and per capita income exceeded
   those of all other world nations. In response to heavy debts and
   decreasing farm prices, wheat and cotton farmers joined the Populist
   Party.^[103] An unprecedented wave of immigration from Europe served to
   both provide the labor for American industry and create diverse
   communities in previously undeveloped areas. From 1880 to 1914, peak
   years of immigration, more than 22 million people migrated to the
   United States.^[104] Most were unskilled workers who quickly found jobs
   in mines, mills, factories. Many immigrants were craftsmen (especially
   from Britain and Germany) bringing human skills, and others were
   farmers (especially from Germany and Scandinavia) who purchased
   inexpensive land on the Prairies from railroads who sent agents to
   Europe. Poverty, growing inequality and dangerous working conditions,
   along with socialist and anarchist ideas diffusing from European
   immigrants, led to the rise of the labor movement, which often included
   violent strikes.^[105]^[106]

   Skilled workers banded together to control their crafts and raise wages
   by forming labor unions in industrial areas of the Northeast. Before
   the 1930s few factory workers joined the unions in the labor movement.
   Samuel Gompers led the American Federation of Labor 1886-1924,
   coordinating multiple unions. Industrial growth was very rapid, led by
   John D. Rockefeller in oil and Andrew Carnegie in steel; both became
   leaders of philanthropy, giving away their fortunes to create the
   modern system of hospitals, universities, libraries, and foundations.

   Lower East Side, circa 1900. Almost 97% of residents of the 10 largest
   American cities of 1900 were non-Hispanic whites.^[107]

   A severe nationwide depression broke out in 1893; it was called the
   Panic of 1893 and impacted farmers, workers, and businessmen who saw
   prices, wages, and profits fall.^[108] Many railroads went bankrupt.
   The resultant political reaction fell on the Democratic Party, whose
   leader President Grover Cleveland shouldered much of the blame. Labor
   unrest involved numerous strikes, most notably the violent Pullman
   Strike of 1894, which was shut down by federal troops under Cleveland's
   orders. The Populist Party gained strength among cotton and wheat
   farmers, as well as coal miners, but was overtaken by the even more
   popular Free Silver movement, which demanded using silver to enlarge
   the money supply, leading to inflation that the silverites promised
   would end the depression.^[109]

   The financial, railroad, and business communities fought back hard,
   arguing that only the gold standard would save the economy. In the most
   intense election in the nation's history, conservative Republican
   William McKinley defeated silverite William Jennings Bryan, who ran on
   the Democratic, Populist, and Silver Republican tickets. Bryan swept
   the South and West, but McKinley ran up landslides among the middle
   class, industrial workers, cities, and among upscale farmers in the
   Midwest.^[110]

   Prosperity returned under McKinley, the gold standard was enacted, and
   the tariff was raised. By 1900 the US had the strongest economy on the
   globe. Apart from two short recessions (in 1907 and 1920) the overall
   economy remained prosperous and growing until 1929. Republicans, citing
   McKinley's policies, took the credit.^[111]

20th century[edit]

Progressive Era[edit]

   Main article: Progressive Era

   Dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the
   corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to
   deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to
   the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the 1890s. In every major
   city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education,
   medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization
   and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in
   politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change.
   Leading politicians from both parties, most notably Theodore Roosevelt,
   Charles Evans Hughes, and Robert LaFollette on the Republican side, and
   William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson on the Democratic side, took
   up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in
   demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most
   prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago. "Muckraking" journalists
   such as Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis exposed
   corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city
   poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such
   industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new
   constitutional amendments – the Sixteenth through Nineteenth – resulted
   from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct
   election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage.^[112] The
   Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period
   was 1900–18.^[113]

Imperialism[edit]

   Further information: American imperialism

   The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after
   1890. The main episode was the Spanish–American War, which began when
   Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in
   Cuba.^[114] The "splendid little war", as one official called it,
   involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea. At
   the Treaty of Paris peace conference the United States acquired the
   Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam.^[115]

   Cuba became an independent country, under close American tutelage.
   Although the war itself was widely popular, the peace terms proved
   controversial. William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in
   opposition to control of the Philippines, which he denounced as
   imperialism unbecoming to American democracy.^[115] President William
   McKinley defended the acquisition and was riding high as the nation had
   returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war. McKinley easily
   defeated Bryan in a rematch in the 1900 presidential election.^[116]

   After defeating an insurrection by Filipino nationalists, the United
   States engaged in a large-scale program to modernize the economy of the
   Philippines and dramatically upgrade the public health
   facilities.^[117] By 1908, however, Americans lost interest in an
   empire and turned their international attention to the Caribbean,
   especially the building of the Panama Canal. In 1912 when Arizona
   became the final mainland state, the American Frontier came to an end.
   The canal opened in 1914 and increased trade with Japan and the rest of
   the Far East. A key innovation was the Open Door Policy, whereby the
   imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business, with not
   one of them allowed to take control of China.^[118]

World War I[edit]

   front during World War I

   As World War I raged in Europe from 1914, President Woodrow Wilson took
   full control of foreign policy, declaring neutrality but warning
   Germany that resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against
   American ships supplying goods to Allied nations would mean war.
   Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off supplies
   to Britain; the U.S. declared war in April 1917.^[119] American money,
   food, and munitions arrived quickly, but troops had to be drafted and
   trained; by summer 1918 American soldiers under General John J.
   Pershing arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day, while Germany was unable
   to replace its losses.^[120]

   The result was Allied victory in November 1918. President Wilson
   demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms, the Fourteen
   Points. Wilson dominated the 1919 Paris Peace Conference but Germany
   was treated harshly by the Allies in the Treaty of Versailles (1919) as
   Wilson put all his hopes in the new League of Nations. Wilson refused
   to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional
   power to declare war, and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the
   League.^[121]

Women's suffrage[edit]

   Alice Paul stands before the Woman Suffrage Amendment's ratification
   banner.
   Alice Paul wrote the Equal Rights Amendment, whose passage became an
   unachieved goal of the feminist movement in the 1970s

   The women's suffrage movement began with the June 1848 National
   Convention of the Liberty Party. Presidential candidate Gerrit Smith
   argued for and established women's suffrage as a party plank. One month
   later, his cousin Elizabeth Cady Stanton joined with Lucretia Mott and
   other women to organize the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring the
   Declaration of Sentiments demanding equal rights for women, and the
   right to vote.^[122] Many of these activists became politically aware
   during the abolitionist movement. The women's rights campaign during
   "first-wave feminism" was led by Stanton, Lucy Stone and Susan B.
   Anthony, among many others. Stone and Paulina Wright Davis organized
   the prominent and influential National Women's Rights Convention in
   1850. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced
   campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Women's
   Christian Temperance Union. By the end of the 19th century a few
   western states had granted women full voting rights,^[123] though women
   had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as
   property and child custody.^[124]

   Around 1912 the feminist movement, which had grown sluggish, began to
   reawaken, putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing
   that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women
   because men could not do that job.^[125] Protests became increasingly
   common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capital and
   major cities. Paul split from the large National American Woman
   Suffrage Association (NAWSA), which favored a more moderate approach
   and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by Carrie
   Chapman Catt, and formed the more militant National Woman's Party.
   Suffragists were arrested during their "Silent Sentinels" pickets at
   the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken
   as political prisoners.^[126]

   The old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war, and
   therefore only men deserve the right to vote, was refuted by the
   enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on
   the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave
   women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had
   already given the women the right to vote in state and national
   elections, and the representatives from those states, including the
   first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that woman
   suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where
   white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.
   Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, and women could vote
   in 1920.^[127]

   NAWSA became the League of Women Voters, and the National Woman's Party
   began lobbying for full equality and the Equal Rights Amendment, which
   would pass Congress during the second wave of the women's movement in
   1972. Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues
   of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, and
   world peace.^[128]^[129] The main surge of women voting came in 1928,
   when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to
   elect Al Smith, a Catholic from New York City. Meanwhile Protestants
   mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican Herbert
   Hoover.^[130]

Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression[edit]

   Further information: Great Depression and New Deal
   Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol in Chicago, 1921

   In the 1920s the U.S. grew steadily in stature as an economic and
   military world power. The United States Senate did not ratify the
   Treaty of Versailles imposed by its Allies on the defeated Central
   Powers; instead, the United States chose to pursue unilateralism.^[131]
   The aftershock of Russia's October Revolution resulted in real fears of
   Communism in the United States, leading to a Red Scare and the
   deportation of aliens considered subversive.

   While public health facilities grew rapidly in the Progressive Era, and
   hospitals and medical schools were modernized,^[132] the nation in 1918
   lost 675,000 lives to the Spanish flu pandemic.^[133]

   In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol were
   prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment, Prohibition. The result was
   that in cities illegal alcohol became a big business, largely
   controlled by racketeers. The second Ku Klux Klan grew rapidly in
   1922-25, then collapsed. Immigration laws were passed to strictly limit
   the number of new entries. The 1920s were called the Roaring Twenties
   due to the great economic prosperity during this period. Jazz became
   popular among the younger generation, and thus the decade was also
   called the Jazz Age.

   California, centering on Florence Owens Thompson, a mother of seven,

   The Great Depression (1929–39) and the New Deal (1933–36) were decisive
   moments in American political, economic, and social history that
   reshaped the nation.^[134]

   During the 1920s, the nation enjoyed widespread prosperity, albeit with
   a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble was fueled by an inflated
   stock market, which later led to the Stock Market Crash on October 29,
   1929.^[135] This, along with many other economic factors, triggered a
   worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time,
   the United States experienced deflation as prices fell, unemployment
   soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and
   manufacturing output plunged by one-third.

   In 1932, Democratic presidential nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt promised
   "a New Deal for the American people", coining the enduring label for
   his domestic policies. The desperate economic situation, along with the
   substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 elections, gave Roosevelt
   unusual influence over Congress in the "First Hundred Days" of his
   administration. He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series
   of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system,
   stock market, industry, and agriculture, along with many other
   government efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American
   economy. The New Deal regulated much of the economy, especially the
   financial sector. It provided relief to the unemployed through numerous
   programs, such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and (for
   young men) the Civilian Conservation Corps. Large scale spending
   projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the
   infrastructure were under the purview of the Public Works
   Administration. Roosevelt turned left in 1935–36, building up labor
   unions through the Wagner Act. Unions became a powerful element of the
   merging New Deal Coalition, which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936,
   1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief
   recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially
   Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North
   (where they could vote). Some of the programs were dropped in the 1940s
   when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the
   Conservative Coalition. Of special importance is the Social Security
   program, begun in 1935.^[136]

World War II[edit]

   The Japanese crippled American naval power with the attack on Pearl
   Harbor, knocking out all the battleships
   Further information: World War II, Military history of the United
   States during World War II and United States home front during World
   War II

   In the Depression years, the United States remained focused on domestic
   concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries
   fell under the control of dictators. Imperial Japan asserted dominance
   in East Asia and in the Pacific. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy
   militarized to and threatened conquests, while Britain and France
   attempted appeasement to avert another war in Europe. US legislation in
   the Neutrality Acts sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy
   clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German
   invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II.
   Roosevelt positioned the US as the "Arsenal of Democracy", pledging
   full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies – but no
   military personnel.^[137] Japan tried to neutralize America's power in
   the Pacific by attacking Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which
   catalyzed American support to enter the war and seek revenge.^[138]

   The main contributions of the US to the Allied war effort comprised
   money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation,
   and (especially 1944–45), military personnel. Much of the focus in
   Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The
   overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast
   quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas,
   the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40%
   of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of
   millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high
   efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology
   and management, and the move into the active labor force of students,
   retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in
   hours worked.

   It was exhausting; leisure activities declined sharply. People
   tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the
   confidence that it was only "for the duration", and life would return
   to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became
   unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In
   industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and
   lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and
   Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed
   growth after the war instead of a return to depression.^[139]^[140]

   The Allies – the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union, as well as China,
   Canada and other countries – fought the Axis powers of Germany, Italy,
   and Japan. The Allies saw Germany as the main threat and gave highest
   priority to Europe. The US dominated the war against Japan and stopped
   Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942. After losing Pearl Harbor
   and in the Philippines to the Japanese, and drawing the Battle of the
   Coral Sea (May 1942), the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at
   Midway (June 1942). American ground forces assisted in the North
   African Campaign that eventually concluded with the collapse of
   Mussolini's fascist government in 1943, as Italy switched to the Allied
   side. A more significant European front was opened on D-Day, June 6,
   1944, in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France
   from Britain.

   On the home front, mobilization of the US economy was managed by
   Roosevelt's War Production Board. The wartime production boom led to
   full employment, wiping out this vestige of the Great Depression.
   Indeed, labor shortages encouraged industry to look for new sources of
   workers, finding new roles for women and blacks.^[142]

   However, the fervor also inspired anti-Japanese sentiment, which was
   handled by removing everyone of Japanese descent from the West Coast
   war zone.^[143] Research and development took flight as well, best seen
   in the Manhattan Project, a secret effort to harness nuclear fission to
   produce highly destructive atomic bombs.^[144]

   The Allied pushed the Germans out of France but faced an unexpected
   counterattack at the Battle of the Bulge in December. The final German
   effort failed, and, as Allied armies in East and West were converging
   on Berlin, the Nazis hurriedly tried to kill the last remaining Jews.
   The western front stopped short, leaving Berlin to the Soviets as the
   Nazi regime formally capitulated in May 1945, ending the war in
   Europe.^[145] Over in the Pacific, the US implemented an island hopping
   strategy toward Tokyo, establishing airfields for bombing runs against
   mainland Japan from the Mariana Islands and achieving hard-fought
   victories at Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945.^[146] Bloodied at Okinawa,
   the U.S. prepared to invade Japan's home islands when B-29s dropped
   atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing
   the empire's surrender in a matter of days and thus ending World War
   II.^[147] The US occupied Japan (and part of Germany), sending Douglas
   MacArthur to restructure the Japanese economy and political system
   along American lines.^[148]

   Though the nation lost more than 400,000 military personnel,^[149] the
   mainland prospered untouched by the devastation of war that inflicted a
   heavy toll on Europe and Asia.

   Participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant
   American isolationism. The awesome threat of nuclear weapons inspired
   both optimism and fear. Nuclear weapons were never used after 1945, as
   both sides drew back from the brink and a "long peace" characterized
   the Cold War years, starting with the Truman Doctrine in May 22, 1947.
   There were, however, regional wars in Korea and Vietnam.^[150]

The Cold War, counterculture, and civil rights[edit]

   United States (1964–80) and United States in the 1950s

   Following World War II, the United States emerged as one of the two
   dominant superpowers, the USSR being the other. The U.S. Senate on a
   bipartisan vote approved U.S. participation in the United Nations (UN),
   which marked a turn away from the traditional isolationism of the U.S.
   and toward increased international involvement.

   The primary American goal of 1945–48 was to rescue Europe from the
   devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism,
   represented by the Soviet Union. The Truman Doctrine of 1947 provided
   military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat
   of Communist expansion in the Balkans. In 1948, the United States
   replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive Marshall
   Plan, which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe, and
   removed trade barriers, while modernizing the managerial practices of
   businesses and governments.^[151]

   The Plan's $13 billion budget was in the context of a US GDP of $258
   billion in 1948 and was in addition to the $12 billion in American aid
   given to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the
   Marshall Plan. Soviet head of state Joseph Stalin prevented his
   satellite states from participating, and from that point on, Eastern
   Europe, with inefficient centralized economies, fell further and
   further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and
   prosperity. In 1949, the United States, rejecting the long-standing
   policy of no military alliances in peacetime, formed the North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance, which continues into the 21st
   century. In response the Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of communist
   states.^[151]

   In August 1949 the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon, thereby
   escalating the risk of warfare. Indeed, the threat of mutually assured
   destruction prevented both powers from going too far, and resulted in
   proxy wars, especially in Korea and Vietnam, in which the two sides did
   not directly confront each other.^[150] Within the United States, the
   Cold War prompted concerns about Communist influence. The unexpected
   leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in 1957 with
   Sputnik, the first Earth satellite, began the Space Race, won by the
   Americans as Apollo 11 landed astronauts on the moon in 1969. The angst
   about the weaknesses of American education led to large-scale federal
   support for science education and research.^[152]

   In the decades after World War II, the United States became a global
   influence in economic, political, military, cultural, and technological
   affairs. Beginning in the 1950s, middle-class culture became obsessed
   with consumer goods. White Americans made up nearly 90% of the
   population in 1950.^[153]^[clarification needed]

   In 1960, the charismatic politician John F. Kennedy was elected as the
   first and – thus far – only Roman Catholic President of the United
   States. The Kennedy family brought a new life and vigor to the
   atmosphere of the White House. His time in office was marked by such
   notable events as the acceleration of the United States' role in the
   Space Race, escalation of the American role in the Vietnam War, the
   Cuban missile crisis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the jailing of Martin
   Luther King, Jr. during the Birmingham campaign, and the appointment of
   his brother Robert F. Kennedy to his Cabinet as Attorney General.
   Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963,
   leaving the nation in profound shock.^[154]

Climax of liberalism[edit]

   The climax of liberalism came in the mid-1960s with the success of
   President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–69) in securing congressional passage
   of his Great Society programs.^[155] They included civil rights, the
   end of segregation, Medicare, extension of welfare, federal aid to
   education at all levels, subsidies for the arts and humanities,
   environmental activism, and a series of programs designed to wipe out
   poverty.^[156]^[157] As recent historians have explained:

     Gradually, liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving
     economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s
     contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new
     deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no
     intention to fast and class passions or redistribute wealth or
     restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly
     anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage
     economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was
     fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian
     economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would
     speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund
     larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.^[158]

   Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., June 22, 1963,

   Johnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in 1964 against
   conservative Barry Goldwater, which broke the decades-long control of
   Congress by the Conservative coalition. However, the Republicans
   bounced back in 1966 and elected Richard Nixon in 1968. Nixon largely
   continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited;
   conservative reaction would come with the election of Ronald Reagan in
   1980.^[159] Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration
   from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained
   economic expansion.

Civil Rights Movement[edit]

   represented the Teamsters who were supporiting the UFW and condeming
   their IBT leadership for working as thugs against a fellow union.
   Duncan and his wife Mary were the branch organizers of the LA IS.

   Starting in the late 1950s, institutionalized racism across the United
   States, but especially in the South, was increasingly challenged by the
   growing Civil Rights movement. The activism of African-American leaders
   Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. led to the Montgomery Bus
   Boycott, which launched the movement. For years African Americans would
   struggle with violence against them but would achieve great steps
   toward equality with Supreme Court decisions, including Brown v. Board
   of Education and Loving v. Virginia, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which
   ended the Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation between
   whites and blacks.^[160]

   Martin Luther King, Jr., who had won the Nobel Peace Prize for his
   efforts to achieve equality of the races, was assassinated in 1968.
   Following his death others led the movement, most notably King's widow,
   Coretta Scott King, who was also active, like her husband, in the
   Opposition to the Vietnam War, and in the Women's Liberation Movement.
   There were 164 riots in 128 American cities in the first nine months of
   1967.^[161] Black Power emerged during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
   The decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward
   integration, especially in government service, sports, and
   entertainment. Native Americans turned to the federal courts to fight
   for their land rights. They held protests highlighting the federal
   government's failure to honor treaties. One of the most outspoken
   Native American groups was the American Indian Movement (AIM). In the
   1960s, Cesar Chavez began organizing poorly paid Mexican-American farm
   workers in California. He led a five-year-long strike by grape pickers.
   Then Chávez formed the nation's first successful union of farm workers.
   His United Farm Workers of America (UFW) faltered after a few years but
   after Chavez died in 1993 he became an iconic "folk saint" in the
   pantheon of Mexican Americans.^[162]

The Women's Movement[edit]

   Further information: Second-wave feminism
   Gloria Steinem at a meeting of the Women's Action Alliance, 1972.

   A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping
   the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's
   best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives
   felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its
   creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through
   their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that
   women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan
   and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to
   act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.^[124]^[163]

   Protests began, and the new Women's Liberation Movement grew in size
   and power, gained much media attention, and, by 1968, had replaced the
   Civil Rights Movement as the US's main social revolution. Marches,
   parades, rallies, boycotts, and pickets brought out thousands,
   sometimes millions. There were striking gains for women in medicine,
   law, and business, while only a few were elected to office. The
   Movement was split into factions by political ideology early on,
   however (with NOW on the left, the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL)
   on the right, the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) in the
   center, and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far
   left). The proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, passed
   by Congress in 1972 was defeated by a conservative coalition mobilized
   by Phyllis Schlafly. They argued that it degraded the position of the
   housewife and made young women susceptible to the military
   draft.^[164]^[165]

   However, many federal laws (i.e., those equalizing pay, employment,
   education, employment opportunities, and credit; ending pregnancy
   discrimination; and requiring NASA, the Military Academies, and other
   organizations to admit women), state laws (i.e., those ending spousal
   abuse and marital rape), Supreme Court rulings (i.e. ruling that the
   equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to women),
   and state ERAs established women's equal status under the law, and
   social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting women's
   equality. The controversial issue of abortion, deemed by the Supreme
   Court as a fundamental right in Roe v. Wade (1973), is still a point of
   debate today.^[166]

The Counterculture Revolution and Cold War Détente[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States (1964–80)

   Amid the Cold War, the United States entered the Vietnam War, whose
   growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements, including
   those among women, minorities, and young people. President Lyndon B.
   Johnson's Great Society social programs and numerous rulings by the
   Warren Court added to the wide range of social reform during the 1960s
   and 1970s. Feminism and the environmental movement became political
   forces, and progress continued toward civil rights for all Americans.
   The Counterculture Revolution swept through the nation and much of the
   western world in the late sixties and early seventies, further dividing
   Americans in a "culture war" but also bringing forth more liberated
   social views.^[167]

   Johnson was succeeded in 1969 by Republican Richard Nixon, who
   attempted to gradually turn the war over to the South Vietnamese
   forces.; He negotiated the peace treaty in 1973 which secured the
   release of POWs and lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The war had
   cost the lives of 58,000 American troops. Nixon manipulated the fierce
   distrust between the Soviet Union and China to the advantage of the
   United States, achieving détente (relaxation; ease of tension) with
   both parties.^[168]

   The Watergate scandal, involving Nixon's cover-up of his operatives'
   break-in into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the
   Watergate office complex destroyed his political base, sent many aides
   to prison, and forced Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. He was
   succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford. The Fall of Saigon ended the
   Vietnam War and resulted in North and South Vietnam being reunited.
   Communist victories in neighboring Cambodia and Laos occurred in the
   same year.^[168]

   The OPEC oil embargo marked a long-term economic transition since, for
   the first time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced
   serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics,
   and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an energy
   crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high
   inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term stagflation was
   coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of
   the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation,
   banking, and telecommunications.^[169]

   Jimmy Carter, running as someone who was not a part of the Washington
   political establishment, was elected president in 1976.^[170] On the
   world stage, Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and
   Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and
   took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the Iran hostage crisis. With
   the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the 1980
   election to the Republican Ronald Reagan.^[171] On January 20, 1981,
   minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S.
   captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the
   444-day hostage crisis.^[172]

Close of the 20th century[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States (1980–91)
   Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate challenges Soviet premier Mikhail
   Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall in 1987, shortly before the end
   of the Cold War

   Ronald Reagan produced a major realignment with his 1980 and 1984
   landslide elections. Reagan's economic policies (dubbed "Reaganomics")
   and the implementation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 lowered
   income taxes from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years.^[173]
   Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation.^[174]
   The US experienced a recession in 1982, but the negative indicators
   reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from 11% to 2%, the
   unemployment rate decreasing from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in
   November 1984,^[175] and the economic growth rate increasing from 4.5%
   to 7.2%.^[176]

   Reagan ordered a buildup of the US military, incurring additional
   budget deficits. Reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system
   known as the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) (dubbed "Star Wars" by
   opponents) in which, theoretically, the U.S. could shoot down missiles
   with laser systems in space. The Soviets reacted harshly because they
   thought it violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and would
   upset the balance of power by giving the U.S. a major military
   advantage. For years Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev argued vehemently
   against SDI. However, by the late 1980s he decided the system would
   never work and should not be used to block disarmament deals with the
   U.S.^[177] Historians argue how great an impact the SDI threat had on
   the Soviets – whether it was enough to force Gorbachev to initiate
   radical reforms, or whether the deterioration of the Soviet economy
   alone forced the reforms. There is agreement that the Soviets realized
   they were well behind the Americans in military technology, that to try
   to catch up would be very expensive, and that the military expenses
   were already a very heavy burden slowing down their economy.^[178]

   Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and bombing of Libya were popular in the
   US, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the
   controversy over the Iran–Contra affair that revealed Reagan's poor
   management style.^[179]

   Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who
   ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the
   signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Gorbachev
   tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the
   expensive arms race with America,^[180] then by shedding the East
   European empire in 1989. The Soviet Union collapsed on Christmas Day
   1991, ending the US–Soviet Cold War.
   The NASDAQ Composite index swelled with the dot-com bubble in the
   optimistic "New Economy". The bubble burst in 2000.

   The United States emerged as the world's sole remaining superpower and
   continued to intervene in international affairs during the 1990s,
   including the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Following his election in
   1992, President Bill Clinton oversaw one of the longest periods of
   economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values, a side
   effect of the digital revolution and new business opportunities created
   by the Internet. He also worked with the Republican Congress to pass
   the first balanced federal budget in 30 years.^[181]

   In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on
   charges of "high crimes and misdemeanors" for lying about a sexual
   relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky but was later
   acquitted by the Senate. The failure of impeachment and the Democratic
   gains in the 1998 election forced House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a
   Republican, to resign from Congress.^[181]

   The presidential election in 2000 between George W. Bush and Al Gore
   was one of the closest in US history and helped lay the seeds for
   political polarization to come. The vote in the decisive state of
   Florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic dispute over the
   counting of votes. The US Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore ended the
   recount with a 5–4 vote. That meant Bush, then in the lead, carried
   Florida and the election.^[182]

21st century[edit]

9/11 and the War on Terror[edit]

   Main articles: September 11 attacks, War on Terror and Nuclear 9/11
   The September 11 attacks led to the War on Terror.

   On September 11, 2001 ("9/11"), the United States was struck by a
   terrorist attack when 19 al-Qaeda hijackers commandeered four airliners
   and intentionally crashed into both twin towers of the World Trade
   Center and into the Pentagon, killing 2,550 American civilians and 55
   military personnel, along with 372 non-Americans (excluding the 19
   hijackers).^[183] In response on September 20, President George W. Bush
   announced a "War on Terror". On October 7, 2001, the United States and
   NATO then invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime, which had
   provided safe haven to al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden.^[184]

   The federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent
   future attacks. The controversial USA PATRIOT Act increased the
   government's power to monitor communications and removed legal
   restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and
   intelligence services. A cabinet-level agency called the Department of
   Homeland Security was created to lead and coordinate federal
   counter-terrorism activities.^[185] Some of these anti-terrorism
   efforts, particularly the US government's handling of detainees at the
   prison at Guantanamo Bay, led to allegations against the US government
   of human rights violations.^[186]^[187]

   In 2003, from March 19 to May 1, the United States launched an invasion
   of Iraq, which led to the collapse of the Iraq government and the
   eventual capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, with whom the US had
   long-standing tense relations. The reasons for the invasion cited by
   the Bush administration included the spreading of democracy, the
   elimination of weapons of mass destruction^[188] (a key demand of the
   UN as well, though later investigations found parts of the intelligence
   reports to be inaccurate),^[189] and the liberation of the Iraqi
   people. Despite some initial successes early in the invasion, the
   continued Iraq War fueled international protests and gradually saw
   domestic support decline as many people began to question whether or
   not the invasion was worth the cost.^[190]^[191] In 2007, after years
   of violence by the Iraqi insurgency, President Bush deployed more
   troops in a strategy dubbed "the surge". While the death toll
   decreased, the political stability of Iraq remained in doubt.^[192]

   In 2008, the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war, along
   with the 2008 financial crisis, led to the election of Barack Obama,
   the first African-American President of the United States.^[193] After
   his election, Obama reluctantly continued the war effort in Iraq until
   August 31, 2010, when he declared that combat operations had ended.
   However, 50,000 were kept in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces, help protect
   withdrawing forces, and work on counter-terrorism until December 15,
   2011, when the war was declared formally over and the last troops left
   the country.^[194] At the same time, Obama increased American
   involvement in Afghanistan, starting a surge strategy using an
   additional 30,000 troops, while proposing to begin withdrawing troops
   sometime in December 2014. With regards to Guantanamo Bay, President
   Obama forbade torture but in general retained Bush's policy regarding
   the Guantanamo detainees, while also proposing that the prison
   eventually be closed.^[195]^[196]

   In May 2011, after nearly a decade in hiding, the founder and leader of
   Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was killed in Pakistan in a raid conducted
   by US naval special forces acting under President Obama's direct
   orders. While Al Qaeda was near collapse in Afghanistan, affiliated
   organizations continued to operate in Yemen and other remote areas as
   the CIA used drones to hunt down and remove its leadership.^[197]^[198]

   In June 2014 President Obama would order American troops back into
   Iraq.

The Great Recession[edit]

   Main article: Great Recession
   Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured) filed for bankruptcy in
   September 2008 at the height of the U.S. financial crisis.

   In September 2008, the United States, and most of Europe, entered the
   longest post–World War II recession, often called the "Great
   Recession."^[199] Multiple overlapping crises were involved, especially
   the housing market crisis, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil
   prices, an automotive industry crisis, rising unemployment, and the
   worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The financial crisis
   threatened the stability of the entire economy in September 2008 when
   Lehman Brothers failed and other giant banks were in grave
   danger.^[200] Starting in October the federal government lent $245
   billion to financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief
   Program^[201] which was passed by bipartisan majorities and signed by
   Bush.^[202]

   Following his election victory by a wide electoral margin in November
   2008, Bush's successor - Barack Obama - signed into law the American
   Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was a $787 billion
   economic stimulus aimed at helping the economy recover from the
   deepening recession. Obama, like Bush, took steps to rescue the auto
   industry and prevent future economic meltdowns. These included a
   bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, putting ownership temporarily
   in the hands of the government, and the "cash for clunkers" program
   which temporarily boosted new car sales.^[203]

   The recession officially ended in June 2009, and the economy slowly
   began to expand once again.^[204] The unemployment rate peaked at 10.1%
   in October 2009 after surging from 4.7% in November 2007, and gradually
   fell to 6.2% as of July 2014. However, overall economic growth has
   remained weaker in the 2010s compared to expansions in previous
   decades.^[205]^[206]

Recent events[edit]

   Act.

   From 2009 to 2010, the 111th Congress passed major legislation such as
   the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall
   Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act^[207] and the Don't Ask,
   Don't Tell Repeal Act, which were signed into law by President
   Obama.^[208] Following the 2010 midterm elections, which resulted in a
   Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a
   Democratic-controlled Senate,^[209] Congress presided over a period of
   elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not raise the debt
   ceiling, extend tax cuts for citizens making over $250,000 annually,
   and many other key issues.^[210] These ongoing debates led to President
   Obama signing the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer
   Relief Act of 2012 - which resulted in budget sequestration cuts going
   into effect in March 2013 - as well as an increase in taxes primarily
   for the wealthy. Congressional gridlock continued as Congressional
   Republicans' call for the repeal of the Patient Protection and
   Affordable Care Act - popularly known as "Obamacare" - along with other
   various demands, resulted in the first government shutdown since the
   Clinton administration and almost led to the first default on U.S. debt
   since the 19th century. As a result of growing public frustration with
   both parties in Congress since the beginning of the decade,
   Congressional approval ratings fell to record lows, with only 11% of
   Americans approving as of October 2013.^[211]

   Other major events that have occurred during the 2010s include the rise
   of new political movements across the world, such as the conservative
   Tea Party movement and the liberal Occupy movement. There was also
   unusually severe weather over the summer of 2012, and over half the
   country experienced record drought. Hurricane Sandy caused massive
   damage to coastal areas of New York and New Jersey in late October. The
   ongoing debate over the issue of rights for the LGBT community, most
   notably that of same-sex marriage, began to shift in favor of same-sex
   couples, and has been reflected in dozens of polls released in the
   early part of the decade,^[212] President Obama becoming the first
   president to openly support same-sex marriage, and the 2013 Supreme
   Court decisions in the cases of United States v. Windsor and Perry v.
   Hollingsworth. As of June 2013, debates continue over the ongoing
   sequestration, as well as tax reform, same-sex marriage, immigration
   reform, gun control, and US foreign policy in the Middle East. In 2014
   ISIS or ISISE also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
   came to power in September they took the lives of two American
   Journalist and a British one. Leading to an air barrage of them by the
   USA and its allies in the region.
