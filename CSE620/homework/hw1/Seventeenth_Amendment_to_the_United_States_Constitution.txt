   The Seventeenth Amendment in the National Archives

   The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States
   Constitution established direct election of United States Senators by
   popular vote. The amendment supersedes Article I, § 3, Clauses 1 and 2
   of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by state
   legislatures. It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the
   Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to
   make temporary appointments until a special election can be held. Under
   the original provisions of the Constitution, senators were elected by
   state legislatures; this was intended to prevent the federal government
   from indirectly absconding with the powers and funds of the states.
   However, over time various issues with these provisions, such as the
   risk of corruption and the potential for electoral deadlocks or a lack
   of representation should a seat become vacant, led to a campaign for
   reform.

   Reformers introduced constitutional amendments in 1828, 1829, and 1855,
   with the issues finally reaching a head during the 1890s and 1900s.
   Progressives, such as William Jennings Bryan, called for reform to the
   way senators were chosen. Elihu Root and George Frisbie Hoar were
   prominent figures in the campaign to maintain the state legislative
   selection of senators. By 1910, 31 state legislatures had passed
   motions calling for reform. By 1912, 239 political parties at both the
   state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and
   33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. With a campaign
   for a state-led constitutional amendment gaining strength, and a fear
   that this could result in a "runaway convention", the proposal to
   mandate direct elections for the Senate was finally introduced in the
   Congress. It was passed by the Congress and, on May 13, 1912, was
   submitted to the states for ratification. By April 8, 1913,
   three-fourths of the states had ratified the proposed amendment, making
   it the Seventeenth Amendment. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan
   formally declared the amendment's adoption on May 31, 1913.

   Critics of the Seventeenth Amendment claim that by altering the way
   senators are elected, the states lost any representation they had in
   the federal government and that, in addition to violating the
   unamendable state suffrage clause of Article V, this led to the gradual
   "slide into ignominy" of state legislatures, as well as an
   overextension of federal power and the rise of special interest groups
   to fill the power vacuum previously occupied by state legislatures.^[1]
   In addition, concerns have been raised about the power of governors to
   appoint temporary replacements to fill vacant senate seats, both in
   terms of how this provision should be interpreted and whether it should
   be permitted at all. Accordingly, noted public figures have expressed a
   desire to reform the Seventeenth Amendment, while a few politicians
   have called for outright repeal of the amendment.^[2]

Text[edit]

     The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators
     from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and
     each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall
     have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous
     branch of the State legislatures.

     When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the
     Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of
     election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of
     any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary
     appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the
     legislature may direct.

     This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election
     or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the
     Constitution.^[3]

Background[edit]

Original composition[edit]

   James Wilson, the only member of the Constitutional Convention who
   supported electing the United States Senate by popular vote.

   Originally, under Article I, § 3, Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution,
   each state legislature elected its state's senators for a six-year
   term.^[4] Each state, regardless of size, is entitled to two senators
   as part of the Connecticut Compromise between the small and large
   states.^[5] This contrasted with the House of Representatives, a body
   elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial
   decision to make; James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly
   electing the Senate and his proposal was defeated 10–1.^[6] There were
   many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to
   the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively
   formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining
   their loyalty to their original state. However, under the Constitution
   the states were subordinated to a central government; the election of
   senators by the states reassured Antifederalists that there would be
   some protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by
   an ever-expanding federal government,^[7] providing a check on the
   power of the federal government.^[8]

   Additionally, the longer terms and avoidance of popular election turned
   the Senate into a body to "temper" the populism of the House. While the
   Representatives existed in a two-year direct election cycle, the
   senators could afford to "take a more detached view of issues coming
   before Congress".^[9] State legislatures also retained the theoretical
   right to "instruct" their senators to vote for or against proposals,
   giving them both direct and indirect representation in the federal
   government.^[10] The Senate also provided formal bicameralism, with the
   members of the Senate and House responsible to completely distinct
   constituencies; this helped defeat the problem of the federal
   government being subject to "special interests".^[11] Members of the
   Constitutional Convention also saw it as an equivalent to the House of
   Lords, containing the "better men" of society; it was hoped that they
   would provide more coolness and stability than the House of
   Representatives due to the senators' status.^[12]

Issues[edit]

   According to Judge Jay Bybee of the United States Court of Appeals for
   the Ninth Circuit, those in favor of popular elections for senators
   felt that there were primarily two problems caused by the original
   provisions: legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks.^[13] In
   terms of corruption, the general feeling was that senatorial elections
   were "bought and sold", changing hands for favors and sums of money
   rather than because of the competence of the candidate. Between 1857
   and 1900, the Senate investigated three elections over corruption. In
   1900, for example, William A. Clark had his election voided after the
   Senate concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature.
   However, Bybee and Todd Zywicki believe this concern was largely
   unfounded; there was a "dearth of hard information" on the
   subject,^[14] and in over a century of elections, only 10 were
   contested with allegations of impropriety.^[15]

   Electoral deadlocks were another issue. Because state legislatures were
   charged with deciding who to appoint as senators, the system relied on
   them being able to agree. Some states could not, and thus delayed
   sending representatives to Congress; in a few cases, the system broke
   down to the point where states completely lacked representation.^[16]
   Deadlocks started to become an issue in the 1850s, with a dead-locked
   Indiana legislature allowing a Senate seat to sit vacant for two
   years.^[17] Between 1891 and 1905, 46 elections were deadlocked, in 20
   different states;^[15] in one extreme example, a Senate seat for
   Delaware went unfilled from 1899 until 1903.^[18] The business of
   holding elections also caused great disruption in the state
   legislatures, with a full third of the Oregon House of Representatives
   choosing not to swear the oath of office in 1897 due to a dispute over
   an open Senate seat. The result was that the legislature was unable to
   pass legislation that year.^[18]

   Zywicki again argues that this was not a serious issue. Deadlocks were
   a problem, but they were the exception rather than the norm; many
   legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all. Most of those that
   did in the 19th century were the newly admitted western states, which
   suffered from "inexperienced legislatures and weak party
   discipline...as western legislatures gained experience, deadlocks
   became less frequent." While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and
   1899, they became "a good teaching experience," and Utah never again
   failed to elect senators.^[19] Another concern was that when deadlocks
   occurred, state legislatures found themselves unable to conduct their
   normal business; James Christian Ure, writing in the South Texas Law
   Review, notes that this did not in fact occur. In a deadlock situation,
   state legislatures would deal with the matter by holding "one vote at
   the beginning of the day—then the legislators would continue with their
   normal affairs".^[20]

   There was also a feeling that state legislative elections themselves
   had become dominated by the business of picking senators, with
   legislators elected based on their intentions in senatorial elections
   rather than their opinions on local issues.^[21]

Calls for reform[edit]

   William Jennings Bryan, who campaigned for the popular election of U.S.
   Senators

   Calls for a constitutional amendment regarding Senate elections started
   in the early 19th century, with Henry R. Storrs in 1826 proposing an
   amendment to provide for popular election.^[22] Similar amendments were
   introduced in 1829 and 1855, with the "most prominent" proponent being
   Andrew Johnson, who raised the issue in 1868 and considered the idea's
   merits "so palpable" that no additional explanation was necessary.^[23]
   The 1860s also saw the first major Congressional disputes over the
   issue, with the House and Senate voting to veto the appointment of John
   P. Stockton to the Senate due to his approval by a plurality rather
   than a majority. In reaction, the Congress passed a bill in July 1866
   that required state legislatures to elect senators by an absolute
   majority.^[23]

   By the 1890s, support for the introduction of direct election for the
   Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts.
   On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the direct election
   of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892.^[24] In 1908,
   Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators
   on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska.^[25]
   Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had
   non-binding primaries for Senate candidates,^[26] in which the
   candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as
   advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote;^[26]
   reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.

   William Randolph Hearst opened a nationwide popular readership for
   direct election of U.S. Senators in a 1906 series of articles using
   flamboyant language attacking “The Treason of the Senate” in his
   “Cosmopolitan Magazine”. David Graham Philips, one of those yellow
   journalists Teddy Roosevelt called “muckrakers”, described Nelson
   Aldrich of Rhode Island as the principal “traitor” among the “scurvy
   lot” in control of the Senate by theft, perjury and bribes corrupting
   the state legislatures to gain election to the Senate. A few state
   legislatures began to petition the Congress for direct election of
   senators. By 1893, the House had the two-thirds vote for just such an
   amendment. However, when the joint resolution reached the Senate, it
   failed from neglect, as it did again in 1900, 1904 and 1908; each time
   the House approved the appropriate resolution, and each time it died in
   the Senate.^[27]

   On the second national legislative front, reformers worked towards a
   constitutional amendment, which was strongly supported in the House of
   Representatives but initially opposed by the Senate—Bybee notes that
   the state legislatures, who would lose power if the reforms went
   through, were supportive of the campaign. By 1910, 31 state
   legislatures had passed resolutions calling for a constitutional
   amendment allowing direct election, and in the same year ten Republican
   senators who were opposed to reform were forced out of their seats,
   acting as a "wake-up call to the Senate".^[26]

   Reformers included William Jennings Bryan, while opponents counted
   respected figures such as Elihu Root and George Frisbie Hoar amongst
   their number; Root cared so strongly about the issue that after the
   passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, he refused to stand for
   re‑election to the Senate.^[13] Bryan and the reformers argued for
   popular election through highlighting perceived flaws with the existing
   system, specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks, and through
   arousing populist sentiment. Most important was the populist argument;
   that there was a need to "Awaken, in the senators...a more acute sense
   of responsibility to the people", which it was felt they lacked;
   election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism that was
   out of step with the wishes of the American people, and one that had
   led to the Senate becoming "a sort of aristocratic body – too far
   removed from the people, beyond their reach, and with no special
   interest in their welfare".^[28]

   Hoar replied that the people were both a less permanent and a less
   trusted body than state legislatures, and that moving the
   responsibility for the election of senators to them would see it
   passing into the hands of a body that "[lasted] but a day" before
   changing. Other counterarguments were that renowned senators could not
   have been elected directly, and that since a large number of senators
   had experience in the House, which was already directly elected, a
   constitutional amendment would be pointless.^[29] It was also seen as a
   threat to the rights and independence of the states, who were
   "sovereign, entitled...to have a separate branch of Congress...to which
   they could send their ambassadors". This was countered by the argument
   that a change in the mode in which senators were elected would not
   change their responsibilities.^[30]

   The Senate freshman class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers.
   Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators had been elected through
   party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More
   than half of the states had some form of primary selection for the
   Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth
   Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it
   first was presented to the Senate in 1826.^[31]

   By 1912, 239 political parties at both the state and national level had
   pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the
   use of direct primaries.^[32] Twenty-seven states had called for a
   constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to
   reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood
   that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were
   expected to support the motion, while Alabama and Wyoming, already
   states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without
   formally calling for one.^[33]

Proposal and ratification[edit]

Proposed by the Congress[edit]

   In 1911, the House of Representatives passed House Joint Resolution 39
   proposing a constitutional amendment for direct election of senators.
   However, it included a “race rider” meant to bar federal intervention
   in cases of racial discrimination among voters. When the resolution
   came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider,
   as proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of
   64 to 24, with 4 not voting.^[34] Nearly a year later, the House
   accepted the change. The conference report that would become the
   Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12,
   1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.

Effect[edit]

   Gilded Age monopolies could no longer control the U.S. Senate (left) by
   corrupting state legislatures (right).

   The Seventeenth Amendment altered the process for electing United
   States Senators and changed the way vacancies would be filled. Under
   the original constitutional provision, state legislatures filled
   vacancies when a Senator left office before the end of the term; the
   Seventeenth Amendment provides that state legislatures can grant
   governors the right to make temporary appointments, which last until a
   special election is provided to fill the seat. The power to call such
   an election can also be granted to the governor.^[41] It also had an
   immediate and dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S.
   Senate.^[42]

   Before the Supreme Court required one-man one-vote in a 1964 case,
   rural counties and cities could be given equal weight in the state
   legislatures, enabling one rural vote to equal 200 city votes. The
   malapportioned state legislatures would have given the Republicans
   control of the Senate in the 1916 Senate elections. With direct
   election, each vote represented equally, the Democrats retained control
   of the Senate.^[43]

   The reputation of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to
   decline as the Senate joined the House of Representatives implementing
   popular reforms. Judge Bybee has argued that the amendment led to
   complete "ignominy" for state legislatures without the props of a
   state-based check on Congress. Progressive measures were enacted to
   enable the federal government to supersede the discredited states
   repeatedly over decades.^[1]

   New Deal legislation is another example of expanding federal regulation
   overruling the state legislatures promoting their local state interests
   in coal, oil, corn and cotton.^[44] Ure agrees, saying that not only is
   each Senator now free to ignore his state's interests, Senators "have
   incentive to use their advice-and-consent powers to install Supreme
   Court justices who are inclined to increase federal power at the
   expense of state sovereignty".^[45] Over the first half of the 20th
   century, with a popularly elected Senate confirming nominations both
   Republican and Democratic, the Supreme Court began to apply the Bill of
   Rights to state law, overturning it wherever it harmed individual state
   citizens by applying the Fourteenth Amendment.^[46]

First direct elections to the Senate[edit]

   Oklahoma, admitted to statehood in 1907, chose a Senator by legislative
   election three times: twice in 1907, when admitted, and once in 1908.
   In 1912, Oklahoma reelected Robert Owen by advisory popular vote.^[47]

   New Mexico, admitted to statehood in 1912, chose only its first two
   Senators legislatively. Arizona, admitted to statehood in 1912, chose
   its first two Senators by advisory popular vote. Alaska, and Hawaii,
   admitted to statehood in 1959, have never chosen a U.S. Senator
   legislatively.^[47]

   The first direct elections to the Senate following the Seventeenth
   Amendment being adopted were:^[47]
     * In Maryland on November 4, 1913: a class 1 special election due to
       a vacancy, for a term ending in 1917.
     * In Alabama on May 11, 1914: a class 3 special election due to a
       vacancy, for a term ending in 1915.
     * Nation-wide in 1914: All 32 class 3 senators, term 1915–1921
     * Nation-wide in 1916: All 32 class 1 senators, term 1917–1923
     * Nation-wide in 1918: All 32 class 2 senators, term 1919–1925

Interpretation and advocacy for reform[edit]

   In Trinsey v. Pennsylvania (1991),^[48] the United States Court of
   Appeals for the Third Circuit was faced with a situation where,
   following the death of Senator H. John Heinz III of Pennsylvania,
   Governor Robert P. Casey had provided for a replacement and for a
   special election that did not include a primary.^[49] A voter and
   prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey, Jr., argued that the lack of a
   primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under
   the Fourteenth Amendment.^[50] These arguments were rejected by the
   Third Circuit, which ruled that the Seventeenth Amendment does not
   require primaries.^[51]

   Another subject of analysis is whether statutes restricting the
   authority of governors to appoint temporary replacements are
   constitutional. Vikram Amar, writing in the Hastings Constitutional Law
   Quarterly, claims that Wyoming's requirement that its governor fill a
   senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of the same party as the
   person who vacated that Senate seat violates the Seventeenth
   Amendment.^[52] This is based on the text of the Seventeenth Amendment,
   which states that "the legislature of any state may empower the
   executive thereof to make temporary appointments". The amendment only
   empowers the legislature to delegate the authority to the governor and,
   once that authority has been delegated, does not permit the legislature
   to intervene. The authority is to decide whether or not the governor
   shall have the power to appoint temporary senators, not in what fashion
   he should do so.^[53] Sanford Levinson, in his rebuttal to Amar, argues
   that rather than engaging in a textual interpretation, those examining
   the meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in the
   fashion that provides the most benefit, and that legislatures being
   able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a
   substantial benefit to the states.^[54]

   Due to the controversy over the impact of the Seventeenth Amendment,
   there has been advocacy for both reform and repeal of the Seventeenth
   Amendment. With the commencement of the Obama Administration in 2009,
   four sitting Democratic senators left the Senate for executive branch
   positions: Barack Obama (President), Joe Biden (Vice President),
   Hillary Rodham Clinton (Secretary of State), and Ken Salazar (Secretary
   of the Interior). Controversies developed about the successor
   appointments made by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and New York
   Governor David Paterson. This created interest in abolishing Senate
   appointment by the governor.^[55] Accordingly, Senator Russ Feingold of
   Wisconsin^[56] and Representative David Dreier of California proposed
   an amendment to remove this power; Senators John McCain and Dick Durbin
   became co-sponsors, as did Representative John Conyers.^[55] The Tea
   Party movement has been at the forefront of the campaign to repeal the
   Seventeenth Amendment entirely, arguing that it would protect states'
   rights and reduce the power of the federal government.^[57]

References[edit]

    1. ^ ^a ^b Bybee (1997) p.535. This was partially fueled by the
       Senators; he wrote in the Northwestern University Law Review:

     Politics, like nature, abhorred a vacuum, so senators felt the
     pressure to do something, namely enact laws. Once senators were no
     longer accountable to and constrained by state legislatures, the
     maximizing function for senators was unrestrained; senators almost
     always found in their own interest to procure federal legislation,
     even to the detriment of state control of traditional state
     functions.

   46. ^ Kochan (2003) p.1053 Donald J. Kochan, for an article in the
       Albany Law Review, analyzed the effect of the Seventeenth Amendment
       on Supreme Court decisions over the constitutionality of state
       legislation. He found a "statistically significant difference" in
       the number of cases holding state legislation unconstitutional
       before and after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, with the
       number of holdings of unconstitutionality increasing sixfold.
       Besides the 17th Amendment, decline in the influence of the states
       also followed economic changes. Zywicki observes that interest
       groups of all kinds began to focus efforts on the federal
       government, as national issues could not be directed by influencing
       only a few state legislatures of with Senators of the most
       seniority chairing the major committees. He attributes the rise in
       the strength of interest groups partially to the development of the
       U.S. economy on an interstate, national level. See Zywicki (1997)
       p.215. Ure also argues that the Seventeenth Amendment led to the
       rise of special interest groups to fill the void; with citizens
       replacing state legislators as the Senate's electorate, with
       citizens being less able to monitor the actions of their Senators,
       the Senate became more susceptible to pressure from interest
       groups, who in turn were more influential due to the centralization
       of power in the federal government; an interest group no longer
       needed to lobby many state legislatures, and could instead focus
       its efforts on the federal government. See Ure (2007) p.293
