Toponymy and composition[edit]

   The name of the United States' East Coast derives from the idea of the
   United States as having two distinct coastlines, one at its west and
   one at its east. Other terms to refer to this area by cardinal
   direction include the term "Eastern Seaboard" and simply East Coast.
   The region is also commonly referred to as the "Atlantic Coast" or
   "Atlantic Seaboard" due to the coastline being against the Atlantic
   Ocean.^[citation needed]

   The fourteen states which have shoreline on the eastern seaboard of the
   United States are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New
   Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
   Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
   Georgia, and Florida.^[1] Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, and
   Vermont have no Atlantic coastlines, but they are grouped with the
   Eastern Seaboard states.^[by whom?]^[2]

Colonial history[edit]

   Twelve of the original Thirteen Colonies of the United Kingdom in North
   America that later become the original states of the United States,
   each founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia), lay along the
   East Coast.^[a] Two additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not
   among the original Thirteen Colonies: Maine (settled by the French, but
   later became part of British colony of Massachusetts in 1677)^[3] and
   Florida (originally settled by the French; which traded hands between
   the British and Spanish until 1821).^[4] The Middle Colonies (New
   Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware) had been owned by the
   Dutch as New Netherland until they were captured by the British in the
   mid-to-late 17th century.^[citation needed]

Climate and physical geography[edit]

   The are three basic climate regions on the East Coast from north to
   south: The region from Maine south to northeastern North Carolina is a
   temperate climate with a hot summers and cool (in areas from NYC south)
   to cold (areas north of NYC) winters. The region from southern North
   Carolina south to central Florida is a subtropical climate with mild
   winters and long hot summers. The southern part of Florida is tropical,
   with a wet season in summer and dry season in winter with small
   temperature changes annually.

   The seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane
   season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although
   hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.^[5] Hurricanes Hazel,
   Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more
   significant storms to have affected the region.

   The East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.^[6] It has been
   shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation as far south as New York, with
   offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the
   nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the
   result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of
   Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides
   terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated
   from the Piedmont districts by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the
   East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation, prominent
   sites of cities.

Demographics[edit]

   In 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East
   Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total
   population).^[7]

Transportation[edit]

   The primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate
   95.^[8] I-95 (completed in the late 1970s) replaced the historic U.S.
   Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),^[9]^[10] which was the original federal
   highway that traversed all east coast states (except
   Delaware).^[11]^[12] By water, the east coast is connected from
   Norfolk, Virginia to Miami, Florida by the Intracoastal Waterway, also
   known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.^[13]^[14]
   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger
   rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only
   high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and
   Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train
   and air passenger market.^[15]^[16]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ Those colonies were New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode
       Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New
       Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
       Carolina, and Georgia. Pennsylvania is the 13th colony, excluded
       here because it accesses the coast only via the Delaware River.
