   Issues that affect water supply and sanitation in the United States
   include water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns
   about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly
   retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as
   a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe
   droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water
   supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.^[8]^[9]
   Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans
   whose communities depend on surface water.^[10] As for drinking water
   quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead,
   perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking
   water quality in the U.S. is good.

   Cities, utilities, state governments and the federal government have
   addressed the above issues in various ways. To keep pace with demand
   from an increasing population, utilities traditionally have augmented
   supplies. However, faced with increasing costs and droughts, water
   conservation is beginning to receive more attention and is being
   supported through the federal WaterSense program. The reuse of treated
   wastewater for non-potable uses is also becoming increasingly common.
   Pollution through wastewater discharges, a major issue in the 1960s,
   has been brought largely under control.

   Most Americans are served by publicly owned water and sewer utilities.
   Eleven percent of Americans receive water from private (so-called
   “investor-owned”) utilities. In rural areas, cooperatives often provide
   drinking water. Finally, up to 15 percent of Americans are served by
   their own wells.^[11]^[12] Water supply and wastewater systems are
   regulated by state governments and the federal government. At the state
   level, health and environmental regulation is entrusted to the
   corresponding state-level departments. Public Utilities Commissions or
   Public Service Commissions regulate tariffs charged by private
   utilities. In some states they also regulate tariffs by public
   utilities. At the federal level, drinking water quality and wastewater
   discharges are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency, which also provides funding to utilities through State
   Revolving Funds.^[13]^[14]^[15]

   Water consumption in the United States is more than double that in
   Central Europe, with large variations among the states. In 2002 the
   average American family spent $474 on water and sewerage charges,^[2]
   which is about the same level as in Europe. The median household spent
   about 1.1 percent of its income on water and sewerage.^[16]

History[edit]

   In the 19th century numerous American cities were afflicted with major
   outbreaks of disease, including cholera in 1832, 1849 and 1866 and
   typhoid in 1848.^[17] The fast-growing cities did not have sewers and
   relied on contaminated wells within the city confines for drinking
   water supply. In the mid-19th century many cities built centralized
   water supply systems. However, initially these systems provided raw
   river water without any treatment. Only after John Snow established the
   link between contaminated water and disease in 1854 and after
   authorities became gradually convinced of that link, water treatment
   plants were added and public health improved. Sewers were built since
   the 1850s, initially based on the erroneous belief that bad air (miasma
   theory) caused cholera and typhoid. It took until the 1890s for the now
   universally accepted germ theory of disease to prevail.

   However, most wastewater was still discharged without any treatment,
   because wastewater was not believed to be harmful to receiving waters
   due to the natural dilution and self-purifying capacity of rivers,
   lakes and the sea. Wastewater treatment only became widespread after
   the introduction of federal funding in 1948 and especially after an
   increase in environmental consciousness and the upscaling of financing
   in the 1970s. For decades federal funding for water supply and
   sanitation was provided through grants to local governments. After 1987
   the system was changed to loans through revolving funds.

Piped water supply until 1948[edit]

   In the 1840s and 1850s the largest cities in the U.S. built pipelines
   to supply drinking water from rivers or lakes. However, the drinking
   water was initially not treated, since the link between waterborne
   pathogens and diseases was not yet well known. In 1842 New York City
   was one of the first cities in the U.S. to tap water resources outside
   the city limits. It dammed the Croton River in Westchester County, New
   York, and built an aqueduct from the reservoir to the city.^[18] Also
   in 1842, construction was completed on Chicago's first water works,
   with water mains made of cedar and a water intake located about 150
   feet (46 m) into Lake Michigan.^[19] In 1848, Boston began construction
   of a water transmission system. A tributary of the Sudbury River was
   impounded creating Lake Cochituate, from where the Cochituate Aqueduct
   transported water to the Brookline Reservoir that fed the city’s
   distribution system.^[20] In 1853 Washington, DC, followed suit by
   beginning the construction of the Washington Aqueduct to provide water
   from the Great Falls on the Potomac River.

   In 1854, the British physician John Snow found that cholera was spread
   through contaminated water. As a result of his findings, several cities
   began to treat all water with sand filters and chlorine before
   distributing it to the public. Cities also began to construct
   sewers.^[21] As a result of water treatment and sanitation, the
   incidence of cholera and typhoid rapidly decreased. Slow sand
   filtration was initially the technology of choice for water treatment,
   later being gradually displaced by rapid sand filtration.

   In the arid American Southwest, the water demand of rapidly growing
   cities such as Los Angeles exceeded local water availability, requiring
   the construction of large pipelines to bring in water from far-away
   sources. The most spectacular example is the first Los Angeles Aqueduct
   built between 1905 and 1913 to supply water from the Owens Valley over
   a distance of 375 km.

Sanitation until 1948[edit]

   Most of the first sewer systems in the United States were built as
   combined sewers (carrying both storm water and sewerage). They
   discharged into rivers, lakes and the sea without any treatment. The
   main reason for choosing combined sewers over separate systems
   (separating sanitary sewers from storm water drains) was a belief that
   combined sewer systems were cheaper to build than separate systems.
   Also, there was no European precedent for successful separate sewer
   systems at the time.^[17] The first large-scale sewer systems in the
   United States were constructed in Chicago and Brooklyn in the late
   1850s, followed by other major U.S. cities.^[17]

   Few sewage treatment facilities were constructed in the late 19th
   century to treat combined wastewater because of the associated
   difficulties. There were only 27 U.S. cities with wastewater treatment
   works by 1892, most of them "treating" wastewater through land
   application. Of these 27 cities, 26 had separate sanitary and storm
   water sewer systems, thus facilitating wastewater treatment, because
   there was no need for large capacitites to accommodate wet weather
   flows. Furthermore, there was a belief that the diluted combined
   wastewater was not harmful to receiving waters, due to the natural
   dilution and self-purifying capacity of rivers, lakes and the sea.^[17]
   In the early 20th century a debate evolved between those who thought it
   was in the best interest of public health to construct wastewater
   treatment facilities and those who believed building them was
   unnecessary. Nevertheless, many cities began to opt for separate sewer
   systems, creating favorable conditions for adding wastewater treatment
   plants in the future.^[17]

   Where wastewater was being treated it was typically discharged into
   rivers or lakes. However, in 1932, the first reclaimed water facility
   in the U.S. was built in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, for the reuse
   of treated wastewater in landscape irrigation.

   Sanitary sewers were not the only sanitation solution applied. They
   were particularly useful in high-density urban areas. However, in some
   newly built lower-density areas, decentralized septic systems were
   built. They were attractive because they reduced capital expenditures
   and had fewer operation and maintenance costs compared to wastewater
   treatment plants.^[17]

After 1948: Enter the federal government[edit]

   In the first half of the 20th century water supply and sanitation were
   a local government responsibility with regulation at the state level;
   the federal government played almost no role in the sector at that
   time. This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution
   Control Act of 1948, which provided for comprehensive planning,
   technical services, research, and financial assistance by the federal
   government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure.
   The Act was amended in 1965, establishing a uniform set of water
   quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control
   Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do
   so.^[17] Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and
   sanitation were introduced in the 1970s, in reaction to an increase in
   environmental concerns. In 1970 the Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) was created. In 1972, the Clean Water Act was passed, requiring
   industrial plants to proactively improve their waste procedures in
   order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources. In
   1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of
   public water systems. This law specified a number of contaminants that
   must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed
   the maximum contaminant levels allowed. From then on, drinking water
   systems were closely monitored by federal, state, and municipal
   governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations.^[21]
   The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water
   pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion
   in research and construction grants. The funds initially provided an
   incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment
   infrastructure instead of decentralized systems.”^[17] However, the
   1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider
   alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems, and
   financial assistance was made available.^[17] In the mid-1990s
   decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S.
   population, and approximately 37 percent of new housing
   developments.^[22]

   There were disagreements between the federal government and local
   government about the appropriate level of wastewater treatment, with
   the former arguing for more stringent standards. For example, in the
   late 1980s, the City of San Diego and the Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) were involved in a legal dispute over the requirement to
   treat sewage at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant to secondary
   standards. The City prevailed, saying that it saved ratepayers an
   estimated $3 billion and that process had proved successful in
   maintaining a healthy ocean environment. The city’s Point Loma
   Wastewater Treatment Plant uses an advanced primary process.^[23] The
   requirement to perform secondary treatment on wastewater before ocean
   discharge was waived by the EPA in 1995, "taking into account the
   city's unique circumstances".^[24]

   In 1987 Congress, through the Water Quality Act, passed an amendment of
   the Clean Water Act, abolishing construction grants and replacing them
   by a system of subsidized loans using the Clean Water State Revolving
   Fund (CWSRF). The intention at the time was to completely phase out
   federal funding after a few years. Funding peaked in 1991 and continued
   at high levels thereafter, despite the original intentions. New
   challenges arose, such as the need to address combined sewer overflows
   for which EPA issued a policy in 1994. In 1997 Congress established the
   Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, building on the success of the
   CWSRF, in order to finance investments to improve compliance with more
   stringent drinking water quality standards.

Technical and environmental overview[edit]

   This section provides a brief overview of the water supply and
   sanitation infrastructure in the U.S., water sources of some of the
   main cities, and the main types of residential water use.

Infrastructure[edit]

   The centralized drinking water supply infrastructure in the United
   States consists of dams and reservoirs, well fields, pumping stations,
   aqueducts for the transport of large quantities of water over long
   distances, water treatment plants, reservoirs in the distribution
   system (including water towers), and 1.8 million miles of distribution
   lines.^[25] Depending on the location and quality of the water source,
   all or some of these elements may be present in a particular water
   supply system. In addition to this infrastructure for centralized
   network distribution, 14.5% of Americans rely on their own water
   sources, usually wells.^[11]^[12]

   The centralized sanitation infrastructure in the U.S. consists of 1.2
   million miles of sewers - including both sanitary sewers and combined
   sewers -, sewage pumping stations and 16,024 publicly owned wastewater
   treatment plants.^[26] In addition, at least 17% of Americans are
   served by on-site sanitation systems such as septic tanks.^[27]

   Publicly owned wastewater treatment plants serve 189.7 million people
   and treat 32.1 billion gallons per day.^[26] 9,388 facilities provide
   secondary treatment, 4,428 facilities provide advanced treatment, and
   2,032 facilities do not discharge.^[26] There are 176 facilities that
   provide a treatment level that is less than secondary. These include
   facilities with ocean discharge waivers, and treatment facilities
   discharging to other facilities meeting secondary treatment or better.
   880 facilities receive flows from combined sewer systems.^[26] About
   772 communities in the U.S. have combined sewer systems, serving about
   40 million people.^[28]

Water sources[edit]

   The Wachusett Reservoir is a source of drinking water supply for Boston

   About 90% of public water systems in the U.S. obtain their water from
   groundwater. However, since systems served by groundwater tend to be
   much smaller than systems served by surface water, only 34% of
   Americans (101 million) are supplied with treated groundwater, while
   66% (195 million) are supplied with surface water.^[10]

   For a surface water system to operate without filtration it has to
   fulfill certain criteria set by the EPA under its Surface Water
   Treatment Rule, including the implementation of a watershed control
   program. The water system of New York City has repeatedly fulfilled
   these criteria.^[29]

Cities supplied primarily by surface water without water treatment[edit]

   Boston, New York City, San Francisco, Denver, and Portland, Oregon are
   among the large cities in the U.S. that do not need to treat their
   surface water sources beyond disinfection, because their water sources
   are located in the upper reaches of protected watersheds and thus are
   naturally very pure.^[30] Boston receives most of its water from the
   Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs and the Ware River in central and
   western Massachusetts. New York City's water supply is fed by a
   2,000-square-mile (5,200 km^2) watershed in the Catskill Mountains. The
   watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the
   United States.^[31] San Francisco obtains 85% of its drinking water
   from high Sierra snowmelt through the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in
   Yosemite National Park.^[32] However, to supplement the imported water
   supply, and to help maintain delivery of drinking water in the event of
   a major earthquake, drought or decline in the snowpack, San Francisco
   considers the use of alternative locally produced, sustainable water
   sources such as reclaimed water for irrigation, local groundwater and
   desalination during drought periods, all as part of its Water Supply
   Diversification Program.^[33] The largest source of water supply for
   Portland, Oregon, is the Bull Run Watershed.^[34] Denver receives its
   water almost entirely from mountain snowmelt in a number of highly
   protected watersheds in more than 9 counties. Its water is stored in 14
   reservoirs, the largest of which is the Dillon Reservoir on the Blue
   River in the Colorado River. Water is diverted from there through the
   Harold D. Roberts Tunnel under the Continental Divide into the South
   Platte River Basin.^[35]

Cities supplied primarily by surface water with water treatment[edit]

   Lake Havasu on the Colorado River is the secondary source of drinking
   water for Phoenix, Arizona, supplying about 40% of Phoenix's water
   supply. 50% comes from the watersheds of the Verde and Salt Rivers,
   according to the official website of the City of Phoenix Water Services
   Department. Los Angeles also obtains a significant percentage of its
   water supply from Lake Havasu.

   Cities that rely on more or less polluted surface water from the lower
   reaches of rivers have to rely on extensive and costly water
   purification plants. The Las Vegas Valley obtains 90% of its water from
   Lake Mead on the Colorado River, which has been affected by
   drought.^[36] To supply a portion of the future water supply, Las Vegas
   plans to buy water rights in the Snake Valley in White Pine County,
   250 mi (400 km) north of the city straddling the Utah border and other
   areas, pumping it to Las Vegas through a US$2 billion pipeline.^[37]
   Phoenix draws about half of its drinking water from the Salt
   River–Verde River watershed, and about 40% from the Colorado River
   further downstream at Lake Havasu through the Central Arizona Project.
   Los Angeles obtains about half of its drinking water from the Owens
   River and Mono Lake through the Los Angeles Aqueduct,^[38] with
   additional supplies from Lake Havasu through the Colorado River
   Aqueduct.^[39] San Diego imports nearly 90 percent of its water from
   other areas, specifically northern California and the Colorado
   River.^[40]
   The Schuylkill River provides 40% of the water used in Philadelphia

   The cities on the Mississippi River are supplied by water from that
   river except for Memphis. The metropolitan area of Atlanta receives 70%
   of its water from the Chattahoochee River and another 28% from the
   Etowah, Flint, Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers.^[41] Chicago is supplied by
   water from Lake Michigan and Detroit receives its water from the
   Detroit River.^[42] Philadelphia receives 60% of its water from the
   Delaware River and 40% from the Schuylkill River.^[43] Washington, D.C.
   receives its water from the Potomac River through the Washington
   Aqueduct.^[44]

Cities supplied primarily by groundwater[edit]

   Miami and its metropolitan area obtain drinking water primarily from
   the Biscayne Aquifer. Given increasing water demand, Miami-Dade County
   is considering the use of reclaimed water to help preserve the Biscayne
   Aquifer.^[45] Memphis receives its water from artesian aquifers.^[46]
   San Antonio draws the bulk of its water from the Edwards
   Aquifer;^[47]^[48] it did not use any surface water until 2006.^[49]

Cities supplied by a mix of groundwater and surface water[edit]

   Seventy-one percent of Houston's supply flows from the Trinity River
   into Lake Livingston, and from the San Jacinto River into Lake Conroe
   and Lake Houston. Deep underground wells drilled into the Evangeline
   and Chicot aquifers provide the other 29 percent of the city’s water
   supply.^[50]

Water use[edit]

   Toilets account for 31% of indoor water use in the U.S.

   Domestic water use (also called home or residential water use) in the
   United States was estimated by the United States Geological Survey at
   29.4 billion US gallons (111,000,000 m^3) per day in 2005.^[1] The bulk
   of domestic water is provided through public networks. 13% or
   3.8 billion US gallons (14,000,000 m^3) of water is self-supplied.^[1]
   The average domestic water use per person in the U.S. is 98-US-gallon
   (370 L) per day.^[1] This is about 2.5 times as high as in England (150
   Liter)^[51] and three times as high as in Germany (126
   Liter).^[52]^[53]

   One of the reasons for the high domestic water use in the U.S. is the
   high share of outdoor water use. For example, the arid West has some of
   the highest per capita domestic water use, largely because of landscape
   irrigation. Per capita domestic water use varied from 51-US-gallon
   (190 L) per day in Maine to 189-US-gallon (720 L) per day in
   Nevada.^[1] According to a 1999 study, on average all over the U.S. 58%
   of domestic water use is outdoors for gardening, swimming pools etc.
   and 42% is used indoors.^[54] Indoor use falls into the following
   categories:
     * 31% Toilets
     * 2% Baths
     * 19% Showers
     * 25% Clothes Washers
     * 2% Dishwashers
     * 18% Faucets
     * 3% Other Domestic Uses^[54]

   Only a very small share of public water supply is used for drinking.
   According to one 2002 survey of 1,000 households, an estimated 56% of
   Americans drank water straight from the tap and an additional 37% drank
   tap water after filtering it.^[55] 74% of Americans said they bought
   bottled water.^[55] According to a non-representative survey conducted
   among 216 parents (173 Latinos and 43 non-Latinos), 63 (29%) never
   drank tap water. The share is much higher among Latinos (34%) than
   among non-Latinos (12%). The study concluded that many Latino families
   avoid drinking tap water because they fear it causes illness, resulting
   in greater cost for the purchase of bottled and filtered water.^[56]
   This notion is also repeated among Asians.^[56]

Institutional overview[edit]

Service providers[edit]

   The California Aqueduct brings water from Northern to Southern
   California
   See also: List of United States water companies

   The United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies a Public
   Water System (PWS) as provide water for human consumption through pipes
   or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or
   serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year.
   EPA has defined three types of public water systems: 1) Community Water
   System (CWS): A public water system that supplies water to the same
   population year-round. 2) Non-Transient Non-Community Water System
   (NTNCWS): A public water system that regularly supplies water to at
   least 25 of the same people at least six months per year, but not
   year-round. Some examples are schools, factories, office buildings, and
   hospitals which have their own water systems. 3)Transient Non-Community
   Water System (TNCWS): A public water system that provides water in a
   place such as a gas station or campground where people do not remain
   for long periods of time.^[57]

   In 2007 there were about 155,000 PWSs in the United States, of which
   52,000 CWSs. PWSs are either publicly owned, cooperatives or privately
   owned,^[6] serving a total of about 242 million people in 2000.^[58]
   Four thousand systems provide water in localities with more than 10,000
   inhabitants, and the remaining 50,000 systems provide water in
   localities with less than 10,000 inhabitants.^[6] In 2000 15% of
   Americans (43.5 million people) relied on their own water source,
   usually a well, for drinking water.^[1]^[59]

   Utilities in charge of public water supply and sanitation systems can
   be owned, financed, operated and maintained by a public entity, a
   private company or both can share responsibilities through a
   public-private partnership. Utilities can either be in charge of only
   water supply and/or sanitation, or they can also be in charge of
   providing other services, in particular electricity and gas. In the
   latter case they are called multi-utilities. Bulk water suppliers are
   entities that manage large aqueducts and sell either treated or
   untreated water to various users, including utilities.

   Public service providers. Eighty-nine percent of Americans served by a
   public water system are served by a public or cooperative
   entity.^[60]^[61] Usually public systems are managed by utilities that
   are owned by a city or county, but have a separate legal personality,
   management and finances. Examples are the District of Columbia Water
   and Sewer Authority, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and
   Denver Water. In some cases public utilities span several
   jurisdictions. An example is the Washington Suburban Sanitary
   Commission that spans two counties in Maryland. Utility cooperatives
   are a major provider of water services, especially in small towns and
   rural areas^[62]^[63]

   Private utilities. About half of American drinking water utilities, or
   about 26,700, are privately owned, providing water to 11% of Americans
   served by public water systems.^[60] Most of the private utilities are
   small, but a few are large and are traded on the stock exchange. The
   largest private water company in the U.S. is American Water, which
   serves 15 million customers in 1,600 communities in the U.S. and
   Canada.^[64] It is followed by United Water, which serves 7 million
   customers and is owned by the French firm Suez Environnement.^[65]
   Overall, about 33.5 million Americans (11% of the population) get water
   from a privately owned drinking water utility.^[60] In addition, 20% of
   all wastewater utilities in the U.S. are privately owned, many of them
   relatively small. About 3% of Americans get wastewater service from
   private wastewater utilities. In addition, more than 1,300 government
   entities (typically municipalities) contract with private companies to
   provide water and/or wastewater services.^[60]

   Multi-utilities. Some utilities in the U.S. provide only water and/or
   sewer services, while others are multi-utilities that also provide
   power and gas services. Examples of utilities that provide only water
   and sewer services are the Boston Water and Sewer Commission, Dallas
   Water Utilities, the New York City Department of Environmental
   Protection, Seattle Public Utilities and the Washington Suburban
   Sanitary Commission. Other utilities, such as the San Francisco Public
   Utilities Commission, provide power in addition to water and sewer
   services. Other multi-utilities provide power and water services, but
   no sewer services, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and
   Power and the Orlando Utilities Commission. There are also some
   utilities that provide only sewer services, such as the Metropolitan
   Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago or the sewer utility in
   the city of Santa Clara.^[66]
   The Central Arizona Project supplies water to 80 municipal, industrial,
   agricultural and Indian customers in Central and Southern Arizona

   Bulk water suppliers. There are also a few large bulk water suppliers
   in the arid Southwest of the United States, which sell water to
   utilities. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD)
   sells treated water from the Colorado River and Northern California to
   its member utilities in Southern California through the California
   Aqueduct. Twenty-six cities and water districts serving 18 million
   people are members of MWD.^[67] The Central Arizona Water Conservation
   district supplies water from the Colorado River to 80 municipal,
   industrial, agricultural and Indian customers in Central and Southern
   Arizona through the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct (CAP).^[68]

Regulators[edit]

   The economic regulation of water and sanitation service providers in
   the U.S. (in particular in relation to the setting of user water rates)
   is usually the responsibility of regulators such as Public Utility
   Commissions at the state level, which are organized in the National
   Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.^[69] (see economic
   regulator). However, while all investor-owned utilities are subject to
   tariff regulation, only few public utilities are subjected to the same
   regulation. In fact, only 12 states have laws restricting pricing
   practices by public water and sanitation utilities.^[70]

   The environmental and drinking water quality regulation is the
   responsibility of state departments of health or environment and the
   EPA.^[71]

Other stakeholders[edit]

   There are a number of Professional associations, trade associations and
   other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are actively engaged
   in water supply and sanitation.

   Professional associations include the American Water Works Association
   (AWWA) oriented mainly towards drinking water professionals and the
   Water Environment Federation (WEF) geared mainly at wastewater
   professionals. The geographical scope of both is greater than the U.S.:
   AWWA has members in 100 countries,^[72] with a focus on the U.S. and
   Canada, and WEF has member associations in 30 countries.^[73]

   There are a number of trade associations in the sector, including:
     * The National Association of Water Companies (NAWC), founded in
       1895, which represents the interests of small and large private
       water and wastewater utilities;^[74]
     * The National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), founded
       in 1970, which represents the interests of wastewater
       utilities;^[75]
     * The National Rural Water Association (NRWA), founded in 1976, which
       represents small water and wastewater utilities;^[62]
     * The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA), founded in
       1981, which represents the interests of large publicly owned
       drinking water utilities.^[76]
     * The Water Reuse Association, founded in 2000, which promotes water
       reclamation, recycling, reuse and desalination.^[77]
     * The Water Quality Association represents manufacturers and dealers
       of equipment for water treatment.^[78]

   In addition to lobbying, some of these trade associations also provide
   public education, as well as training and technical assistance to their
   members.^[79]^[80]

   An example of an NGO active in water supply and sanitation is Food &
   Water Watch, a consumer rights group created in 2005 which focuses on
   corporate and government accountability relating to food, water, and
   fishing. Another example is the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE),
   which was created in 2007 with seed funding from the EPA to “advocate
   for water efficiency research, evaluation, and education” at the
   national level. Its Board members “represent water utilities,
   environmental organizations, plumbing and appliance associations,
   irrigation manufacturers, the academic community, government, and
   others.”^[81]

Issues[edit]

   Among the main issues facing water users and the water industry in the
   U.S. in 2009 are water scarcity and adaptation to climate change;
   concerns about combined sewer overflows and drinking water quality; as
   well as concerns about a gap between investment needs and actual
   investments. Other issues are concerns about a swiftly retiring
   workforce, the affordability of water bills for the poor during a
   recession, and water fluoridation, which is opposed by some mainly on
   ethical and safety grounds.

Water scarcity and climate change[edit]

   With water use in the United States increasing every year, many regions
   are starting to feel the pressure. At least 36 states are anticipating
   local, regional, or statewide water shortages by 2013, even under
   non-drought conditions.^[82]

   According to the National Academies, climate change affects water
   supply in the U.S. in the following ways:
     * Rising water demands. Hotter summers mean thirstier people and
       plants. In addition, more evaporation from reservoirs and irrigated
       farmland will lead to faster depletion of water supplies.
     * Increased drought. Scientific evidence suggests that rising
       temperatures in the southwestern United States will reduce river
       flows and contribute to an increased severity, frequency, and
       duration of droughts.
     * Seasonal supply reductions. Many utilities depend on winter
       snowpack to store water and then gradually release it through
       snowmelt during spring and summer. Warmer temperatures will
       accelerate snowmelt, causing the bulk of the runoff to occur
       earlier and potentially increasing water storage needs in these
       areas.^[9]

Pollution[edit]

   Sewer overflows. Combined sewer overflows (CSO) and sanitary sewer
   overflows affect the quality of water resources in many parts of the
   U.S. About 772 communities have combined sewer systems, serving about
   40 million people, mostly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes Region and
   the Pacific Northwest.^[28] CSO discharges during heavy storms can
   cause serious water pollution. A 2004 EPA report to Congress estimated
   that there are 9,348 CSO outflows in the U.S., discharging about
   850 billion US gallons (3.2×10^9 m^3) of untreated wastewater and storm
   water to the environment.^[83] EPA estimates that between 23,000 and
   75,000 sanitary sewer overflows occur each year, resulting in releases
   of between 3 and 10 billion US gallons (38,000,000 m^3) of untreated
   wastewater.^[83]

   The increased frequency and intensity of rainfall as a result of
   climate change^[8]^[84] will result in additional water pollution from
   wastewater treatment, storage, and conveyance systems."^[84] For the
   most part, wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflow
   control programs have been designed on the basis of the historic
   hydrologic record, taking no account of prospective changes in flow
   conditions due to climate change.^[84]
   Main article: Drinking water quality in the United States

   Drinking water quality. There are several aspects of drinking water
   quality that are of some concern in the United States, including
   Cryptosporidium,^[85] disinfection by-products, lead, perchlorates and
   pharmaceutical substances. However, in almost all cases drinking water
   quality is in conformity with the norms of the Safe Drinking Water Act,
   which sets Maximum Contaminant Levels for pollutants. In addition, the
   EPA's Consumer Confidence Rule of 1998 requires most public water
   suppliers to provide consumer confidence reports, also known as annual
   water quality reports, to their customers.^[86] According to the EPA,
   each year by July 1 anyone connected to a public water system should
   receive in the mail an annual water quality report that tells where
   water in a specific locality comes from and what's in it. Consumers can
   find out about these local reports on a map provided by EPA.^[87] 29%
   of Americans are reading their water quality reports. Customers are
   generally satisfied with the information they are receiving from their
   water companies and their local or state environmental offices.^[55]

Investment gap[edit]

   In its Infrastructure Report Card the American Society of Civil
   Engineers gave both the U.S. drinking water and wastewater
   infrastructure a grade of D- in 2005, down from D in 2001. According to
   the report, "the nation's drinking water system faces a staggering
   public investment need to replace aging facilities, comply with safe
   drinking water regulations and meet future needs."^[88] Investment
   needs are about $19 billion/year for sanitation and $14 billion/year
   for drinking water, totaling $33 billion/year.^[89] State and local
   governments invested $28.5 billion in water supply and sanitation in
   2005, split roughly half and half between water and sanitation.^[3]^[4]
   This implies an investment gap of $4.5 billion/year. If tariff revenues
   remain constant in real terms, utilities face a funding gap of the same
   magnitude. However, the funding gap would disappear if municipalities
   increased water and sanitation spending at a real rate of growth of
   three percent per year.^[89]

   As of 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers report card remains
   a "D", and a recent paper from Stanford University's Center for
   Reinventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) describes
   why "water infrastructure is systemically resistant to innovation":

     Despite a growing sense that water will be as important a global
     issue as energy in the coming century, capital deployed for water
     resources "pales in comparison to that for renewable energy." ...
     Only 5 percent of the $4.3 billion in VC money invested in the clean
     tech industry goes to water technologies.

     Federal support is also on the decline. The membranes that today
     enable desalinization and water reuse, for example, were the fruits
     of R&D undertaken during the Kennedy administration. We now spend
     ten times less on that research.^[90]

   The paper notes that innovations occur when utilities see opportunities
   for "short-term benefits and immediate savings," when there are water
   shortages, and in quality of life situations, like Philadelphia's
   "green infrastructure initiative designed to reduce combined sewer
   overflow."^[90]

   Concerning drinking water supply the EPA estimated in 2003 that $276.8
   billion would have to be invested between 2003 and 2023.^[91]^[92]
   Concerning sanitation, the EPA estimated in 2007 that investment of
   $202.5 billion is needed over the next 20 years to control wastewater
   pollution. This includes $134 billion for wastewater treatment and
   collection, $54.8 billion for resolving unsatisfactory combined sewer
   overflows and $9 billion for stormwater management.^[93] The EPA needs
   surveys do not capture all investment needs, in particular concerning
   capital replacement.^[89]

Access[edit]

   More than 99% of the U.S. population has access to "complete plumbing
   facilities", defined as the following services within the housing unit:
     * hot and cold piped water,
     * bathtub or shower, and
     * flush toilet.

   However, more than 1.7 million people in the United States, 670,986
   households, still lack basic plumbing facilities. More than a third of
   them have household incomes below the federal poverty level. They are
   spread across all racial and ethnic categories, but they are more
   prominent in the minority groups. Most of the people who lacked
   plumbing services were elderly, poor, and living in rural areas. Alaska
   has the highest percentage of households without plumbing – 6.32
   percent of all its households.^[94]

Pricing and affordability[edit]

   Water meters are a prerequisite for accurate, volumetric billing of
   water users

   The median household in the U.S. spent about 1.1% of its income on
   water and sewerage in 2002. However, poor households face a different
   situation: In 1997 18% of U.S. households, many of them poor, paid more
   than 4% of their income on their water and sewer bill.^[95]

   The mean U.S. water tariff - excluding sewer tariffs - was $2.72 per
   1,000 gallons ($0.72 per cubic meter) in 2000,^[96] with significant
   variations between localities. Average residential water tariffs for a
   monthly consumption of 15 cubic meters varied between $0.35 per cubic
   meter in Chicago and $3.01 in Atlanta in 2007. The combined water and
   sewer tariff was $0.64 in Chicago and $3.01 in Atlanta, with Atlanta
   not charging separately for sewer services.^[97] Annual combined water
   and sewer bills vary between $228 in Chicago and $1,476 in Atlanta in
   2008.^[98] For purposes of comparison, the average water and sewer bill
   in England and Wales in 2008 was equivalent to $466.^[99]

   The average annual increase in typical residential water bills was
   approximately 5.3 percent from 2001 through 2009, while the increase in
   typical residential sewer bills was approximately 5.5 percent according
   to data from the 50 Largest Cities Water and Wastewater Rate Survey by
   Black & Veatch.^[100]

Retiring workforce[edit]

   The water community in the US is faced with a swiftly retiring
   workforce and a tightening market place for new workers. In 2008,
   approximately one third of executives and managers were expected to
   retire in the following five years.^[101] Water and sanitation
   utilities in the United States had 41,922 employees in 2002.^[102]

Fluoridation[edit]

   Water fluoridation, the controlled addition of moderate concentrations
   of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay, is used for
   about two-thirds of the U.S. population on public water systems.^[103]
   Almost all major public health and dental organizations support water
   fluoridation, or consider it safe.^[104] Nevertheless it is contentious
   for ethical, safety, and efficacy reasons.^[105]

Responses to address issues[edit]

Supply-side management[edit]

   Historically the predominant response to increasing water demand in the
   U.S. has been to tap into ever more distant sources of conventional
   water supply, in particular rivers. Because of environmental concerns
   and limitations in the availability of water resources, including
   droughts that may be due to climate change, this approach now is in
   many cases not feasible any more. Still, supply-side management is
   often being pursued tapping into non-conventional water resources, in
   particular seawater desalination in coastal areas with high population
   growth. California alone had plans to build 21 desalination plants in
   2006 with a total capacity of 450 million US gallons (1,700,000 m^3)
   per day, which would represent a massive 70-fold increase over current
   seawater desalination capacity in the state.^[106] In 2007 the largest
   desalination plant in the United States is the one at Tampa Bay,
   Florida, which began desalinating 25 million US gallons (95,000 m^3) of
   water per day in December 2007.^[107]

   In 2005 over 2,000 desalination plants with a capacity of more than
   100m3/day had been installed or contracted in every state in the U.S.
   with a total capacity of more than 6 million m3/day. Only 7% of that
   capacity was for seawater desalination, while 51% used brackish water
   and 26% used river water as water source.^[108] The contracted capacity
   corresponds to 2.4% of total municipal and industrial water use in the
   country in 2000.^[109] The actual share of desalinated water is lower,
   because some of the contracted capacity was never built or never
   operated, was closed down or is not operated at full capacity.^[108]

Demand-side management[edit]

   Demand-side management, including the reduction of leakage in the
   distribution network and water conservation, are other options that are
   being considered and, in some cases, also applied to address water
   scarcity. For example, Seattle has reduced per capita water use from
   152 US gallons (580 L) per day in 1990 to 97 US gallons (370 L) per day
   in 2007 through a comprehensive water conservation program including
   pricing policies, education, regulations and rebates for water-saving
   appliances. Other cities such as Atlanta and Las Vegas have also
   launched water conservation programs that are somewhat less
   comprehensive than the one in Seattle concerning indoor water use.
   However, Las Vegas has intentionally focused on curbing outdoor water
   demand, which accounts for 70% of residential water use in the city,
   through reductions in turf area and incentives for the use of rains
   sensors, irrigation controllers and pool covers.^[110] At the federal
   level, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 set standards for water-efficient
   appliances, replacing the 3.5 US gallons (13 L) per flush (gpf) toilet
   with a new 1.6 gpf/6 litres per flush maximum standard for all new
   toilets. By 1994, federal law mandated that showerheads and faucets
   sold in the U.S. release no more than 2.5 and 2.2 US gallons (8.3 L) of
   water per minute respectively.^[111] Also in 1994 the AWWA established
   a clearinghouse for water conservation, efficiency, and demand
   management, called WaterWiser, to assist water conservation
   professionals and the general public in using water more
   efficiently.^[112] In 2006 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   launched the WaterSense program to encourage water efficiency beyond
   the standards set by the Energy Policy Act through the use of a special
   label on consumer products.^[113]^[114]

   Distributional losses in the U.S. are typically 10-15% of total
   withdrawals, although they can exceed 25% of total water use in older
   systems.^[110] According to another source unaccounted-for water (UFW)
   - which includes system losses, water used for firefighting and water
   used in the treatment process - was estimated to be only 8% in systems
   with more than 500,000 connections in 2000.^[115] In comparison, the
   level of water losses is 7% in Germany, 19% in England and Wales, and
   26% in France. Together with Germany water losses in the U.S. are thus
   among the lowest in 16 industrial countries.^[116]

   Low water tariffs and inappropriate tariff structures do not encourage
   water conservation. For example, decreasing-block rates, under which
   the unit rate decreases with consumption, offer hardly any incentive
   for water conservation. In 2000 about 51% of water tariffs in the
   U.S.were uniform (i.e. the unit tariff is independent of the level of
   consumption), 12% were increasing-block tariffs (the unit rate
   increases with consumption) and 19% were decreasing-block tariffs.^[96]
   The use of decreasing-block tariffs declined sharply from 45% of all
   tariff structures in 1992.^[70] Sewer rates are often flat rates that
   are not linked to consumption, thus offering no incentive to conserve
   water.^[110]

Water reuse[edit]

   Reuse of reclaimed water is an increasingly common response to water
   scarcity in many parts of the United States. Reclaimed water is being
   reused directly for various non-potable uses in the United States,
   including urban landscape irrigation of parks, school yards, highway
   medians and golf courses; fire protection; commercial uses such as
   vehicle washing; industrial reuse such as cooling water, boiler water
   and process water; environmental and recreational uses such as the
   creation or restoration of wetlands; as well as agricultural
   irrigation.^[117] In some cases, such as in Irvine Ranch Water District
   in Orange County it is also used for flushing toilets.^[118] It was
   estimated that in 2002 a total of 1.7 billion US gallons
   (6,400,000 m^3) per day, or almost 3% of public water supply, were
   being directly reused. California reused 0.6 and Florida 0.5 billion US
   gallons (1,900,000 m^3) per day respectively. Twenty-five states had
   regulations regarding the use of reclaimed water in 2002.^[117] Planned
   direct reuse of reclaimed water was initiated in 1932 with the
   construction of a reclaimed water facility at San Francisco's Golden
   Gate Park. Reclaimed water is typically distributed with a color-coded
   dual piping network that keeps reclaimed water pipes completely
   separate from potable water pipes.^[119]

Pollution control[edit]

   Numerous efforts have been undertaken in the United States to control
   the pollution of water resources and to make drinking water safe. The
   most comprehensive federal regulations and standards for the water
   treatment industry were implemented in the 1970s, in reaction to a huge
   increase in environmental concerns in the country. In 1972, Congress
   passed the Clean Water Act, with the unprecedented goal of eliminating
   all water pollution by 1985 and authorized expenditures of $24.6
   billion in research and construction grants.^[120] In 1974, Congress
   passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, specifying a number of contaminants
   that had to be closely monitored and reported to residents should they
   exceed the maximum contaminant levels.^[121] Both Acts were
   complemented by substantial federal grant funding to improve
   infrastructure in the form of construction grants.

   In 1987 Congress, through the Water Quality Act, passed an amendment of
   the Clean Water Act, abolishing construction grants and replacing them
   by a system of subsidized loans using the Clean Water State Revolving
   Fund. The intention at the time was to completely phase out federal
   funding after a few years. Funding for the CWSRF peaked in 1991 and
   continued at high levels thereafter, despite the original
   intentions.^[122] New challenges arose, such as the need to address
   combined sewer overflows for which EPA issued a policy in 1994. In 1997
   Congress established the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, in order
   to finance investments to improve compliance with more stringent
   drinking water quality standards.

   Today cities make significant investments in the control of combined
   sewer overflows, including through the construction of storage
   facilities in the sewerage system in order to allow for the subsequent
   controlled release of sewage into treatment plants.

Federal assistance[edit]

   The United States Congress approves federal funding for water and
   sanitation, including through State Revolving Funds.

   One way to address the funding needs of utilities to respond to the
   various challenges they face without increasing the burden of water
   bills on users is federal financial assistance.

   Centralized water and sanitation infrastructure is typically financed
   through utilities’ own revenue or debt. Debt can be in the form of soft
   loans from State Revolving Funds (SRF), credits from commercial Banks
   or – in the case of large utilities - from bonds issued directly in the
   capital market. In the case of water supply (i.e. excluding
   sanitation), 42% of investments were financed by private sector
   borrowing, 39% by current revenues, 13% by government loans including
   the Drinking Water SRF, 5% by government grants and 1% from other
   sources.^[5] Although federal funding for the main of the two SRFs has
   declined in real terms by 70% between its peak in 1991 and 2006, SRFs
   play an important role in financing water and sanitation
   investments.^[122]^[123]^[124] There are two SRFs: The larger Clean
   Water State Revolving Fund, created in 1987,^[125]^[126]^[127] and the
   smaller Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, created in 1997.^[26] They
   receive federal and state contributions and issue bonds. In turn, they
   provide soft loans to utilities in their respective states, with
   average interest rates at 2% for up to 20 years in the case of the
   Clean Water State Revolving Fund. In addition to the SRFs, the United
   States Department of Agriculture provides grants, loans and loan
   guarantees for water supply and sanitation in small communities (those
   with less than 10,000 inhabitants), together with technical assistance
   and training.^[128]

   The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of February 17, 2009,
   provides $4 billion for the Clean Water SRF, $2 billion for the
   Drinking Water SRF and, among others, $126 million for water recycling
   projects through the United States Bureau of Reclamation.^[129]

   This exceeds previous levels of financing, since Congress approved only
   US$1.5 billion of federal funding for State Revolving Funds in 2008.
   This was much below the historical average of US$3 billion/year for the
   Clean Water State Revolving Fund (1987–2006)^[126]^[130] and US$ 1.2
   billion/year for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund
   (1997–2005).^[26] The share of federal funding for sanitation has
   declined from almost 50% in the early 1980s to about 20% in the early
   1990s.^[131]
