   A first-generation programming language (1GL) is a machine-level
   programming language.^[1]

   Originally, no translator was used to compile or assemble the
   first-generation language. The first-generation programming
   instructions were entered through the front panel switches of the
   computer system.

   A first generation (programming) language (1GL) is a grouping of
   programming languages that are machine level languages used to program
   first-generation computers. The instructions were given through the
   front panel switches of these computers, directly to the CPU. There was
   originally no compiler or assembler to process the instructions in 1GL.

   The instructions in 1GL are made of binary numbers, represented by 1s
   and 0s. This makes the language suitable for the understanding of the
   machine but very much more difficult to interpret and learn by the
   human programmer.

   The main advantage of programming in 1GL is that the code can run very
   fast and very efficiently, precisely because the instructions are
   executed directly by the CPU. One of the main disadvantages of
   programming in a low level language is that when an error occurs, the
   code is not as easy to fix.

   First generation languages are very much adapted to a specific computer
   and CPU, and code portability is therefore significantly reduced in
   comparison to higher level languages.

   Modern day programmers still occasionally use machine level code,
   especially when programming lower level functions of the system, such
   as drivers, interfaces with firmware and hardware devices. Modern
   tools, such as native-code compilers are used to produce machine level
   from a higher-level language.
