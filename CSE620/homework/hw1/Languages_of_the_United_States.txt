   Many languages are used, or historically have been used in the United
   States. The most commonly used language is English. There are also many
   languages indigenous to North America or to U.S. states or holdings in
   the Pacific region. Languages brought to the country by colonists or
   immigrants from Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world make up a
   large portion of the languages currently used; several languages,
   including creoles and sign languages, have also developed in the United
   States. Approximately 337 languages are spoken or signed by the
   population, of which 176 are indigenous to the area. Fifty-two
   languages formerly spoken in the country's territory are now
   extinct.^[4]

   The most common language in the United States is known as American
   English. English is the de facto national language of the United
   States, with 80% of the population claiming it as a mother tongue, and
   some 95% claiming to speak it "well" or "very well".^[5] However, no
   official language exists at the federal level. There have been several
   proposals to make English the national language in amendments to
   immigration reform bills,^[6]^[7] but none of these bills has become
   law with the amendment intact. The situation is quite varied at the
   state and territorial levels, with some states mirroring the federal
   policy of adopting no official language in a de jure capacity, others
   adopting English alone, others officially adopting English as well as
   local languages, and still others adopting a policy of de facto
   bilingualism.

   Since the 1965 Immigration Act, Spanish is the second most common
   language in the country, and is spoken by approximately 35 million
   people.^[8] The United States holds the world's fifth largest
   Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Spain,
   Colombia, and Argentina. Throughout the Southwestern United States,
   long-established Spanish-speaking communities coexist with large
   numbers of more recent Hispanophone immigrants. Although many new Latin
   American immigrants are less than fluent in English, nearly all
   second-generation Hispanic Americans speak English fluently, while only
   about half still speak Spanish.^[9]

   According to the 2000 US census, people of German ancestry make up the
   largest single ethnic group in the United States, and the German
   language ranks fifth.^[10]^[11] Italian, Polish, and French are still
   widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those
   countries in the early 20th century, but the use of these languages is
   dwindling as the older generations die. Russian is also spoken by
   immigrant populations.

   Tagalog and Vietnamese have over one million speakers each in the
   United States, almost entirely within recent immigrant populations.
   Both languages, along with the varieties of the Chinese language,
   Japanese, and Korean, are now used in elections in Alaska, California,
   Hawaii, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Washington.^[12]

   Native American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country,
   but these populations are decreasing, and the languages are almost
   never widely used outside of reservations. Hawaiian, although having
   few native speakers, is an official language along with English at the
   state level in Hawaii. The state government of Louisiana offers
   services and documents in French, as does New Mexico in Spanish.
   Besides English, Spanish, French, German, Navajo and other Native
   American languages, all other languages are usually learned from
   immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned
   through some form of education.

   Additionally, modern estimates indicate that American Sign Language is
   signed by as many as 500,000 Americans.^[18]

   The total sample size for these figures is 286 million people.

Official language status[edit]

   The United States does not have a national official language;
   nevertheless, English (specifically American English) is the primary
   language used for legislation, regulations, executive orders, treaties,
   federal court rulings, and all other official pronouncements; although
   there are laws requiring documents such as ballots to be printed in
   multiple languages when there are large numbers of non-English speakers
   in an area.

   As part of what has been called the English-only movement, some states
   have adopted legislation granting official status to English. As of
   January 2014^[update], out of 50 states, 28 had established English as
   the official language, and Hawaii had established both English and
   Hawaiian as official.

   In 2014, three more states, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey,
   considered enacting English as their official state language.^[19]

States that are de facto bilingual[edit]

     * Louisiana (English and French legally recognized, although there is
       no official language) (1974)
     * New Mexico (English and Spanish both de facto)^[31]

Status of other languages[edit]

   The state of Alaska provides voting information in Iñupiaq, Central
   Yup'ik, Gwich'in, Siberian Yupik, Koyukon, and Tagalog, as well as
   English.

   California has agreed to allow the publication of state documents in
   other languages to represent minority groups and immigrant communities.
   Languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, Persian, Russian,
   Vietnamese, and Thai appear in official state documents, and the
   Department of Motor Vehicles publishes in 9 languages.^[32]

   In New Mexico, although the state constitution does not specify an
   official language, laws are published in English and Spanish, and
   government materials and services are legally required (by Act) to be
   made accessible to speakers of both languages.^[33]

   Contrary to belief, the state of Pennsylvania was never officially
   bilingual. The state has a history of Pennsylvania Dutch German
   language communities that goes back to the 1650s. There were attempts
   to recognize German in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries due
   to the prevalence of German speakers in the state. This situation
   prevailed until the 1950s in some rural areas.^[citation needed]

   The state of New York had state government documents (i.e., vital
   records) co-written in the Dutch language until the 1920s, in order to
   preserve the legacy of New Netherland, though England annexed the
   colony in 1664.^[citation needed]

   Native American languages are official or co-official on many of the
   U.S. Indian reservations and pueblos. In Oklahoma before statehood in
   1907, territory officials debated whether or not to have Cherokee,
   Choctaw and Muscogee languages as co-official, but the idea never
   gained ground.

   The issue of bilingualism also applies in the states of Arizona and
   Texas, while the constitution of Texas has no official language policy.
   Arizona passed a proposition in the November 7, 2006 general election
   declaring English as the official language.^[34] Nonetheless, Arizona
   law requires the distribution of voting ballots in languages such as
   Navajo and Tohono O'odham in certain counties.^[35]

   In 2000, the census bureau printed the standard census questionnaires
   in six languages: English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese (in traditional
   characters), Vietnamese, and Tagalog.

Indigenous languages[edit]

Native American languages[edit]

   Native American languages predate European settlement of the New World.
   In a few parts of the U.S. (mostly on Indian reservations), they
   continue to be spoken fluently. Most of these languages are endangered,
   although there are efforts to revive them. Normally the fewer the
   speakers of a language the greater the degree of endangerment, but
   there are many small Native American language communities in the
   Southwest (Arizona and New Mexico) which continue to thrive despite
   their small size. In 1929, speaking of indigenous Native American
   languages, linguist Edward Sapir observed:

     "Few people realize that within the confines of the United States
     there is spoken today a far greater variety of languages ... than in
     the whole of Europe. We may go further. We may say, quite literally
     and safely, that in the state of California alone there are greater
     and more numerous linguistic extremes than can be illustrated in all
     the length and breadth of Europe."^[36]

   According to the 2000 Census and other language surveys, the largest
   Native American language-speaking community by far is the Navajo.
   Navajo is an Athabascan language with 178,000 speakers, primarily in
   the states of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, in addition to smaller
   numbers of speakers across the country. Dakota is a Siouan language
   with 18,000 speakers in the US alone (22,000 including speakers in
   Canada), not counting 6,000 speakers of the closely related Lakota.
   Most speakers live in the states of North Dakota and South Dakota.
   Central Alaskan Yup'ik is an Eskimo-Aleut language with 16,000
   speakers, most of whom live in Alaska. Cherokee belongs to the
   Iroquoian language family, and had about 22,000 speakers as of
   2005.^[37]

   The Cherokee have the largest tribal affiliation in the U.S., but most
   are of mixed ancestry and do not speak the language. Recent efforts to
   preserve and increase the Cherokee language in Oklahoma and the
   Cherokee Indian reservation in North Carolina have been productive.
   Western Apache, with 12,500 speakers, is a Southern Athabaskan language
   closely related to Navajo, but not mutually intelligible with it. Most
   speakers live in Arizona. The O'odham language, spoken by the Pima and
   the Tohono O'odham, is a Uto-Aztecan language with more than 12,000
   speakers, most of whom live in central and southern Arizona and
   northern Sonora.

   Choctaw has 11,000 speakers. One of the Muskogean language family, like
   Seminole and Alabama. Keres has 11,000 speakers. A language isolate,
   the Keres are the largest of the Pueblo nations. The Keres pueblo of
   Acoma is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United
   States. Zuni has 10,000 speakers. Zuni is a language isolate mostly
   spoken in a single pueblo, Zuni, the largest in the U.S. Ojibwe has
   7,000 speakers (about 55,000 including speakers in Canada). The
   Algonquian language family includes populous languages like Cree in
   Canada.

   Many other languages have been spoken within the current borders of the
   United States. The following is a list of 28 language families (groups
   of demonstrably related languages) indigenous to the territory of the
   continental United States.
     * Algic
     * Alsean
     * Athabaskan
     * Caddoan
     * Chimakuan
     * Chinookan
     * Chumashan

     * Comecrudan
     * Eskimo–Aleut
     * Iroquoian
     * Kalapuyan
     * Maiduan
     * Muskogean

                       * Palaihnihan
                       * Plateau Penutian
                       * Pomoan
                       * Salishan
                       * Shastan
                       * Siouan

                       * Yokutsan
                       * Yuman

   In addition to the above list of families, there are many languages in
   the United States that are sufficiently well-known to attempt to
   classify but which have not been shown to be related to any other
   language in the world. These 25 language isolates are listed below.
   With further study, some of these will likely prove to be related to
   each other or to one of the established families. There are also larger
   and more contentious proposals such as Penutian and Hokan.
     * Adai
     * Atakapa
     * Cayuse
     * Chimariko
     * Chitimacha
     * Coahuilteco
     * Esselen

   Since the languages in the Americas have a history stretching for about
   17,000 to 12,000 years, current knowledge of American languages is
   limited. There are doubtless a number of languages that were spoken in
   the Americas that are missing from historical record.

Native American sign languages[edit]

   A sign-language trade pidgin, known as Plains Indian Sign Language or
   Plains Standard, arose among the Plains Indians. Each signing nation
   had a separate signed version of their oral language, that was used by
   the hearing, and these were not mutually intelligible. Plains Standard
   was used to communicate between these nations. It seems to have started
   in Texas and then spread north, through the Great Plains, as far as
   British Columbia. There are still a few users today, especially among
   the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. Unlike other sign languages developed
   by hearing people, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign
   languages.

Austronesian languages[edit]

Hawaiian[edit]

   Hawaiian is an official state language of Hawaii as prescribed in the
   Constitution of Hawaii. Hawaiian has 1,000 native speakers. Formerly
   considered critically endangered, Hawaiian is showing signs of language
   renaissance. The recent trend is based on new Hawaiian language
   immersion programs of the Hawaii State Department of Education and the
   University of Hawaii, as well as efforts by the Hawaii State
   Legislature and county governments to preserve Hawaiian place names. In
   1993, about 8,000 could speak and understand it; today estimates range
   up to 27,000. Hawaiian is related to the Māori language spoken by
   around 150,000 New Zealanders and Cook Islanders as well as the
   Tahitian language which is spoken by another 120,000 people of Tahiti.

Samoan[edit]

   Samoan is an official territorial language of American Samoa. Samoans
   make up 90% of the population, and most people are bilingual.

Chamorro[edit]

   Chamorro is co-official in the Mariana Islands, both in the territory
   of Guam and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In
   Guam, the indigenous Chamorro people make up about 60% of the
   population.

Carolinian[edit]

   Carolinian is also co-official in the Northern Marianas, where only 14%
   of people speak English at home.

Main languages[edit]

   A trash can in Seattle labeled in four languages: English, Chinese
   (垃圾), Vietnamese (should be rác), and Spanish. Tagalog also uses the
   Spanish word.

   Some of the first European languages to be spoken in the U.S. are
   English, Dutch, German, French, and Spanish.

   From the mid-19th century on, the nation had large numbers of
   immigrants who spoke little or no English, and throughout the country
   state laws, constitutions, and legislative proceedings appeared in the
   languages of politically important immigrant groups. There have been
   bilingual schools and local newspapers in such languages as German,
   Ukrainian, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Greek, Polish,
   Swedish, Romanian, Czech, Japanese, Yiddish, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Welsh,
   Cantonese, Bulgarian, Dutch, Portuguese and others, despite opposing
   English-only laws that, for example, illegalized church services,
   telephone conversations, and even conversations in the street or on
   railway platforms in any language other than English, until the first
   of these laws was ruled unconstitutional in 1923 (Meyer v. Nebraska).

   Currently, Asian languages account for the majority of languages spoken
   in immigrant communities: Korean, the varieties of Chinese, and various
   Indian or South Asian languages like Punjabi, Hindi/Urdu, Kannada,
   Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, as well as
   Arabic, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Persian, and others.

   Typically, immigrant languages tend to be lost through assimilation
   within two or three generations, though there are some groups such as
   the Cajuns (French), Pennsylvania Dutch (German) in a state where large
   numbers of people were heard to speak it before the 1950s, and the
   original settlers of the Southwest (Spanish) who have maintained their
   languages for centuries.

English[edit]

   Main article: American English
   English language distribution in the United States.

   English was inherited from British colonization, and it is spoken by
   the majority of the population. It serves as the de facto official
   language, the language in which government business is carried out.
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau 80% spoke only English at Home and
   all but 57,097,826 of U.S. residents speak English "well" or "very
   well".^[39]

   American English is different from British English in terms of spelling
   (a classic example being the dropped "u" in words such as
   color/colour), grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and slang usage. The
   differences are not usually a barrier to effective communication
   between an American English and a British English speaker, but there
   are certainly enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings,
   usually surrounding slang or region dialect differences.^[citation
   needed]

   Some states, like California, have amended their constitutions to make
   English the only official language, but in practice, this only means
   that official government documents must at least be in English, and
   does not mean that they should be exclusively available only in
   English. For example, the standard California Class C driver's license
   examination is available in 32 different languages.^[40]

Spanish[edit]

   Main article: Spanish language in the United States
   Spanish language distribution in the United States.

   Spanish was also inherited from colonization and is sanctioned as
   official in the territory of Puerto Rico. Spanish is also taught in
   various regions as a second language, especially in areas with large
   Hispanic populations such as the Southwestern United States along the
   border with Mexico, as well as Florida, parts of California, the
   District of Columbia, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. In Hispanic
   communities across the country, bilingual signs in both Spanish and
   English may be quite common. Furthermore, numerous neighborhoods exist
   (such as Washington Heights in New York City or Little Havana in Miami)
   in which entire city blocks will have only Spanish language signs and
   Spanish-speaking people.

   In addition to Spanish-speaking Hispanic populations, younger
   generations of non-Hispanics in the United States seem to be learning
   Spanish in larger numbers due to the growing Hispanic population and
   increasing popularity of Latin American movies and music performed in
   the Spanish language. A 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the
   United States Census Bureau, showed that Spanish is the primary
   language spoken at home by over 35 million people aged 5 or older,^[13]
   making the United States the world's fifth-largest Spanish-speaking
   community, outnumbered only by Mexico, Spain, Colombia, and
   Argentina.^[41]^[42]

   Spanglish is a code-switching variant of Spanish and English and is
   spoken in areas with large bilingual populations of Spanish and English
   speakers, such as along the Mexico – United States border (California,
   Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), Florida, and New York City.

French[edit]

   Main article: French language in the United States
   French language distribution in the United States. Counties and
   parishes marked in yellow are those where 6% to 12% of the population
   speak French at home; brown, 12% to 18%; red, over 18%. Cajun French
   and French-based creole languages are not included even though the
   Creole dialects are spoken throughout the U.S. and taught in many U.S.
   schools.

   French, the fourth most-common language (when Chinese dialects are
   combined), is spoken mainly by the Louisiana Creole, native French,
   Cajun, Haitian, and French-Canadian populations. It is widely spoken in
   Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and in Louisiana, with notable
   Francophone enclaves in St. Clair County, Michigan, many rural areas of
   the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the northern San Francisco Bay
   area.

   Three varieties of French developed within what is now the United
   States in colonial times: Louisiana French, Missouri French, and New
   England French (essentially a variant of Canadian French).^[43] French
   is the second de facto language in the states of Louisiana (where the
   French dialect of Cajun predominates) and Maine. The largest
   French-speaking communities in the United States reside in Northeast
   Maine; Hollywood and Miami, Florida; New York City;^[citation needed]
   certain areas of rural Louisiana; and small minorities in Vermont and
   New Hampshire. Many of the New England communities are connected to the
   dialect found across the border in Quebec or New Brunswick. More than
   13 million Americans possess primary French heritage, but only 2
   million speak French or French Creole at home.

German[edit]

   Main article: German language in the United States
   See also: Hutterite German, Texas German, Pennsylvania Dutchified
   English and Plautdietsch
   German language distribution in the United States.

   German was a widely spoken language in some of the colonies, especially
   Pennsylvania, where a number of German-speaking religious minorities
   settled to escape persecution in Europe. Another wave of settlement
   occurred when Germans fleeing the failure of 19th Century German
   revolutions emigrated to the United States. A large number of these
   German immigrants settled in the urban areas, with neighborhoods in
   many cities being German-speaking and numerous local German language
   newspapers and periodicals established. German farmers also took up
   farming around the country, including the Texas Hill Country, at this
   time. The language was widely spoken until the United States entered
   World War I.

   In the early twentieth century, German was the most widely studied
   foreign language in the United States, and prior to World War I, more
   than 6%^[citation needed] of American school-children received their
   primary education exclusively in German, though some of these Germans
   came from areas outside of Germany proper. Currently, more than 49
   million Americans claim German ancestry, the largest self-described
   ethnic group in the U.S., but less than 4% of them speak a language
   other than English at home, according to the 2005 American Community
   Survey.^[44] The Amish speak a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania
   German. One reason for this decline of German language was the
   perception during both World Wars that speaking the language of the
   enemy was unpatriotic; foreign language instruction was banned in
   places during the First World War. Unlike earlier waves, they were more
   concentrated in cities, and integrated quickly.

   There is a myth (known as the Muhlenberg Vote) that German was to be
   the official language of the U.S., but this is inaccurate and based on
   a failed early attempt to have government documents translated into
   German.^[45] The myth also extends to German being the second official
   language of Pennsylvania; however, Pennsylvania has no official
   language. Although more than 49 million Americans claim they have
   German ancestors, only 1.24 million Americans speak German at home.
   Many of these people are either Amish and Mennonites or Germans having
   newly immigrated (e.g. for professional reasons).

Chinese[edit]

   Main article: Chinese language in the United States

   Over 2.6 million Americans speak some variety of Chinese, making it the
   third most-spoken language in the country. Until the late 20th century,
   Yue dialects including Taishanese and Cantonese were the most common
   among immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, especially in
   California. Since the opening of the People's Republic of China,
   Standard Chinese (Mandarin), the official language in the PRC and
   Taiwan, has become increasingly prevalent.^[46] Many young Americans
   not of Chinese or Taiwanese descent have become interested in learning
   Mandarin.^[46]

   In New York City at least, although Mandarin is spoken as a native
   language among only 10% of Chinese speakers, it is used as a secondary
   dialect among the greatest number of them and is on its way to replace
   Cantonese as their lingua franca.^[47]

Tagalog[edit]

   Tagalog language distribution in the United States.

   Tagalog speakers were already present in the United States as early as
   the late sixteenth century as sailors contracted by the Spanish
   colonial government. In the eighteenth century, they established
   settlements in Louisiana, such as Saint Malo. After the American
   annexation of the Philippines, the number of Tagalog speakers steadily
   increased, as Filipinos began to migrate to the U.S. as students or
   contract laborers. Their numbers, however, decreased upon Philippine
   independence, as many Filipinos were repatriated.

   Today, Tagalog, together with its standardized form Filipino, is spoken
   by over a million and a half Filipino Americans, and is promoted by
   Filipino American civic organizations and Philippine consulates. As
   Filipinos are the second largest Asian ethnic group in the United
   States, Tagalog is the second most spoken Asian language in the
   country. Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English,
   is also spoken by a number of Filipino Americans.

   Tagalog is also taught at some universities where a significant number
   of Filipinos exist. As it is the national and most spoken language of
   the Philippines, most Filipinos in the United States are proficient in
   Tagalog in addition to their local regional language.

Vietnamese[edit]

   Spread of the Vietnamese language in the United States

   According to the 2010 Census, there are over 1.5 million Americans who
   identify themselves as Vietnamese in origin, ranking fourth among the
   Asian American groups and forming the largest Overseas Vietnamese
   population.

   Orange County, California is home to the largest concentration of
   ethnic Vietnamese outside Vietnam, especially in its Little Saigon
   area. Other significant Vietnamese communities are found in the
   metropolitan areas of San Jose, Houston, Seattle, Northern Virginia,
   and New Orleans. Similarly to other overseas Vietnamese communities in
   Western countries (except France), the Vietnamese population in the
   United States was established following the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and
   communist takeover of South Vietnam following the Vietnam War.

Italian[edit]

   Main article: Italian language in the United States
   Current distribution of the Italian language in the United States.

   The Italian language and its various dialects has been widely spoken in
   the United States for more than one hundred years, primarily due to
   large-scale immigration from the late 19th century to the mid 20th
   century.

   In addition to Standard Italian learned by most people today, there has
   been a strong representation of the dialects and languages of Southern
   Italy amongst the immigrant population (Sicilian and Neapolitan in
   particular). As of 2009, though 15,638,348 American citizens report
   themselves as Italian Americans, only 753,992 of these report speaking
   the Italian language at home (0.3264% of the population).

Arabic[edit]

   Main article: Arabic in the United States

   Arabic is spoken by immigrants from the Middle East as well as many
   Muslim Americans. The highest concentrations of native Arabic speakers
   reside in heavily urban areas like Chicago, New York City, and Los
   Angeles. Detroit and the surrounding areas of Michigan boast a
   significant Arabic-speaking population including many Arab Christians
   of Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian descent.

   Arabic is used for religious purposes by Muslim Americans and by some
   Arab Christians (notably Catholics of the Melkite and Maronite Churches
   as well as Rum Orthodox, i.e. Antiochian Orthodox Christians). A
   significant number of educated Arab professionals who immigrate often
   already know English quite well, as it is widely used in the Middle
   East. Lebanese immigrants also have a broader understanding of French
   as do many Arabic-speaking immigrants from North Africa.

Cherokee[edit]

   Main article: Cherokee language
   Distribution of the Cherokee language

   Cherokee is the Iroquoian language spoken by the Cherokee people, and
   the official language of the Cherokee Nation.^[26] Significant numbers
   of Cherokee speakers of all ages^[48] still populate the Qualla
   Boundary in Cherokee, North Carolina and several counties within the
   Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, significantly Cherokee, Sequoyah, Mayes,
   Adair, and Delaware. Increasing numbers of Cherokee youth are renewing
   interest in the traditions, history, and language of their
   ancestors.^[48] Cherokee-speaking communities stand at the forefront of
   language preservation, and at local schools all lessons are taught in
   Cherokee and thus it serves as the medium of instruction from
   pre-school on up.^[26] Also, church services and traditional ceremonial
   "stomp" dances are held in the language in Oklahoma and on the Qualla
   Boundary in North Carolina.^[26]

Dutch[edit]

   Dutch language distribution in the United States.

   There has been a Dutch presence in America since 1602, when the
   government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands chartered
   the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or
   VOC) with the mission of exploring for a passage to the Indies and
   claiming any uncharted territories for the Dutch republic. In 1664,
   English troops under the command of the Duke of York (later James II of
   England) attacked the New Netherland colony. Being greatly outnumbered,
   director general Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam, with Fort
   Orange following soon. New Amsterdam was renamed New York, Fort Orange
   was renamed Fort Albany. Dutch city names can still be found in New
   York's neighbourhoods. Harlem is Haarlem, Staten Island is Staten
   Eiland and Brooklyn refers to Breukelen.

   Dutch was still spoken in many parts of New York at the time of the
   Revolution. For example, Alexander Hamilton's wife Eliza Hamilton
   attended a Dutch-language church during their marriage.

   African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist Sojourner
   Truth (born 'Isabella Baumfree') was a native speaker of Dutch.

   Martin Van Buren, the first President born in the United States
   following its independence, spoke Dutch as his native language, making
   him the only President whose first language was not English.

   In a 1990 demographic consensus, 3% of surveyed citizens claimed
   descent from Dutch settlers. Modern estimates place the Dutch American
   population at 5 million, lagging just a bit behind Scottish Americans
   and Swedish Americans.

   Notable Dutch Americans include the Roosevelts (Theodore Roosevelt,
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Eleanor Roosevelt), Marlon Brando,
   Thomas Alva Edison, Martin Van Buren and the Vanderbilts. The
   Roosevelts are direct descendants of Dutch settlers of the New
   Netherland colony in the 17th century.

   Around 136,000 people in the United States still speak the Dutch
   language at home today. They are concentrated mainly in California
   (23,500), Florida (10,900), Pennsylvania (9,900), Ohio (9,600), New
   York (8,700) and Michigan (6,600) (i.e. the city of Holland).^[49]

   A vernacular dialect of Dutch, known as Jersey Dutch was spoken by a
   significant number of people in the New Jersey area between the start
   of the 17th century to the mid-20th century. With the beginning of the
   20th century, usage of the language became restricted to internal
   family circles, with an ever-growing number of people abandoning the
   language in favor of English. It suffered gradual decline throughout
   the 20th century, and it ultimately dissipated from casual usage.

Finnish[edit]

   Finnish language distribution in the United States.

   The first Finnish settlers in America were amongst the settlers who
   came from Sweden and Finland to New Sweden colony. Most colonists were
   Finnish. However, the Finnish language was not preserved as well among
   subsequent generations as Swedish.

   Shortly after the Civil War, many Finnish citizens immigrated to the
   United States, mainly in rural areas of the Midwest (and more
   specifically in Michigan's Upper Peninsula). Hancock, Michigan, as of
   2005, still incorporates bi-lingual street signs written in both
   English and Finnish.^[50] Americans of Finnish origin yield at 800,000
   individuals, though only 26,000 speak the language at home. There is a
   distinctive dialect of English to be found in the Upper Peninsula,
   known as Yooper. Yuper often has a Finnish cadence and uses Finnish
   sentence structure with modified English, German, Swedish, Norwegian,
   and Finnish vocabulary. Notable Finnish Americans include Gus Hall,
   U.S. Communist Party leader, Renny Harlin, film director, and the
   Canadian-born actress Pamela Anderson. Another Finnish community in the
   United States is found in Lake Worth, Florida, north of Miami.

Russian[edit]

   Main article: Russian language in the United States
   Russian language distribution in the United States.

   The Russian language is frequently spoken in areas of Alaska, Los
   Angeles, Seattle, Spokane, Miami, San Francisco, New York City,
   Philadelphia, Woodburn, Oregon, and Chicago. The Russian-American
   Company used to own Alaska Territory until selling it after the Crimean
   War. Russian had always been limited, especially after the
   assassination of the Romanov dynasty of tsars. Starting in the 1970s
   and continuing until the mid-1990s, many people from the Soviet Union
   and later its constituent republics such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus,
   and Uzbekistan have immigrated to the United States, increasing the
   language's usage in America.

   The largest Russian-speaking neighborhoods in the United States are
   found in Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island in New York City
   (specifically the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn), parts of Los
   Angeles, particularly West Los Angeles and West Hollywood, parts of
   Philadelphia, particularly the Far Northeast and, parts of Miami like
   Sunny Isles Beach.

   Slavic Voice of America media group serves Russian-speaking Americans
   out of Dallas, TX.

Hebrew[edit]

   Modern Hebrew is used by some immigrants from Israel and Eastern
   Europe. Liturgical Hebrew is used as a religious or liturgical
   language^[51] by many of the United States' approximately 7
   million^[52] Jews.

Ilocano[edit]

   Like the Tagalogs, the Ilocanos are an Austronesian stock which came
   from the Philippines. They were the first Filipinos to migrate en masse
   to the United States. They first entered the State of Hawai'i and
   worked there in the vast plantations.

   As they did in the Philippine provinces of Northern Luzon and Mindanao,
   they quickly gained importance in the areas where they settled. Thus,
   the state of Hawai'i became no less different from the Philippines in
   terms of percentage of Ilocano speakers.

   Like Tagalog, Ilocano is also being taught in universities where most
   of the Filipinos reside.

Indian Languages[edit]

   There are many Indians in the USA, and they speak various Indian
   languages. Major Indian languages spoken in the USA include:Tamil,
   Gujarati, Hindi (over 500,000 people) Punjabi, Marathi and Telugu .

Irish[edit]

   Up to 37 million Americans have Irish ancestry, many of whose ancestors
   would have spoken Irish. According to the 2007 American Community
   Survey, 22,279 people speak Irish at home. As of 2008^[update] it was
   the 76th most spoken language in the USA.^[53]

Khmer (Cambodian)[edit]

   Between 1981 and 1985 about 150,000 Cambodians resettled in the United
   States.^[54] Before 1975 very few Cambodians came to the United States.
   Those who did were children of upper-class families sent abroad to
   attend school. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer
   Rouge in 1975, some Cambodians managed to escape. In 2007 the American
   Community Survey reported that there were approximately 200,000
   Cambodians living in the United States, making up about 2% percent of
   the Asian population.

Polish[edit]

   The Polish language is very common in the Chicago metropolitan area.
   Chicago's largest white ethnic groups are those of Polish descent. The
   Polish people and the Polish language in Chicago have been very
   prevalent in the early years of the city, as well as the progression
   and economical and social development of Chicago. Poles in Chicagoland
   make up one of the largest ethnically Polish population (650,000
   people) in the world comparable to the city of Wrocław, the fourth
   largest city in Poland. That makes it one of the most important centres
   of Polonia and the Polish language in the United States, a fact that
   the city celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of Polonia
   Festival in Jefferson Park.^[55]

Portuguese[edit]

   The first Portuguese speakers in America were Jews who had fled the
   Inquisition; they founded the first Jewish communities, two of which
   stiil exist: Congregation Shearith Israel in New York and Congregation
   Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. However, by the end of the 18th century
   the use of Portuguese had been replaced by English. In the late 19th
   century, many Portuguese, mainly Azoreans and Madeirans, immigrated to
   the United States, establishing in cities like Providence, Rhode
   Island, New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Santa Cruz, California. Many of
   them also moved to Hawaii during its independence.

   In the mid-late 20th century there was another surge of Portuguese
   immigration in America, mainly in the Northeast (New Jersey, New York,
   Connecticut, Massachusetts). Many Portuguese Americans may include
   descendants of Portuguese settlers born in Africa (like Angola, Cape
   Verde, and Mozambique) and Asia (mostly Macau). There were around 1
   million Portuguese Americans in the United States by the year 2000.
   Portuguese (European Portuguese) has been spoken in the United States
   by small communities of immigrants, mainly in the metropolitan New York
   City area, like Newark, New Jersey. The Portuguese language is also
   spoken widely by Brazilian immigrants, established mainly in Miami, New
   York City and Boston. (Brazilian Portuguese)

Scottish Gaelic[edit]

   In the 17th and 18th centuries, tens of thousands of Scots from
   Scotland, and Scots-Irish from the north of Ireland arrived in the
   American colonies. Today, an estimated 20 million Americans are of
   Scottish ancestry. The province of Nova Scotia, Canada was the main
   concentration of Scottish Gaelic speakers in North America (Nova Scotia
   is Latin for New Scotland). According to the 2007 American Community
   Survey, 1,445 people speak Scottish Gaelic at home.

Swedish[edit]

   Swedish language distribution in the United States.

   There has been a Swedish presence in America since the New Sweden
   colony came into existence in March 1638.

   Widespread diaspora of Swedish immigration did not occur until the
   latter half of the 19th century, bringing in a total of a million
   Swedes. No other country had a higher percentage of its people leave
   for the United States except Ireland and Norway. At the beginning of
   the 20th century, Minnesota had the highest ethnic Swedish population
   in the world after the city of Stockholm.

   3.7% of US residents claim descent from Scandinavian ancestors,
   amounting to roughly 11–12 million people. According to SIL's
   Ethnologue, over half a million ethnic Swedes still speak the language,
   though according to the 2007 American Community Survey only 56,715
   speak it at home. Cultural assimilation has contributed to the gradual
   and steady decline of the language in the US. After the independence of
   the US from the Kingdom of Great Britain, the government encouraged
   colonists to adopt the English language as a common medium of
   communication, and in some cases, imposed it upon them. Subsequent
   generations of Swedish Americans received education in English and
   spoke it as their first language. Lutheran churches scattered across
   the Midwest started abandoning Swedish in favor of English as their
   language of worship. Swedish newspapers and publications alike slowly
   faded away.

   There are sizable Swedish communities in Minnesota, Ohio, Maryland,
   Philadelphia and Delaware, along with small isolated pockets in
   Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. Chicago
   once contained a large Swedish enclave called Andersonville on the
   city's north side.

   John Morton, the person who cast the decisive vote leading to
   Pennsylvania's support for the United States Declaration of
   Independence, was of Finnish descent. Finland was part of the Kingdom
   of Sweden in the 18th century.

Welsh[edit]

   Welsh language distribution in the United States.

   Up to two million Americans are thought to have Welsh ancestry.
   However, there is very little Welsh being used commonly in the USA.
   According to the 2007 American Comminty Survey, 2,285 people speak
   Welsh at home; primarily spoken in California (415), Florida (225), New
   York (204), Ohio (135), and New Jersey (130).^[56] Some place names,
   such as Bryn Mawr in Chicago and Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (English: Big
   Hill) are Welsh. Several towns in Pennsylvania, mostly in the Welsh
   Tract, have Welsh namesakes, including Uwchlan, Bala Cynwyd, Gwynedd,
   and Tredyffrin.

Yiddish[edit]

   Yiddish has a much longer history in the United States than
   Hebrew.^[57] It has been present since at least the late 19th century
   and continues to have roughly 148,000 speakers as of the 2009 American
   Community Survey. Though they came from varying geographic backgrounds
   and nuanced approaches to worship, immigrant Jews of Eastern Europe and
   Russia were often united under a common understanding of the Yiddish
   language once they settled in America, and at one point dozens of
   publications were available in most East Coast cities. Though it has
   declined by quite a bit since the end of WWII, it has by no means
   disappeared. Many Israeli immigrants and expatriates have at least some
   understanding of the language in addition to Hebrew, and many of the
   descendants of the great migration of Ashkenazi Jews of the past
   century pepper their mostly English vocabulary with some loan words.
   Furthermore, it is definitely a lingua franca alive and well among
   Orthodox Jewry, particularly in Los Angeles, Miami and New
   York.^[58]^[59]

New American languages, dialects, and creoles[edit]

   Several languages have developed on American soil, including creoles
   and sign languages.

African American Vernacular English[edit]

   African American Vernacular English (AAVE), also known as Ebonics, is a
   variety of English spoken by many African Americans, in both rural and
   urban areas. Not all African Americans speak AAVE and many European
   Americans do. Indeed, it is generally accepted that Southern American
   English is part of the same continuum as AAVE.

   There is considerable debate among non-linguists as to whether the word
   "dialect" is appropriate to describe it. However, there is general
   agreement among linguists and many African Americans that AAVE is part
   of a historical continuum between creoles such as Gullah and the
   language brought by English colonists.

   Some educators view AAVE as exerting a negative influence on the
   learning of Proper and Standard English, as numerous AAVE rules differ
   from the rules of Standard English. Other educators, however, propose
   that Standard English should be taught as a "second dialect" in areas
   where AAVE is a strong part of local tradition.

Chinuk Wawa or Chinook Jargon[edit]

   Chinuk Wawa (or Chinook Jargon) is a Creole language of 700–800 words
   of French, English, Cree and other Native origins. It is the old trade
   language of the Pacific Northwest. It was used extensively among both
   European and Native peoples of the old Oregon Territory, even used in
   place of English at home for many families. It is estimated that around
   250,000 people spoke it at its peak and it was last used extensively in
   Seattle.

Gullah[edit]

   Gullah, an English-African creole language spoken on the Sea Islands of
   South Carolina and Georgia, retains strong influences of West African
   languages. The language is sometimes referred to as "Geechee".

Hawai'i Creole English[edit]

   Hawaiian Pidgin, more accurately known as Hawai'i Creole English, is
   commonly used by locals and is considered an unofficial language of the
   state. This not to be confused with Hawaiian English which is standard
   American English with Hawaiian words.

Louisiana Creole French[edit]

   Louisiana Creole French is a French Creole language spoken by the
   Louisiana Creole people of the state of Louisiana, close to Haitian
   Creole, Colonial French and Cajun French (language of Acadians
   deportated from New France after 1755 and the Grand Dérangement).
   French Creole is spoken by millions of people worldwide, mainly in the
   United States and Indian Ocean areas.

Outer Banks languages[edit]

   In the islands of the Outer Banks off North Carolina, several unique
   English dialects have developed. This is evident on Harkers Island and
   Ocracoke Island. These dialects are sometimes referred to as "high
   tider".

Pennsylvania German[edit]

   Pennsylvania German is a language that traditionally was spoken mainly
   in Pennsylvania, but that since the 19th century has spread to the
   Midwest (Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states), where the majority of
   speakers live today. It evolved from the German dialect of the
   Palatinate brought over to America by the Pennsylvania Dutch people
   before 1800. Originally spoken by adherents of different Christian
   denominations (Lutherans, Mennonites, Amish, German Baptists,
   Catholics) today it is mainly spoken by Amish and Old Order Mennonites.

Texas Silesian[edit]

   Texas Silesian (Silesian: teksasko gwara) is a language used by Texas
   Silesians in American settlements from 1852 to the present.

Tangier Islander[edit]

   Another dialectal isolate is that spoken on Tangier Island, Virginia
   located in the Chesapeake bay. The dialect is partially derived from
   English as spoken by English pre-Revolutionary settlers, and partially
   from the present-day Middle-Atlantic American dialect of English. It
   also contains some words from the Cornish Language, the Celtic language
   spoken in Cornwall in southwest England.^[citation needed]

Chicano English[edit]

   A mixture of the Spanish and American English languages spoken by many
   Hispanics in urban areas and predominantly Latino communities. See also
   Chicano English and New Mexican Spanish for Mexican-American dialects
   of the Southwest.

Sign languages[edit]

   See also: Native American sign languages
   [icon] This section requires expansion. (January 2007)

American Sign Language[edit]

   American Sign Language (ASL) is the native language of a number of Deaf
   and hearing people in America. While some sources have stated that ASL
   is the second most frequently used non-English language in the US,
   following Spanish,^[60] recent scholarship has pointed out that most of
   these estimates are based on numbers conflating deafness with ASL use,
   and that the last actual study of this (in 1972) seems to indicate an
   upper bound of 500,000 ASL speakers at the time.^[18]

   Unlike Signed English, ASL is a natural language in its own right, not
   a manual representation of English.^[61]

Black American Sign Language[edit]

   Black American Sign Language (BASL) developed in the southeastern US,
   where separate residential schools were maintained for white and black
   deaf children. BASL shares much of the same vocabulary and grammatical
   structure as ASL and is generally considered one of its
   dialects.^[60]^[61]^[62]

Hawaii Pidgin Sign Language[edit]

   Hawaii Pidgin Sign Language is moribund. (It is named after Hawaii
   Pidgin English, but is not itself a pidgin nor related to Hawaii
   Pidgin. Recent work by linguists uses the name "Hawaii Sign
   Language".^[63])

Martha's Vineyard Sign Language[edit]

   Martha's Vineyard Sign Language is now extinct. Along with French Sign
   Language, it was one of two main contributors to American Sign
   Language.

   33. ^ Some^[who?] have asserted that the New Mexico situation is part
       of the provisions in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; however,
       no mention of "language rights" is made in the Treaty or in the
       Protocol of Querétaro, beyond the "Mexican inhabitants" having (1)
       no reduction of rights below those of citizens of the United States
       and (2) precisely the same rights as are mentioned in Article III
       of the Treaty of the Louisiana Purchase and in the Treaty of the
       Florida Purchase. This would imply^[original research?] that the
       legal status of the Spanish language in New Mexico and in
       non-Gadsden Purchase areas of Arizona is the same as of French in
       Louisiana and certainly not less than that of German in
       Pennsylvania.
