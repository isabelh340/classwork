   Midterm elections in the United States refer to general elections in
   the United States that are held two years after the quadrennial
   (four-year) elections for the President of the United States (i.e. near
   the midpoint of the four-year presidential term). Federal offices that
   are up for election during the midterms are members of the United
   States Congress, including all 435 seats in the United States House of
   Representatives, and the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in
   the United States Senate.

   In addition, 34 of the 50 U.S. states elect their governors to
   four-year terms during midterm elections, while Vermont and New
   Hampshire elect governors to two-year terms in both midterm and
   presidential elections. Thus, 36 governors are elected during midterm
   elections. Many states also elect officers to their state legislatures
   in midterm years. There are also elections held at the municipal level.
   On the ballot are many mayors, other local public offices, and a wide
   variety of citizen initiatives.

   Special elections are often held in conjunction with regular elections,
   so additional Senators, governors and other local officials may be
   elected to partial terms.

   Midterm elections usually generate lower voter turnout than
   presidential elections. Only about 40 percent of those eligible to vote
   actually go to the polls in midterm elections.^[1]

Historical record of midterm elections[edit]

   Midterm elections are sometimes regarded as a referendum on the sitting
   president's and/or incumbent party's performance.^[2]^[3] The party of
   the incumbent president tends to lose ground during midterm elections:
   over the past 21 midterm elections, the President's party has lost an
   average 30 seats in the House, and an average 4 seats in the Senate;
   moreover, in only two of those has the President's party gained seats
   in both houses.
