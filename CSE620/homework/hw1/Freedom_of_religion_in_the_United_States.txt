   In the United States, freedom of religion is a constitutionally
   guaranteed right provided in the religion clauses of the First
   Amendment. Freedom of religion is also closely associated with
   separation of church and state, a concept advocated by Colonial
   founders such as Roger Williams, William Penn and later founding
   fathers such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.^[1]

Legal and public foundation[edit]

   The United States Constitution addresses the issue of religion in two
   places: in the First Amendment, and the Article VI prohibition on
   religious tests as a condition for holding public office. The First
   Amendment prohibits the federal government from making a law
   "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
   exercise thereof". This provision was later expanded to state and local
   governments, through the Incorporation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Colonial precedents[edit]

   Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle in the founding of
   the colony of Maryland, also founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore, in
   1634.^[2] Fifteen years later (1649), the first enactment of religious
   liberty, the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore,
   provided: "No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies
   troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her
   religion nor in the free exercise thereof." The Maryland Toleration Act
   was repealed with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new
   law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was
   passed.^[3] In 1657, Lord Baltimore regained control after making a
   deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again
   passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than
   thirty years, until 1692,^[4] when after Maryland's Protestant
   Revolution of 1689, freedom of religion was again rescinded.^[2]^[5] In
   addition in 1704, an Act was passed "to prevent the growth of Popery in
   this Province", preventing Catholics from holding political office.^[5]
   Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the
   American Revolution, when Maryland's Charles Carroll of Carrollton
   signed the American Declaration of Independence.

   Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
   (1682), founded by Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas
   Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, combined religious
   freedom with the democratic form of government that Separatist
   Congregationalists (Pilgrim Fathers) and Puritans had developed in
   Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony
   (1628).^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10] These colonies became safe havens for
   persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and Jews also had full
   citizenship and free exercise of their faiths.^[11]^[12]^[13] Williams,
   Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that democracy
   and freedom of conscience were the will of God. Williams gave the most
   profound theological reason: As faith is the free gift of the Holy
   Spirit, it cannot be forced upon a person. Therefore strict separation
   of church and state has to be kept.^[14] Pennsylvania was the only
   colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation
   of the United States. The inseparable connection of democracy, freedom
   of religion, and the other forms of freedom became the political and
   legal basis of the new nation. In particular, Baptists and
   Presbyterians demanded vigorously and successfully the disestablishment
   of the Anglican and Congregational state churches that had existed in
   most colonies since the seventeenth century.^[15]

The First Amendment[edit]

   In the United States, the religious civil liberties are guaranteed by
   the First Amendment to the United States Constitution:

     Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
     or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
     of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
     assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
     grievances.

   The "Establishment Clause," stating that "Congress shall make no law
   respecting an establishment of religion," is generally read to prohibit
   the Federal government from establishing a national church ("religion")
   or excessively involving itself in religion, particularly to the
   benefit of one religion over another. Following the ratification of the
   Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and through the
   doctrine of incorporation, this restriction is held to be applicable to
   state governments as well.

   The "Free Exercise Clause" states that Congress cannot "prohibit the
   free exercise" of religious practices. The Supreme Court of the United
   States has consistently held, however, that the right to free exercise
   of religion is not absolute. For example, in the 19th century, some of
   the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
   traditionally practiced polygamy, yet in Reynolds v. United States
   (1879), the Supreme Court upheld the criminal conviction of one of
   these members under a federal law banning polygamy. The Court reasoned
   that to do otherwise would set precedent for a full range of religious
   beliefs including those as extreme as human sacrifice. The Court stated
   that "Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they
   cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with
   practices." For example, if one were part of a religion that believed
   in vampirism, the First Amendment would protect one's belief in
   vampirism, but not the practice.

The Fourteenth Amendment[edit]

   The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees
   the religious civil rights.^[16] Whereas the First Amendment secures
   the free exercise of religion, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment
   prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of religion, by
   securing "the equal protection of the laws" for every person:
   “ All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
     the jurisdiction there of, are citizens of the United States and of the
     State where in they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law
     which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
     United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty,
     or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within
     its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.                     ”

Religious tests[edit]

   The affirmation or denial of specific religious beliefs had, in the
   past, been made into qualifications for public office; however, the
   United States Constitution states that the inauguration of a President
   may include an "affirmation" of the faithful execution of his duties
   rather than an "oath" to that effect — this provision was included in
   order to respect the religious prerogatives of the Quakers, a
   Protestant Christian denomination that declines the swearing of oaths.
   The U.S. Constitution also provides that "No religious Test shall ever
   be required as a Qualification of any Office or public Trust under the
   United States." Several states have language included in their
   constitutions that requires state office-holders to have particular
   religious beliefs.^[17] These include Arkansas,^[18] Maryland,^[18]
   Massachusetts,^[19] North Carolina,^[19] Pennsylvania,^[19] South
   Carolina,^[19] Tennessee,^[19] and Texas.^[19]^[20] Some of these
   beliefs (or oaths) were historically required of jurors and witnesses
   in court. Even though they are still on the books, these provisions
   have been rendered unenforceable by U.S. Supreme Court decisions.^[17]

   With reference to the use of animals, the U.S. Supreme Court decision
   in the case of the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah in
   1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal
   sacrifice with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision,
   “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or
   comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection”.
   (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in Thomas
   v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division 450 U.S.
   707 (1981))^[21] Likewise in Texas in 2009, issues that related to
   animal sacrifice and animal rights were taken to the 5th U.S. Circuit
   Court of Appeals in the case of Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba
   Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless. The court ruled that the
   free exercise of religion was meritorious and prevailing and that
   Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration
   Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of Euless, Texas from
   enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating
   to the use of animals.^[22]

   Religious liberty has not prohibited states or the federal government
   from prohibiting or regulating certain behaviors; i.e. prostitution,
   gambling, alcohol and certain drugs, although some libertarians
   interpret religious freedom to extend to these behaviors. However, the
   United States Supreme Court has ruled that a right to privacy or a due
   process right does prevent the government from prohibiting adult access
   to birth control, pornography, and from outlawing sodomy between
   consenting adults and early trimester abortions.

The "wall of separation"[edit]

   Thomas Jefferson wrote that the First Amendment erected a "wall of
   separation between church and state" likely borrowing the language from
   Roger Williams, founder of the First Baptist Church in America and the
   Colony of Rhode Island, who used the phrase in his 1644 book, The
   Bloody Tenent of Persecution.^[23] James Madison, often regarded as the
   "Father of the Bill of Rights",^[24] also often wrote of the "perfect
   separation",^[25] "line of separation",^[26] "strongly guarded as is
   the separation between religion and government in the Constitution of
   the United States",^[27] and "total separation of the church from the
   state".^[28] Controversy rages in the United States between those who
   wish to restrict government involvement with religious institutions and
   remove religious references from government institutions and property,
   and those who wish to loosen such prohibitions. Advocates for stronger
   separation of church and state emphasize the plurality of faiths and
   non-faiths in the country, and what they see as broad guarantees of the
   federal Constitution. Their opponents emphasize what they see as the
   largely Christian heritage and history of the nation (often citing the
   references to "Nature's God" and the "Creator" of men in the
   Declaration of Independence). Some more socially conservative Christian
   sects, such as the Christian Reconstructionist movement, oppose the
   concept of a "wall of separation" and prefer a closer relationship
   between church and state.

   Problems also arise in U.S. public schools concerning the teaching and
   display of religious issues. In various counties, school choice and
   school vouchers have been put forward as solutions to accommodate
   variety in beliefs and freedom of religion, by allowing individual
   school boards to choose between a secular, religious or multi-faith
   vocation, and allowing parents free choice among these schools. Critics
   of American voucher programs claim that they take funds away from
   public schools, and that the amount of funds given by vouchers is not
   enough to help many middle and working class parents.

   U.S. judges often ordered alcoholic defendants to attend Alcoholics
   Anonymous or face imprisonment. However, in 1999, a federal appeals
   court ruled this unconstitutional because the A.A. program relies on
   submission to a "Higher Power".^[29]

   Thomas Jefferson also played a large role in the formation of freedom
   of religion. He created the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom,
   which has since been incorporated into the Virginia State Constitution.

Other statements[edit]

Unalienable rights[edit]

   The United States of America was established on foundational principles
   by the Declaration of Independence:^[30]

     We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created
     equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
     unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
     pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are
     instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
     the governed;

   (based on Thomas Jefferson's draft.)

Religious institutions[edit]

   In 1944, a joint committee of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ
   in America and the Foreign Missions Conference formulated a “Statement
   on Religious Liberty”

          “Religious Liberty shall be interpreted to include freedom to
          worship according to conscience and to bring up children in the
          faith of their parents; freedom for the individual to change his
          religion; freedom to preach, educate, publish and carry on
          missionary activities; and freedom to organize with others, and
          to acquire and hold property, for these purposes.”^[31]

Freedom of religion restoration[edit]

   Following increasing government involvement in religious matters,
   Congress passed the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.^[32] A
   number of states then passed corresponding acts (e.g., Missouri passed
   the Religious Freedom Restoration Act).^[33]

Treaty of Tripoli[edit]

   Signed on November 4, 1796, the Treaty of Tripoli was a document that
   included the following statement:

     As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any
     sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no
     character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of
     Mussulmen [Muslims]; and as the said States never entered into any
     war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation,
     it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious
     opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing
     between the two countries.

   This treaty was submitted to the Senate and was ratified unanimously on
   June 7, 1797, and then signed by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.
   In accordance with Article VI of the Constitution, on that date this
   treaty became incorporated as part of "the supreme Law of the Land".

Supreme Court rulings[edit]

Jehovah's Witnesses[edit]

   Since the 1940s, the Jehovah's Witnesses have often invoked the First
   Amendment's freedom of religion clauses to protect their ability to
   engage in the proselytizing (or preaching) that is central to their
   faith. This series of litigation has helped to define civil liberties
   case law in the United States and Canada.

   In the United States of America and several other countries, the legal
   struggles of the Jehovah's Witnesses have yielded some of the most
   important judicial decisions regarding freedom of religion, press and
   speech. In the United States, many Supreme Court cases involving
   Jehovah's Witnesses are now landmark decisions of First Amendment law.
   Of the 72 cases involving the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been
   brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court has ruled in favor of
   them 47 times. Even the cases that the Jehovah's Witnesses lost helped
   the U.S. to more clearly define the limits of First Amendment rights.
   Former Supreme Court Justice Harlan Stone jokingly suggested "The
   Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which
   they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties." "Like it
   or not," observed American author and editor Irving Dilliard,
   "Jehovah's Witnesses have done more to help preserve our freedoms than
   any other religious group."

   Professor C. S. Braden wrote: "They have performed a signal service to
   democracy by their fight to preserve their civil rights, for in their
   struggle they have done much to secure those rights for every minority
   group in America."^[34]

   "The cases that the Witnesses were involved in formed the bedrock of
   1st Amendment protections for all citizens," said Paul Polidoro, a
   lawyer who argued the Watchtower Society's case before the Supreme
   Court in February 2002. "These cases were a good vehicle for the courts
   to address the protections that were to be accorded free speech, the
   free press and free exercise of religion. In addition, the cases marked
   the emergence of individual rights as an issue within the U.S. court
   system.

   Before the Jehovah’s Witnesses brought several dozen cases before the
   U.S. Supreme Court during the 1930s and 1940s, the Court had handled
   few cases contesting laws that restricted freedom of speech and freedom
   of religion. Until then, the First Amendment had only been applied to
   Congress and the federal government.

   However, the cases brought before the Court by the Jehovah's Witnesses
   allowed the Court to consider a range of issues: mandatory flag salute,
   sedition, free speech, literature distribution and military draft law.
   These cases proved to be pivotal moments in the formation of
   constitutional law. Jehovah’s Witnesses’ court victories have
   strengthened rights including the protection of religious conduct from
   federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic
   rituals and military service and the right to engage in public
   discourse.

   During the World War II era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of
   Jehovah's Witnesses in several landmark cases that helped pave the way
   for the modern civil rights movement. In all, Jehovah's Witnesses
   brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme
   Court between 1938 and 1946.

Lemon test[edit]

   The Supreme Court has consistently held fast to the rule of strict
   separation of church and state when matters of prayer are involved. In
   Engel v. Vitale (1962) the Court ruled that government-imposed
   nondenominational prayer in public school was unconstitutional. In Lee
   v. Weisman (1992), the Court ruled prayer established by a school
   principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and
   in Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe (2000) it ruled that school
   officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school
   football games nor establish an official student election process for
   the purpose of indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction
   between force of government and individual liberty is the cornerstone
   of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to
   establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students'
   individual freedom to pray.

   The Court has therefore tried to determine a way to deal with
   church/state questions. In Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), the Court created
   a three-part test for laws dealing with religious establishment. This
   determined that a law was constitutional if it:
    1. Had a secular purpose
    2. Neither advanced nor inhibited religion
    3. Did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.

   Some examples of where inhibiting religion has been struck down:
     * In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the Court ruled that a
       Missouri law prohibiting religious groups from using state
       university grounds and buildings for religious worship was
       unconstitutional. As a result, Congress decided in 1984 that this
       should apply to secondary and primary schools as well, passing the
       Equal Access Act, which prevents public schools from discriminating
       against students based on "religious, political, philosophical or
       other content of the speech at such meetings". In Board of
       Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226,
       236 (1990), the Court upheld this law when it ruled that a school
       board's refusal to allow a Christian Bible club to meet in a public
       high school classroom violated the act.
     * In Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98 (2001),
       the Court ruled that religious groups must be allowed to use public
       schools after hours if the same access is granted to other
       community groups.
     * In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of
       Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), the Supreme Court found that the
       University of Virginia was unconstitutionally withholding funds
       from a religious student magazine.

State constitutions[edit]

   A Christian flag displayed alongside the flag of the USA next to the
   pulpit in a church in California. Note the eagle and cross finials on
   the flag poles.

   Under the doctrine of Incorporation, the first amendment has been made
   applicable to the states. Therefore the states must guarantee the
   freedom of religion in the same way the federal government must.

   Many states have freedom of religion established in their constitution,
   though the exact legal consequences of this right vary for historical
   and cultural reasons. Most states interpret "freedom of religion" as
   including the freedom of long-established religious communities to
   remain intact and not be destroyed. By extension, democracies interpret
   "freedom of religion" as the right of each individual to freely choose
   to convert from one religion to another, mix religions, or abandon
   religion altogether.

In office and at work[edit]

Requirements for holding a public office[edit]

   Main article: Oath of Office § United States

   The no religious test clause of the U.S. constitution states that "no
   religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office
   or public trust under the United States." Although it has become
   tradition for US presidents to end their Presidential Oath with "so
   help me God", this is not required by the Constitution. The same
   applies to the Vice President, the House of Representatives, the
   Senate, the members of the Cabinet, and all other civil and military
   officers and federal employees, who can either make an affirmation or
   take an oath ending with "so help me God."^[35]
   See also: Oath of office of the President of the United States, United
   States Uniformed Services Oath of Office and Oath of enlistment

   Some state constitutions in the US require belief in God or a Supreme
   Being as a prerequisite for holding public office or being a witness in
   court. This applies to Arkansas,^[36] Maryland,^[37] Mississippi,^[38]
   North Carolina,^[39] where the requirement was challenged and
   overturned in Voswinkel v. Hunt (1979),^[citation needed] South
   Carolina,^[40] Tennessee,^[41] and Texas,^[42] debatably.^[43] A
   unanimous 1961 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Torcaso v. Watkins held
   that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution
   override these state requirements,^[44] so they are not enforced.

Issues at the workplace[edit]

   Problems sometimes arise in the workplace concerning religious
   observance when a private employer discharges an employee for failure
   to report to work on what the employee considers a holy day or a day of
   rest. In the United States, the view that has generally prevailed is
   that firing for any cause in general renders a former employee
   ineligible for unemployment compensation, but that this is no longer
   the case if the 'cause' is religious in nature, especially an
   employee's unwillingness to work during Jewish Shabbat, Christian
   Sabbath, or Muslim jumu'ah.

   After reports in August 2010^[update] that soldiers who refused to
   attend a Christian band's concert at a Virginia military base were
   essentially punished by being banished to their barracks and told to
   clean them up, an Army spokesman said that an investigation was
   underway and "If something like that were to have happened, it would be
   contrary to Army policy."^[45]^[46]

Situation of minority groups[edit]

Situation of Catholics[edit]

   Main article: Anti-Catholicism in the United States
   Famous 1876 editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast showing bishops as
   crocodiles attacking public schools, with the connivance of Irish
   Catholic politicians

   John Highham described anti-Catholicism as "the most luxuriant,
   tenacious tradition of paranoiac agitation in American history".^[47]
   Anti-Catholicism which was prominent in the United Kingdom was exported
   to the United States. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in
   colonial society. The first, derived from the heritage of the
   Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the 16th century,
   consisted of the "Anti-Christ" and the "Whore of Babylon" variety and
   dominated Anti-Catholic thought until the late 17th century. The second
   was a more secular variety which focused on the supposed intrigue of
   the Catholics intent on extending medieval despotism worldwide.^[48]

   Historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. has called Anti-Catholicism "the
   deepest-held bias in the history of the American people."^[49]

   Bishop Alma White Published by the Pillar of Fire Church in Zarephath,

   Because many of the British colonists, such as the Puritans and
   Congregationalists, were fleeing religious persecution by the Church of
   England, much of early American religious culture exhibited the more
   extreme anti-Catholic bias of these Protestant denominations. Monsignor
   John Tracy Ellis wrote that a "universal anti-Catholic bias was brought
   to Jamestown in 1607 and vigorously cultivated in all the thirteen
   colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia."^[50] Colonial charters and
   laws contained specific proscriptions against Roman Catholics.
   Monsignor Ellis noted that a common hatred of the Roman Catholic Church
   could unite Anglican clerics and Puritan ministers despite their
   differences and conflicts.

   Some of America's Founding Fathers held anti-clerical beliefs. For
   example, in 1788, John Jay urged the New York Legislature to require
   office-holders to renounce foreign authorities "in all matters
   ecclesiastical as well as civil.".^[51] Thomas Jefferson wrote:
   "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people
   maintaining a free civil government,"^[52] and, "In every country and
   in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in
   alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection
   to his own."^[53]

   Some states devised loyalty oaths designed to exclude Catholics from
   state and local office.^[54] The public support for American
   independence and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by
   prominent American Catholics like Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the
   only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his second
   cousins, Bishop John Carroll and Daniel Carroll, allowed Roman
   Catholics to be included in the constitutional protections of civil and
   religious liberty.^[55]

   Anti-Catholic animus in the United States reached a peak in the 19th
   century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the influx of
   Catholic immigrants. Some American Protestants, having an increased
   interest in prophecies regarding the end of time, claimed that the
   Catholic Church was the Whore of Babylon in the Book of
   Revelation.^[56] The resulting "nativist" movement, which achieved
   prominence in the 1840s, was whipped into a frenzy of anti-Catholicism
   that led to mob violence, the burning of Catholic property, and the
   killing of Catholics.^[57] This violence was fed by claims that
   Catholics were destroying the culture of the United States. The
   nativist movement found expression in a national political movement
   called the Know-Nothing Party of the 1850s, which (unsuccessfully) ran
   former president Millard Fillmore as its presidential candidate in
   1856.

   The founder of the Know-Nothing movement, Lewis C. Levin, based his
   political career entirely on anti-Catholicism, and served three terms
   in the U.S. House of Representatives (1845–1851), after which he
   campaigned for Fillmore and other "nativist" candidates.

   After 1875 many states passed constitutional provisions, called "Blaine
   Amendments, forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial
   schools.^[58]^[59] In 2002, the United States Supreme Court partially
   vitiated these amendments, when they ruled that vouchers were
   constitutional if tax dollars followed a child to a school, even if it
   were religious.^[60]

   Anti-Catholicism was widespread in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including
   the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with
   democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept
   Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to
   such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American
   citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics),
   were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of
   religion.^[61]

   The 1928 presidential campaign of Al Smith was a rallying point for the
   Klan and the tide of anti-Catholicism in the U.S. The Catholic Church
   of the Little Flower was first built in 1925 in Royal Oak, Michigan, a
   largely Protestant area. Two weeks after it opened, the Ku Klux Klan
   burned a cross in front of the church.^[62] The church burned down in a
   fire in 1936.^[63] In response, the church built a fireproof
   crucifixion tower, as a "cross they could not burn".^[64]

   In 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an initiative amending Oregon Law
   Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act. The law unofficially became
   known as the Oregon School Law. The citizens' initiative was primarily
   aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic
   schools.^[65] The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and
   nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In
   Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), the United States Supreme Court
   declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a
   ruling that that has been called "the Magna Carta of the parochial
   school system."

   In 1928, Al Smith became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major
   party's nomination for President, and his religion became an issue
   during the campaign. Many Protestants feared that Smith would take
   orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the
   country.

   A key factor that hurt John F. Kennedy in his 1960 campaign for the
   presidency of the United States was the widespread prejudice against
   his Roman Catholic religion; some Protestants, including Norman Vincent
   Peale, believed that, if he were elected President, Kennedy would have
   to take orders from the Pope in Rome.^[66] To address fears that his
   Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, John F. Kennedy
   famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September
   12, 1960, "I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the
   Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a
   Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters — and the
   Church does not speak for me."^[67] He promised to respect the
   separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to
   dictate public policy to him. Kennedy also raised the question of
   whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class
   citizenship just because they were Catholic.

   Kennedy went on to win the national popular vote over Richard Nixon by
   just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) – the closest
   popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the electoral college,
   Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's
   219 (269 were needed to win). The New York Times, summarizing the
   discussion late in November, spoke of a “narrow consensus” among the
   experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his
   Catholicism,^[68] as Catholics flocked to Kennedy to demonstrate their
   group solidarity in demanding political equality.

   In 2011, The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops argued that
   the Obama Administration put an undue burden upon Catholics and forced
   them to violate their right to freedom of religion as part of the
   Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Situations of the Latter Day Saint movement 1820–90[edit]

   Main article: Anti-Mormonism

   Historically, the Latter Day Saint movement, which is often called
   Mormonism, has been the victim of religious violence beginning with
   reports by founder Joseph Smith immediately after his First Vision
   1820^[69] and continuing as the movement grew and migrated from its
   inception in western New York to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. The
   violence culminated when Smith was assassinated by a mob of 200 men in
   Carthage Jail in 1844. Joseph Smith had surrendered himself previously
   to the authorities, who failed to protect him. As a result of the
   violence they were faced with in the East, the Mormon pioneers, led by
   Brigham Young, migrated westwards and eventually founded Salt Lake
   City, and many other communities along the Mormon Corridor.

   Smith and his followers experienced relatively low levels of
   persecution in New York and Ohio,^[70]^[clarification needed] although
   one incident involved church members being tarred and feathered.^[71]
   They would eventually move on to Missouri, where some of the worst
   atrocities against Mormons would take place. Smith declared the area
   around Independence, Missouri to be the site of Zion, inspiring a
   massive influx of Mormon converts. Locals, alarmed by rumors of the
   strange, new religion (including rumors of polygamy),^[citation needed]
   attempted to drive the Mormons out. This resulted in the 1838 Mormon
   War, the Haun's Mill massacre, and the issue of the Missouri Executive
   Order 44 by Governor Lilburn Boggs, which ordered "... Mormons must be
   treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state
   ...".^[72] The majority of Mormons would flee to Illinois, where they
   were received warmly by the village of Commerce, Illinois. The Mormons
   quickly expanded the town and renamed it Nauvoo, which was one of the
   largest cities in Illinois at the time.^[73] The economic, political,
   and religious dominance of the Mormons (Smith was mayor of the city and
   commander of the local militia, the Nauvoo Legion) inspired mobs to
   attack the city, and Smith was arrested for ordering the destruction of
   an anti-Mormon newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor, although he acted with
   the consent of the city council.^[74] He was imprisoned, along with his
   brother Hyrum Smith, at Carthage Jail, where they were attacked by a
   mob and murdered.

   After a succession crisis, most of the Mormons united under Brigham
   Young, who organized an evacuation from Nauvoo and from the United
   States itself after the federal government refused to protect the
   Mormons.^[75] Young and an eventual 50,000–70,000 would cross the Great
   Plains to settle in the Salt Lake Valley and the surrounding area.
   After the events of the Mexican-American War, the area became a United
   States territory. Young immediately petitioned for the addition of the
   State of Deseret, but the federal government declined. Instead,
   Congress carved out the much smaller Utah Territory. Over the next 46
   years, several actions of the federal government were directed at
   Mormons, specifically to curtail the practice of polygamy and to reduce
   their political and economic power. These included the Utah War,
   Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, Poland Act, Edmunds Act, and Edmunds-Tucker
   Act. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued the
   Manifesto, ending polygamy.

   With the concept of plural marriage, from 1830 to 1890 the Mormon faith
   allowed its members to practice polygamy; after 1843 this was limited
   to polygyny (one man could have several wives). The notion of polygamy
   was not only generally disdained by most of Joseph Smith's
   contemporaries,^[76] it is also contrary to the traditional Christian
   understanding of marriage. After 1844 the United States government
   passed legislation aimed specifically at the Mormon practice of
   polygamy until The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS
   Church) officially renounced it. In the case of Reynolds v. United
   States, the U.S. supreme court concluded that "religious duty" was not
   a suitable defense to an indictment for polygamy; therefore, a law
   against polygamy is not legally considered to discriminate against a
   religion that endorses polygamy. When their appeals to the courts and
   lawmakers were exhausted and once church leaders were satisfied that
   God had accepted what they saw as their sacrifice for the principle,
   the prophet leader of the church announced that he had received
   inspiration that God had accepted their obedience and rescinded the
   commandment for plural marriage. In 1890, an official declaration was
   issued by the church prohibiting further plural marriages.^[77] Utah
   was admitted to the Union on January 4, 1896.

Situation of Native Americans[edit]

   The situation of Native Americans in the United States has been
   problematic since the initial European colonization of the Americas.
   Aside from the general issues in the relations between Europeans and
   Native Americans, there has been a historic suppression of Native
   American religions as well as some current charges of religious
   discrimination against Native Americans by the U.S. government, that
   need to be considered.

   With the practice of the Americanization of Native Americans, Native
   American children were sent to Christian boarding schools where they
   were forced to worship as Christians and traditional customs were
   banned.^[78] Until the Freedom of Religion Act 1978, "spiritual leaders
   [of Native Americans] ran the risk of jail sentences of up to 30 years
   for simply practicing their rituals."^[79] The traditional indigenous
   Sun Dance was illegal from the 1880s (Canada) or 1904 (USA) to the
   1980s.

   Continuing charges of religious discrimination have largely centered on
   the eagle feather law, the use of ceremonial peyote, and the
   repatriation of Native American human remains and cultural and
   religious objects:
     * The eagle feather law, which governs the possession and religious
       use of eagle feathers, was written with the intention to protect
       then dwindling eagle populations on one hand while still protecting
       traditional Native American spiritual and religious customs, to
       which the use of eagle feather is central, on the other hand. As a
       result, the possession of eagle feathers is restricted to ethnic
       Native Americans, a policy that is seen as controversial for
       several reasons.

     * Peyote, a spineless cactus found in the desert southwest and
       Mexico, is commonly used in certain traditions of Native American
       religion and spirituality, most notably in the Native American
       Church. Prior to the passage of the American Indian Religious
       Freedom Act (AIRFA) in 1978, and as amended in 1994, the religious
       use of peyote was not afforded legal protection. This resulted in
       the arrest of many Native Americans and non-Native Americans
       participating in traditional indigenous religion and spirituality.

     * Native Americans often hold strong personal and spiritual
       connections to their ancestors and often believe that their remains
       should rest undisturbed. This has often placed Native Americans at
       odds with archaeologists who have often dug on Native American
       burial grounds and other sites considered sacred, often removing
       artifacts and human remains – an act considered sacrilegious by
       many Native Americans. For years, Native American communities
       decried the removal of ancestral human remains and cultural and
       religious objects, charging that such activities are acts of
       genocide, religious persecution, and discrimination. Many Native
       Americans called on the government, museums, and private collectors
       for the return of remains and sensitive objects for reburial. The
       Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA),
       which gained passage in 1990, established a means for Native
       Americans to request the return or "repatriation" of human remains
       and other sensitive cultural, religious, and funerary items held by
       federal agencies and federally assisted museums and institutions.

Situation of atheists[edit]

   Further information: Discrimination against atheists in the United
   States

   A 2006 study at the University of Minnesota showed atheists to be the
   most distrusted minority among Americans. In the study, sociologists
   Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann conducted a survey of
   American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups. 40% of
   respondents characterized atheists as a group that "does not at all
   agree with my vision of American society", putting atheists well ahead
   of every other group, with the next highest being Muslims (26%) and
   homosexuals (23%). When participants were asked whether they agreed
   with the statement, "I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a
   member of this group," atheists again led minorities, with 48%
   disapproval, followed by Muslims (34%) and African-Americans
   (27%).^[80]^[81] Joe Foley, co-chairman for Campus Atheists and Secular
   Humanists, commented on the results, "I know atheists aren't studied
   that much as a sociological group, but I guess atheists are one of the
   last groups remaining that it's still socially acceptable to
   hate."^[82]

   Several private organizations, the most notable being the Boy Scouts of
   America, do not allow atheist members.^[83] However, this policy has
   come under fire by organizations who assert that the Boy Scouts of
   America do benefit from taxpayer money and thus cannot be called a
   truly private organization, and thus must admit atheists, and others
   currently barred from membership. An organization called Scouting for
   All, founded by Eagle Scout Steven Cozza, is at the forefront of the
   movement.

Court cases[edit]

   In the 1994 case^[84] Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School
   District v. Grumet, Supreme Court Justice David Souter wrote in the
   opinion for the Court that: "government should not prefer one religion
   to another, or religion to irreligion".^[85] Everson v. Board of
   Education established that "neither a state nor the Federal Government
   can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one
   religion over another". This applies the Establishment Clause to the
   states as well as the federal government.^[86] However, several state
   constitutions make the protection of persons from religious
   discrimination conditional on their acknowledgment of the existence of
   a deity, making freedom of religion in those states inapplicable to
   atheists.^[17]^[18]^[19] These state constitutional clauses have not
   been tested. Civil rights cases are typically brought in federal
   courts, so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance.

   In Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, after atheist Michael
   Newdow challenged the phrase "under God" in the United States Pledge of
   Allegiance, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the phrase
   unconstitutional. Although the decision was stayed pending the outcome
   of an appeal, there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be
   legally usable without modification in schools in the western United
   States, over which the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction. This resulted in
   political furor, and both houses of Congress passed resolutions
   condemning the decision, unanimously.^[87] On June 26, a
   Republican-dominated group of 100–150 congressmen stood outside the
   capital and recited the pledge, showing how much they disagreed with
   the decision.^[87] The Supreme Court subsequently reversed the
   decision, ruling that Newdow did not have standing to bring his case,
   thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of
   the pledge.

Case studies[edit]

     * The Eagle Feather Law, which governs the possession and religious
       use of eagle feathers, was officially written to protect then
       dwindling eagle populations while still protecting traditional
       Native American spiritual and religious customs, of which the use
       of eagles are central. The Eagle Feather Law later met charges of
       promoting racial and religious discrimination due to the law’s
       provision authorizing the possession of eagle feathers to members
       of only one ethnic group, Native Americans, and forbidding Native
       Americans from including non-Native Americans in indigenous customs
       involving eagle feathers—a common modern practice dating back to
       the early 16th century.

     * Charges of religious and racial discrimination have also been found
       in the education system. In a recent example, the dormitory
       policies at Boston University and The University of South Dakota
       were charged with racial and religious discrimination when they
       forbade a university dormitory resident from smudging while
       praying. The policy at The University of South Dakota was later
       changed to permit students to pray while living in the university
       dorms.

     * The Seventh-day Adventist Church make it clear in their university
       catalog that they discriminate on the basis of religion.^[citation
       needed] They discriminate against non-Adventists in hiring
       practices, disciplinary action, and promotions.^[citation needed]
       The Seventh-day Adventist Church has made many anti-Catholic
       statements that the Bible identifies the Pope as the
       Anti-Christ.^[citation needed] As of 2012^[update], the church has
       softened these statements, explaining that they interpret the
       biblical passages as referring to the papal institution and not to
       a specific person.^[citation needed] They have also taken measures
       against church members who have publicly attacked the pope,
       especially those who claim that it is in the name of the
       church.^[citation needed]
     * In 2004, a case involving five Ohio prison inmates (two followers
       of Asatru, a minister of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, a
       Wiccan witch and a Satanist) protesting denial of access to
       ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship was brought
       before the Supreme Court.^[88] The Boston Globe reports on the 2005
       decision of Cutter v. Wilkinson^[89] in favour of the claimants as
       a notable case. Among the denied objects was instructions for runic
       writing requested by an Asatruar.^[90] Inmates of the "Intensive
       Management Unit" at Washington State Penitentiary who are adherents
       of Asatru in 2001 were deprived of their Thor's Hammer
       medallions.^[91] In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Asatru
       adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor’s Hammer
       pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections
       after he was denied it while members of other religions were
       allowed their medallions.^[92]

       speculated that one of John Johnson's sons, Eli, meant to punish
       Smith by having him castrated for an intimacy with his sister,
       Nancy Marinda Johnson. However, historian Richard Lyman Bushman
       states that this hypothesis failed, partly because Eli was John
       Johnson's brother, not his son. Bushman feels a more probable
       motivation is recorded by Symonds Ryder, a participant in the
       event, who felt Smith was plotting to take property from members of
       the community and a company of citizens violently warned Smith that
       they would not accept those actions.
