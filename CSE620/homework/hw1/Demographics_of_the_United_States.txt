   Largest ancestry groups by county, 2000.

   As of September 13, 2014, the United States has a total resident
   population of 318,730,000,^[1] making it the third-most populous
   country in the world.^[2] It is very urbanized, with 81% residing in
   cities and suburbs as of 2014 (the worldwide urban rate is 54%).^[3]
   California and Texas are the most populous states,^[4] as the mean
   center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and
   southward.^[5] New York City is the most populous city in the United
   States.^[6]

   The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2013 is
   1.87 children per woman,^[7] which is below the replacement fertility
   rate of approximately 2.1. Compared to other Western countries, in
   2012, U.S. fertility rate was lower than that of France (2.01),^[8]
   Australia (1.93) and the United Kingdom (1.92).^[9] However, U.S.
   population growth is among the highest in industrialized
   countries,^[10] because the differences in fertility rates are less
   than the differences in immigration levels, which are higher in the
   U.S.^[11]^[12] The United States Census Bureau shows population
   increase of 0.75% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2012.
   Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the
   world average annual rate of 1.1%.^[10]

   There were over 158.6 million females in the United States in 2009. The
   number of males was 151.4 million. At age 85 and older, there were more
   than twice as many women as men. People under 20 years of age made up
   over a quarter of the U.S. population (27.3%), and people age 65 and
   over made up one-eighth (12.8%) in 2009.^[13] The national median age
   was 36.8 years.^[13]

   The United States Census Bureau defines White people as those "having
   origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or
   North Africa. It includes people who reported "White" or wrote in
   entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab,
   or Polish."^[14] Whites constitute the majority of the U.S. population,
   with a total of 223,553,265 or 72.4% of the population in the 2010
   United States Census. There are 63.7% Whites when Hispanics who
   describe themselves as "white" are taken out of the calculation.
   Despite major changes due to illegal and legal immigration since the
   1960s and the higher birth-rates of nonwhites, the overall current
   majority of American citizens are still white, and English-speaking,
   though regional differences exist.

   The American population almost quadrupled during the 20th century—at a
   growth rate of about 1.3% a year—from about 76 million in 1900 to 281
   million in 2000. It reached the 200 million mark in 1968, and the 300
   million mark on October 17, 2006.^[15]^[16] Population growth is
   fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census
   Bureau's estimation for 2012, 50.4% of American children under the age
   of 1 belonged to minority groups.^[17]

   Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 48% of the national
   population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1,
   2006.^[18] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to
   provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.^[19]

   The Census Bureau projects a U.S. population of 439 million in 2050,
   which is a 46% increase from 2007 (301.3 million).^[20] However, the
   United Nations projects a U.S. population of 402 million in 2050, an
   increase of 32% from 2007 .^[21] In either case, such growth is unlike
   most European countries, especially Germany, and Greece, or Asian
   countries such as Japan or South Korea, whose populations are slowly
   declining, and whose fertility rates are below replacement. Official
   census report, reported that 54.4% (2,150,926 out of 3,953,593) of
   births in 2010, were non-Hispanic white. This represents an increase of
   0.34% compared to the previous year, which was 54.06%.^[22]

History[edit]

   Main article: Demographic history of the United States
   Manhattan's Little Italy, Lower East Side, circa 1900.

   In 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were 66.8
   million Whites in the United States, representing 88% of the total
   population,^[26] 8.8 million African Americans, with about 90% of them
   still living in Southern states,^[27] and slightly more than 500,000
   Hispanics.^[28]

   Under the law, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,^[29] the
   number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has
   increased,^[30] from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in
   2007.^[31] Around a million people legally immigrated to the United
   States per year in the 1990s, up from 250,000 per year in the
   1950s.^[32] In 2009, 37% of immigrants originated in Asia, 42% in North
   America, and 11% in Africa.^[33]

   In 1900, non-Hispanic whites comprised almost 97% of the population of
   the 10 largest American cities.^[34] By 2006, non-Hispanic whites had
   dwindled to a minority in 35 of the nation's 50 largest cities.^[35]
   The Census Bureau reported that minorities made up 50.4% of the
   children born in the U.S. between July 2010 and July 2011,^[36]
   compared to 37% in 1990.^[37]

   In 2010 the state with the lowest fertility rate was Rhode Island, with
   1,630.5 children per thousand women, while Utah had the greatest rate
   with 2,449.0 children per thousand women.^[38] This correlates with the
   ages of the states' populations: Rhode Island has the ninth-oldest
   median age in the US—39.2—while Utah has the youngest—29.0.^[39]

   The U.S. total fertility rate as of 2010 census is 1.931:
     * 1.948 for White Americans (including White Hispanics)
          + 1.791 for non-Hispanic Whites
     * 1.958 for Black Americans (including Black Hispanics)
          + 1.972 for non-Hispanic Blacks
     * 1.404 for Native Americans (including Hispanics)
     * 1.689 for Asian Americans (including Hispanics)

   Other:
     * 2.350 for Hispanics (of all racial groups)

   (Note that ~95% of Hispanics are included as "white Hispanics" by CDC,
   which does not recognize the Census' "Some other race" category and
   counts people in that category as white.)

   The most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,121/mi^2 or
   433/km^2). See List of U.S. states by population density for maps and
   complete statistics.

   The United States Census Bureau publishes a popular "dot" or

   metropolitan areas of the United States

   The United States has dozens of major cities, including 9 of the 66
   "global cities"^[46] of all types, with 10 in the "alpha" group of
   global cities: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, DC,
   Boston, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia.^[47]
   As of 2011^[update], the United States had 51 metropolitan areas with a
   population of over 1,000,000 people each. (See Table of United States
   Metropolitan Statistical Areas.)

   As of 2011^[update], about 250 million Americans live in or around
   urban areas. That means more than three-quarters of the U.S. population
   shares just about three percent of the U.S. land area.^[48]

   Each of the racial categories includes people who identify their
   ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino.^[52] U.S. federal law defines Hispanic
   or Latino as "those who classify themselves in one of the specific
   Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the Census 2000 or ACS
   questionnaire"—Mexican", "Puerto Rican", or "Cuban"—as well as those
   who indicate that they are "other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.""^[53]

   Persons whose ethnicity is identified as Hispanic or Latino may be of
   any race.

   The total population of Hispanic and Latino Americans comprised 50.5
   million or 16.3% of the national total in 2010.

Other groups[edit]

   There were 22.1 million veterans in 2009.^[55]

   In 2010, the Washington Post estimated that there were 11 million
   illegal immigrants in the country.^[56]

   There were about 2 million people in prison in 2010.^[57]

   The 2000 U.S. Census counted same-sex couples in an oblique way; asking
   the sex and the relationship to the "main householder", whose sex was
   also asked. One organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic
   data reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000
   supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 0.99% and
   1.13% of U.S. couples in 2000.^[58] A 2006 report issued by The
   Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of
   same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly
   600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005. 4.1% of Americans
   aged 18–45 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual^[59]

   A 2011 report by the Institute estimated that 4 million adults identify
   as gay or lesbian, representing 1.7% of the population over 18. A
   spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to
   eliminate people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or
   entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian
   or gay.^[60] (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and
   timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.)
   The American Community Survey from the 2000 U.S. Census estimated
   776,943 same-sex couple households in the country as a whole,
   representing about 0.5% of the population.^[59]

   Less than 1% of Americans serve in the Armed Forces.^[61]

   Non-Hispanics/Latinos (of any race) 82.2% 69.4%
   ^1 Including Hispanics and Some other race
   ^2 Including Hispanics

   A report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of
   Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.^[63] At the same
   time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority
   of the population by 2042, but will remain the largest single ethnic
   group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic
   whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.^[64]

   The report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16%
   today to 30% by 2050, the African American percentage barely rising
   from 12.9% to 13.0%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to
   7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in
   October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439
   million in 2050.^[20]^[65]^[66]^[67] It is further projected that 82%
   of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to
   immigrants and their children.^[68]

   Of the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority
   ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be
   Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be
   single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).^[69]

   In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau projected future censuses as

Religions of American adults[edit]

   Main article: Religion in the United States

   The United States government does not collect religious data in its
   census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey
   (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461
   American residential households in the contiguous United States. The
   1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.

   Adult respondents were asked the open-ended question, "What is your
   religion, if any?". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested
   list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was
   also asked. If the initial answer was "Protestant" or "Christian"
   further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination.
   About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic
   questions.

   Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect
   refusals are possibly more representative of "no religion" than any
   other group.

Social class[edit]

   Main article: Social class in the United States

   Social classes in the United States lack distinct boundaries and may
   overlap. Even their existence (when distinguished from economic strata)
   is controversial. The following table provides a summary of some
   prominent academic theories on the stratification of American society:

   CAPTION: Academic Class Models

   Dennis Gilbert, 2002 William Thompson & Joseph Hickey, 2005 Leonard
   Beeghley, 2004
   Class Typical characteristics Class Typical characteristics Class
   Typical characteristics
   Capitalist class (1%) Top-level executives, high-rung politicians,
   heirs. Ivy League education common. Upper class (1%) Top-level
   executives, celebrities, heirs; income of $500,000+ common. Ivy league
   education common. The super-rich (0.9%) Multi-millionaires whose
   incomes commonly exceed $350,000; includes celebrities and powerful
   executives/politicians. Ivy League education common.
   Upper middle class^[1] (15%) Highly-educated (often with graduate
   degrees), most commonly salaried, professionals and middle management
   with large work autonomy. Upper middle class^[1] (15%) Highly-educated
   (often with graduate degrees) professionals & managers with household
   incomes varying from the high 5-figure range to commonly above
   $100,000. The Rich (5%) Households with net worth of $1 million or
   more; largely in the form of home equity. Generally have college
   degrees.
   Middle class (plurality/
   majority?; ca. 46%) College-educated workers with considerably
   higher-than-average incomes and compensation; a man making $57,000 and
   a woman making $40,000 may be typical.
   Lower middle class (30%) Semi-professionals and craftsmen with a
   roughly average standard of living. Most have some college education
   and are white-collar. Lower middle class (32%) Semi-professionals and
   craftsmen with some work autonomy; household incomes commonly range
   from $35,000 to $75,000. Typically, some college education.
   Working class (30%) Clerical and most blue-collar workers whose work is
   highly routinized. Standard of living varies depending on number of
   income earners, but is commonly just adequate. High school education.
   Working class (32%) Clerical, pink- and blue-collar workers with often
   low job security; common household incomes range from $16,000 to
   $30,000. High school education. Working class
   (ca. 40–45%) Blue-collar workers and those whose jobs are highly
   routinized with low economic security; a man making $40,000 and a woman
   making $26,000 may be typical. High school education.

Health[edit]

   In 2010, the average man weighed 194.7 pounds (88.3 kg); the average
   woman 164.7 pounds (74.7 kg).^[76] The height of an American man was
   5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m)^[77] and woman 5 feet 3.8 inches
   (1.621 m)^[78] The average BMI is 27.3 for males (overweight) and 28.5
   for females (overweight).^[79]

   A study by William Strauss and Neil Howe, in their books Generations
   and Fourth Turning, looked at generational similarities and differences
   going back to the 15th century and concluded that over 80-year spans,
   generations proceed through four stages of about 20 years each.

   A definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by
   Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages
   was asked, "What world events are especially important to you?"^[85]
   They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the
   ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance
   rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident.

   Today the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts
   (alive in 2000–10):
     * G.I. Generation—born from approximately 1901 to 1924 (depression
       cohort who fought and won World War II).
          + Distinction: They represent the largest number of
            nonagenarians and centenarians alive in any time of US
            history.
          + Memorable events: The Great Depression, high levels of
            unemployment, poverty, lack of creature comforts, financial
            uncertainty, peak of European immigration (though started from
            1840 to end by 1920), grew up during World War I,
            prohibitionism, radical politics, not too religious but mostly
            morally conservative, shorter life spans, and stressed
            Americanization or acculturation into a common mainstream U.S.
            culture.
          + Key characteristics: strive for financial security, risk
            averse, waste-not-want-not attitude, strive for comfort,
            social cooperative, can be reactionary or hostile towards
            change, but are idealistic or progressive in improvements of
            quality of life.
     * Silent Generation—born from approximately 1925 to 1942^[86] during
       the Great Depression and World War II.^[87] The label was
       originally applied to people in North America but has also been
       applied to those in Western Europe, Australasia and South America.
       It includes most of those who fought during the Korean War.
          + Distinction: Second-smallest generation born in US
            history.^[citation needed] The birth rate peaked low due to
            the Depression.
          + Memorable events: sustained economic growth, social
            tranquility, The Cold War, McCarthyism, anti-communism, drug
            culture, conformity, the rise and peak of jazz music (1940s),
            early rock n' roll (1950s), fear of a nuclear war, and
            avoidance of discomfort with high emphasis on optimism.
          + Key characteristics: conformity, social conservatism,
            patriotism, comparatively chaste or emphasized traditional
            values (i.e. manners or taboos) than younger cohorts (who
            disagreed with them), traditional family values, but had the
            nuclear family replaced the multi-generational kind, known as
            the "Silent" majority/generation, and had the appearance of
            sameness or "cookie cutter" type of sameness.
     * Baby Boomer—cohort number one—born from approximately 1945 to 1954
          + Distinction: One of two largest generations in size in US
            history.^[citation needed]
          + Memorable events: assassinations of JFK, Robert Kennedy, and
            Martin Luther King, Liberalism, political unrest, walk on the
            moon, Vietnam War, anti-war protests, social experimentation,
            sexual freedom, civil rights movement, environmental movement,
            women's movement, protests and riots, rise and peak of rock
            and roll, and experimentation with various intoxicating
            recreational substances.^[citation needed]

            racism as well sexism and ethnic prejudice, and first
            generation thought to demand an eradication of poverty by
            government programs (War on Poverty).
     * Baby Boomer—cohort number 2—or "Generation Jones" born from
       approximately 1955 to 1964.^[citation needed]
          + Distinction: The Peak years due to being children or teenagers
            when American power peaked in the global scene.
          + Memorable events: Watergate, Nixon's resignation, the Cold
            War, the oil embargo, raging inflation, disco, gasoline
            shortages, the American hostage crisis of Iran (1979–81), the
            U.S. bicentennial celebrations in the 1970s, and cultural
            shift from McCarthyist conformity to hippie idealism to yuppie
            fiscal conservative and/or social liberal phases.^[citation
            needed]
          + Key characteristics: less optimistic, fatalistic, principled,
            general cynicism, somewhat reactionary, easily bored,
            impatient, an urgent desire that things must change, born
            again Christian movement, yuppie social trends, challenged
            gender roles and racial stereotypes, and used drugs illegal
            since the early 20th century^[88]^[89]^[90] thereby
            precipitating the modern War on Drugs in the 1970s and 1980s;
            yet often conservative & reactionary in later age.
     * Generation X—commentators use beginning birth dates from 1961 to
       1981.^[91]
          + In the U.S., some called Generation Xers the "baby bust"
            generation because of the drop in the birth rate following the
            baby boom.^[92] The drop in fertility rates in America began
            in the late 1950s. But according to authors and demographers
            William Strauss and Neil Howe (who use 1961 to 1981 for Gen X
            birth years), there are approximately 88.5 million Gen Xers in
            the U.S. today.^[93]^[94]
          + Memorable events: Challenger explosion, Iran-Contra,
            Reaganomics, AIDS, Star Wars, MTV, home computers, video

            War-fall of Berlin Wall, Gulf War, 1992 L.A. Riots, 1995
            Oklahoma City Bombing, the 1998 Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky

            (21st)/ new millennium (3rd).
          + Key characteristics: pragmatic; independent, informal;
            entrepreneurial; many grew up in single-parent
            households.^[citation needed]
     * The Millennial Generation also known as Generation Y—commentators
       use beginning birth dates from the early 1980s to the early
       2000s.^[95]^[96]
          + Distinction: Echo Boom they are second highest birth rate
            generation in US history.^[citation needed]

            diversity, September 11 attacks, the Death of Osama Bin Laden,
            Afghanistan War and Iraq War, and affected by the 2008–09
            global financial crisis or "Great Recession".
          + Key characteristics: acceptance of change, technically savvy,
            environmental issues, globally minded, more socially liberal
            than previous generations, stricter laws on minors, high tech
            surveillance of public places, political correctness, no
            expectation of military service, and increased local
            volunteerism or community service.
     * Generation Z—also known as the Homeland Generation or "digital
       natives". Sources use beginning birth dates starting at the mid- or
       late 1990s ^[95] or from the mid-2000s ^[97] to the present day.
       This is the generation which is being born.

U.S. demographic birth cohorts[edit]

   Birth rate has dropped since 1957

   Subdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak
   bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted
   bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided
   cohorts may be considered as "pre-peak" (including peak year) and
   "post-peak". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million
   births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as
   trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a
   "bust", there are still a relatively large number of births. The
   dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year,
   and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal
   birth rate. The Baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.^[citation needed]

   From the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the
   introduction of the birth-control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal
   distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from
   1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately
   1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12
   years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as
   anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's,
   Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.^[98]

Ages[edit]

   Median ages are 36.8 years; males are 35.5 years; females are 38.1
   years estimated as of 2010.
   Further information: Children and adolescents in the United States

   As of 2010, people are distributed by age as follows:
     * 0–14 years: 20.2% (male 31,639,127/female 30,305,704)
     * 15–64 years: 67% (male 102,665,043/female 103,129,321)
     * 65 years and over: 12.8% (male 16,901,232/female 22,571,696) (2010
       est.)

Birth, growth, and death rates[edit]

   The growth rate is 0.739% as estimated from 2013-2010 by the US Census
   See also: Birth rate § United States
   Live Births in the United States, 1934–2004.

   The birth rate is 13.5 births/1,000 population, estimated as of 2010.
   This was the lowest in a century. There were 4,136,000 births in
   2009.^[100]

          13.9 births/1,000 population/year (Provisional Data for 2008)
          14.3 births/1,000 population/year (Provisional Data for
          2007)^[101]

   In 2009, Time magazine reported that 40% of births were to unmarried
   women.^[102] The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17%
   Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics, 66% Native Americans, and 72% African
   American.^[103]

   The drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be
   associated with the Late-2000s recession.^[104]

   A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found
   that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and
   2011 were male.^[105]

Death rate[edit]

   As of July 2010, it was estimated that there were 8.38 deaths/1,000
   population.^[citation needed]

   America.^[109] Hence, Latin America is the largest region-of-birth
   group, accounting for over half (53%) of all foreign born population in
   US,^[110] and thus is also the largest source of both legal and illegal
   immigration to US.^[111] In 2011, there are 18.1 million naturalized
   citizens in USA, accounting for 45% of the foreign-born population
   (40.4 million) and 6 percent of the total US population at the
   time,^[112] and around 680,000 legal immigrants are naturalized
   annually.^[113]

Unemployment rate[edit]

   As of July 2014^[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.2 percent
   (U3 Rate).^[115]

   As of February 2014^[update], the U6 unemployment rate is 14.9
   percent.^[116] The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without
   work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U-3 rate), but
   also counts "marginally attached workers and those working part-time
   for economic reasons." Note that some of these part-time workers
   counted as employed by U-3 could be working as little as an hour a
   week. And the "marginally attached workers" include those who have
   gotten discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age
   considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.^[117]

Mobility[edit]

   In 2013, about 15% of Americans moved. Most of these, 67%, moved within
   the same county. Of the 33% who moved beyond local county boundaries,
   13% of those moved more than 200 miles (320 km).^[118]
