   Same-sex marriage is legally recognized in some jurisdictions within
   the United States and by the federal government. Nineteen states,^[a]
   the District of Columbia, and ten Native American tribal
   jurisdictions^[b] issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Several
   hundreds to thousands of marriage licenses were issued to same-sex
   couples in Utah, Michigan, Arkansas, Wisconsin and Indiana between the
   time their bans were struck down by federal or state judges and when
   those rulings were stayed.

   Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law barring federal
   recognition of same-sex marriage in United States v. Windsor on June
   26, 2013, U.S. district courts in thirteen states^[c] and state courts
   in four states^[d] have found that same-sex marriage bans violate the
   U.S. Constitution, and a U.S. district court in one state^[e] and a
   state court in one state^[f] have found that same-sex marriage bans do
   not violate the constitution. The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the
   Fourth,^[20] Seventh,^[21] and Tenth Circuits^[22] have affirmed the
   unconstitutionality of such bans. Additionally, a U.S. district court
   in one state^[g] has struck down a ban on state recognition of
   out-of-state same-sex marriages. A Tennessee recognition decision
   affected only the plaintiff couples.^[24] An order by the Seventh
   Circuit pertaining to an Indiana case forces that state to recognize
   one marriage, where one plaintiff is terminally ill, on an emergency
   basis.^[25] An order issued by a District Court judge forces Indiana to
   recognize a second same-sex marriage, again where one plaintiff is
   terminally ill.^[26] A District Court judge in Arizona has required the
   state to recognize one same-sex marriage for the purpose of issuing a
   death certificate.^[27] Florida recognizes one same-sex marriage and
   the ruling is not stayed. Preliminary injunctions were issued in
   Brenner v. Scott for same-sex couples in Florida; the ruling was
   stayed. All rulings except those affecting Oregon, Pennsylvania, and
   the orders affecting certain couples in Indiana, Arizona, and Florida
   have been stayed pending appeal.

   While many jurisdictions have legalized same-sex marriage through court
   rulings, legislative action, and popular vote, three states prohibit
   same-sex marriage by statute and 28 prohibit it in their
   constitutions.^[28] Section 2 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
   enacted in 1996, allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex
   marriages performed under the laws of other states.

   The movement to obtain civil marriage rights and benefits for same-sex
   couples in the United States began in the 1970s,^[29] but became more
   prominent in American politics in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court
   declared the state's prohibition to be unconstitutional in Baehr v.
   Lewin.^[30] On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state
   and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage
   following the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Goodridge v.
   Department of Public Health six months earlier.^[31] During the 21st
   century, public support for same-sex marriage has grown
   considerably,^[32]^[33] and national polls conducted since 2011 show
   that a majority of Americans support legalizing it. On May 9, 2012,
   Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to publicly
   declare support for the legalization of same-sex marriage.^[34] On
   November 6, 2012, Maine, Maryland, and Washington became the first
   states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote.

Constitutional law: Marriage as a fundamental right[edit]

   The United States Supreme Court has in at least 14 cases since 1888
   ruled that marriage is a fundamental right. These cases are:^[35]
    1. Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 (1888) Marriage is "the most
       important relation in life" and "the foundation of the family and
       society, without which there would be neither civilization nor
       progress."
    2. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) The right "to marry,
       establish a home and bring up children" is a central part of
       liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.
    3. Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942)
       Marriage is "one of the basic civil rights of man" and "fundamental
       to the very existence and survival of the race."
    4. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) "We deal with a right
       of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political
       parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming
       together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate
       to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a
       way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths;
       a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is
       an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior
       decisions."
    5. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967) "The freedom to marry has
       long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential
       to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men."
    6. Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371 (1971) "[M]arriage involves
       interests of basic importance to our society" and is "a fundamental
       human relationship."
    7. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974) "This
       Court has long recognized that freedom of personal choice in
       matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties
       protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
    8. Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977) "[W]hen the
       government intrudes on choices concerning family living
       arrangements, this Court must examine carefully the importance of
       the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they
       are served by the challenged regulation."
    9. Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977)
       "[I]t is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make
       without unjustified government interference are personal decisions
       relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family
       relationships, and child rearing and education."
   10. Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978) "[T]he right to marry is
       of fundamental importance for all individuals."
   11. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) "[T]he decision to marry is a
       fundamental right" and an "expression[ ] of emotional support and
       public commitment."
   12. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) "These matters,
       involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make
       in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy,
       are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of
       existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human
       life."
   13. M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102 (1996) "Choices about marriage,
       family life, and the upbringing of children are among associational
       rights this Court has ranked as 'of basic importance in our
       society,' rights sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the
       State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect."
   14. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) "[O]ur laws and tradition
       afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to
       marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and
       education. ... Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek
       autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do."

Federal law[edit]

   The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are
   determined by the nation's federal system of government, in which the
   status of a person (including marriage) in general is determined by the
   individual states. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define
   marriage; any marriage recognized by a state was recognized by the
   federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or
   more other states (as was the case with interracial marriage before
   1967 due to anti-miscegenation laws). With the passage of the Defense
   of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, a marriage was explicitly defined in
   federal law as a union of one man and one woman.^[36]

   DOMA was challenged in the federal court system. On July 8, 2010, Judge
   Joseph Tauro of the District Court of Massachusetts held that the
   denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts
   same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the
   U.S. Constitution.^[37]^[38] Beginning in 2010, eight federal courts
   found DOMA to be unconstitutional on issues including bankruptcy,
   public employee benefits, estate taxes, and immigration.^[39]^[40]^[41]
   On October 18, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals became the
   first court^[42] to hold sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect
   classification and applied intermediate scrutiny to strike down Section
   3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States.^[43] Windsor
   and four other federal cases were considered for review by the U.S.
   Supreme Court,^[44]^[45] which, on June 26, 2013, held Section 3 to
   violate the Fifth Amendment.^[46]

   As a result of the Windsor decision, married same-sex
   couples—regardless of domicile—have tax benefits (which include the
   previously unavailable ability to file joint tax returns with the IRS),
   military benefits, federal employment benefits for employees of the U.S
   Government and immigration benefits.^[47]^[48]^[49]^[50] In February
   2014, the Justice Department expanded recognition of same-sex marriages
   in federal legal matters, including bankruptcies, prison visits,
   survivor benefits and the legal right to refuse to testify to
   incriminate a spouse.^[51]^[52] Likewise in June 2014, family medical
   leave benefits under the Family Medical Leave Act 1975 were extended to
   married same-sex couples in all of the U.S.^[53]^[54] With respect to
   social security and veterans benefits, same-sex married couples who
   live in states where same-sex marriage is recognized are eligible for
   full benefits from the Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Social Security
   Administration (SSA). The VA and SSA can provide only limited benefits
   to married same-sex couples living in states where same-sex marriage
   isn't legal, with Congress required to amend federal law to rectify
   that inequity.^[54]^[55]^[56]

   According to the federal government's Government Accountability Office
   (GAO) in 2004, more than 1,138 rights and protections are conferred to
   U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected
   include Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance,
   Medicaid, hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings,
   pensions, family leave, and immigration law.^[57]

   Many aspects of marriage law are determined by the states, rather than
   by the federal government. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed
   Baker v. Nelson, a same-sex marriage case filed in Minnesota, "for want
   of a substantial federal question."^[58] In doing so, the court upheld
   Minnesota's right to restrict marriage to different-sex couples.^[59]
   Although the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled Baker, several
   federal courts have held that it is no longer good law. For example, on
   November 15, 2013, a U.S. district court in Pennsylvania denied a
   motion to dismiss in a same-sex marriage case, put forth by defendants
   who argued that Baker v. Nelson was binding precedent. The court wrote
   that "[t]he jurisprudence of equal protection and substantive due
   process has undergone what can only be characterized as a sea change
   since 1972", allowing the case to proceed to trial in 2014.^[60]

   Marriage laws in states that do not permit or recognize same-sex
   marriage have led to court challenges, including Hollingsworth v.
   Perry, which challenged the validity of California's Proposition 8
   under the United States Constitution;^[61] Sevcik v. Sandoval, which
   challenges Nevada's system of marriage for different-sex couples and
   domestic partnerships for same-sex couples under the equal protection
   clause;^[62] and others.

   Opponents of same-sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states
   from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the United
   States Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and
   one woman. In 2006, the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would
   prohibit states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by
   the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote and was debated by
   the full Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both houses of
   Congress.^[63]

   On April 2, 2014, the Alabama state house adopted a resolution calling
   for a constitutional convention to propose an amendment to ban same-sex
   marriage nationwide.^[64]

   Prior to 2004, same-sex marriage was not performed in any U.S.
   jurisdiction. It has since been legalized in different jurisdictions
   through legislation, court rulings,^[65] tribal council rulings,^[66]
   and popular vote in statewide referenda.^[67]^[68]

   As of July 29, 2014, 19 states (California, Connecticut, Delaware,
   Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
   Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
   Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia
   routinely issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

   The U.S. Courts of Appeals are actively involved in hearing same-sex
   marriage cases: the Tenth Circuit affirmed rulings in favor of allowing
   such licenses in cases stemming from Utah and Oklahoma, but stayed its
   decisions; that circuit will now review the Colorado ruling from U.S.
   district court. The Fourth Circuit affirmed that the Virginia same-sex
   marriage ban is unconstitutional. Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and
   Tennessee have received favorable rulings on same-sex marriage in lower
   courts; the Sixth Circuit heard arguments in these cases on August 6,
   2014, and will now decide whether or not to affirm these holdings.
   Indiana and Wisconsin, too, received a ruling favorable to same-sex
   marriage in lower court, and the Seventh Circuit heard arguments in
   these cases on August 26, 2014, and upheld these rulings on September
   4, 2014. Idaho received a ruling favorable to same-sex marriage in
   lower court; however Nevada and Hawaii did not, and the Ninth Circuit
   has heard these appeals on September 8, 2014. Hawaii legalized same-sex
   marriage in December 2013, however plaintiffs seek to have a District
   Court decision upholding Hawaii's former ban overturned. A lower court
   ruling finding for same-sex marriage in Texas has been appealed to the
   Fifth Circuit; this case is still pending.

   A state appellate court in Florida and the state supreme courts of
   Arkansas and Colorado are expected to review lower court rulings in
   favor of allowing same-sex marriage licenses in all or portions of
   those states.

   All jurisdictions in the Northeast Corridor have legalized same-sex
   marriage, as have all Pacific States except Alaska.

   At the same time, Colorado, Nevada, and Wisconsin have created legal
   unions for same-sex couples that offer varying subsets of the rights
   and responsibilities of marriage under the laws of those jurisdictions.

History[edit]

Early history[edit]

   On May 18, 1970, two University of Minnesota gay student activists,
   Richard Baker and James Michael McConnell, applied for a marriage
   license in Minneapolis. The clerk of the Hennepin County District
   Court, Gerald Nelson, denied the request on the sole ground that the
   two were of the same sex.

   The case was appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court which, in 1971,
   ruled that Minnesota's laws prohibited marriages between same-sex
   partners and did not violate the federal constitution. Then, on October
   10, 1972, the United States Supreme Court, declining to hear the case
   on appeal, issued a one-sentence order that said: "The appeal is
   dismissed for want of a substantial federal question."

   In 1998, in response to the Hawaii Supreme Court's ruling in Baehr v.
   Miike, Hawaii voters approved a state constitutional amendment
   ("Amendment 2") allowing their legislature to ban same-sex
   marriage.^[69] In 2003, the US Supreme Court struck down Texas'
   "Homosexual Conduct" law^[70] in Lawrence v. Texas.^[71] The ruling
   effectively nullified similar same-sex sodomy laws in Kansas, Oklahoma
   and Missouri along with broader sodomy laws in nine other states.^[72]

   Same-sex marriage was first recognized by a United States jurisdiction
   on November 18, 2003, pursuant to the ruling of the Massachusetts
   Supreme Judicial Court in Goodridge v. Department of Public
   Health.^[73] This resulted in the first same-sex marriages occurring
   within the Bay State on May 17, 2004,^[74] making Massachusetts the
   first U.S. state to permit same-sex marriage within its borders.

   On February 20, 2004, Sandoval County became the first county in New
   Mexico to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. A restraining
   order was later issued to prohibit the county clerk from issuing
   licenses to same-sex couples for the rest of her term, which ended on
   January 1, 2005.

   On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court of California issued a decision in
   which it effectively legalized same-sex marriage in California, holding
   that California's existing opposite-sex definition of marriage violated
   the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.^[75]^[76] Same-sex
   marriage opponents in California placed a state constitutional
   amendment known as Proposition 8 on the November 2008 ballot for the
   purpose of restoring an opposite-sex definition of marriage.^[77]
   (Proposition 8 was somewhat unusual compared to other initiatives
   connected to same-sex marriage, since California had ratified same-sex
   marriages and Proposition 8 was a response intended to subsequently
   re-remove the right of marriage.) Proposition 8 was passed on Election
   Day 2008, as were proposed marriage-limiting amendments in Florida and
   Arizona.^[78]

   On August 4, 2010, a decision by the U.S. District Court in Perry v.
   Schwarzenegger ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional.^[79] The
   decision in that case was upheld at appeal and – as the State of
   California decided not to appeal or defend Proposition 8 – the voters
   who initially instigated the initiative appealed to the Supreme Court,
   which asked to be briefed for arguments concerning the appellants'
   standing, and heard oral arguments on March 26, 2013.^[80] In
   accordance with numerous precedent cases rejecting the concept of
   proponents' standing to defend a challenged law in Federal court, the
   Supreme Court dismissed the case for lack of standing in a decision
   issued June 26, 2013,^[81] after which same-sex marriage once again
   became legal in California.^[82] Proposition 8 supporters have
   expressed the intent to fight on (for example by asserting the ruling
   only applies to the persons or counties involved), but this was
   rejected by California's Attorney General Kamala Harris, who noted that
   "state officials are obligated to govern marriage equally in all
   counties and that Walker's ruling specifically covers those
   officials".^[83] Same-sex marriages resumed on June 28, 2013.^[84]

   On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned the
   state's civil unions statute as unconstitutionally discriminatory
   against same-sex couples, and required the state to recognize same-sex
   marriages.^[85] The following year, the state general assembly passed
   gender-neutral marriage legislation, which the state's Republican
   governor signed into law.^[86]

   In 2007, the Polk County District Court ruled in favor of six same-sex
   couples in Varnum v. Brien for the right to marry. On April 3, 2009, a
   unanimous Iowa Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling.^[87] This
   decision was initially scheduled to take effect on April 24, but for
   administrative reasons the date was changed to April 27, when the
   licenses became available.^[88]

   On December 18, 2009, a same-sex marriage became legal when mayor
   Adrian Fenty signed a bill passed by the Council of the District of
   Columbia;^[89] same-sex marriage licenses became available in
   Washington, D.C., on March 3, 2010.^[90] The first same-sex marriages
   took place on March 9.

   By 2009, New England became the center of an organized push to legalize
   same-sex marriage,^[91] which was achieved in all six states in that
   region by 2013 when Rhode Island legalized such marriages. On April 7,
   2009, Vermont legalized same-sex marriage through legislation. The
   Governor of Vermont had previously vetoed the measure, but the veto was
   overridden by the Legislature. Vermont became the first state in the
   United States to legalize same-sex marriage through legislative means
   rather than litigation. On May 6, 2009, Maine Governor John Baldacci
   signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, becoming the first state
   governor to do so.^[92] Nonetheless, the legislation was stayed pending
   a vote and never went into effect. It was repealed by referendum in
   November 2009.^[65] On June 3, 2009, New Hampshire became the sixth
   state nationally to legalize same-sex marriage.^[93]

2010s[edit]

   As of January 2010^[update], 29 states had constitutional provisions
   restricting marriage to one man and one woman, while 12 others had
   statutes that did so.^[94] Nineteen states banned any legal recognition
   of same-sex unions that would be equivalent to civil marriage.^[95] In
   28 out of 30 states where constitutional amendments or initiatives that
   define marriage as the union of a man and a woman were put on the
   ballot in a referendum, voters approved such amendments.^[h] Arizonans
   voted down one such amendment in 2006,^[96] but approved a different
   amendment to that effect in 2008.^[97] In 2012, Minnesota became the
   second state to reject an amendment to its state constitution banning
   same-sex marriage, though Democrats increased their numbers in the
   legislature in the same election, leading to the May 2013 enactment of
   same-sex marriage legislation there.^[98] A bill that would have
   legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey was vetoed by Governor Chris
   Christie on February 17, 2012^[99] before a New Jersey Superior Court
   ruling led to its legalization in October 2013.

   Prior to the November 2012 election, Maryland recognized same-sex
   marriages formed in other jurisdictions, but did not allow forming such
   marriages within its borders.^[100] New York had been in a similar
   situation as its courts had held that same-sex marriages conducted in
   states where they are legal must be recognized by those states, but
   that the state statutes did not allow the issuance of same-sex marriage
   licenses,^[101] a situation which changed when its legislature
   legalized granting licenses to same-sex couples in 2011.

   On May 8, 2012, North Carolina voters approved a constitutional
   amendment banning same-sex marriage as well as all other types of
   same-sex unions. The North Carolina vote was held on the same day as
   the Republican Presidential primary,^[102] therefore disproportionally
   drawing more Republicans to this special election. The amendment was
   approved 61.04% to 38.96%, with a voter turnout of 34.66%.^[103] North
   Carolina already prohibited same-sex marriages by statute.

   In the regular November 2012 elections, however, state voters for the
   first time approved same-sex marriage by popular vote, in Maine,
   Maryland, and Washington. Maine's law took effect on December 29,
   2012.^[104] By law, Maryland started allowing same-sex marriages on
   January 1, 2013,^[105] The Washington legislature had enacted
   legislation in February 2012 that would institute same-sex marriage in
   the state, but the enactment was stayed pending a voter referendum,
   which passed. The referendum was certified on December 5, 2012, and the
   first licenses were distributed on December 6, with the first marriages
   on December 9 following the mandatory three day waiting
   period.^[106]^[107] In the same election, Minnesota became the second
   state to reject a statewide constitutional ban against same-sex
   marriage by a popular vote.^[108]^[109]

   Several governments enacted same-sex marriage in 2013. The Little
   Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians of Michigan voted in March 2013 to
   legalize same-sex marriages under their tribal jurisdiction, although
   the state maintained that it would not recognize the marriages.^[66]
   The Rhode Island legislature passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage
   on May 2, which took effect August 1;^[110] Delaware enacted
   legislation on May 7, which took effect July 1;^[111] and Minnesota
   enacted legislation on May 14, which took effect August 1.^[112] In
   July 2013, a court clerk in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania began
   issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, with the rationale that
   the state marriage statutes are unconstitutional,^[113] but his action
   was overruled by a state intermediate appellate court in September and
   he was ordered to cease issuing the licenses.^[114]

   New Jersey began issuing same-sex marriage licenses on October 21,
   2013, following a September 27 state superior court decision which
   found an equal protection guarantee for same-sex couples. Governor
   Chris Christie originally filed an appeal to the New Jersey Supreme
   Court, but withdrew it after the court declined to issue a stay on the
   lower court's ruling.^[115]^[116]^[117]^[118]

   In October and November 2013, both houses of the Hawaii legislature
   enacted legislation legalizing same-sex marriage, which Governor Neil
   Abercrombie signed on November 13. The law took effect on December 2,
   2013.^[119] The Illinois General Assembly passed a bill legalizing
   same-sex marriage on November 5, 2013. The House of Representatives
   narrowly passed an amended version of an earlier Senate bill 61–54–2
   with the Senate approving the House version 32–21 only about an hour
   later. Governor Pat Quinn signed the legislation on November 20.^[120]
   On February 21, 2014 U.S District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman ruled
   that same-sex couples in Cook County, which includes Illinois' largest
   city Chicago, can obtain marriage licenses immediately and need not
   wait until the law's June 1 effective date.^[121] On February 26, 2014,
   a Champaign County clerk began issuing same-sex marriage licenses after
   consulting the State's Attorney and concluding that the Cook County
   order is applicable.^[122]

   In 2013, certain New Mexico counties, either on the basis of a court
   decision or their clerks' own volition, began issuing marriage licenses
   to same-sex couples. In August 2013, Doña Ana County^[123] and Santa Fe
   County began issuing same-sex marriage licenses, the latter through a
   court order.^[124]^[125]^[126]^[127]^[128] Although opponents filed for
   an injunction,^[129] same-sex marriage expanded to a total of eight New
   Mexico counties.^[130] On December 19, 2013, the state Supreme Court
   ruled unanimously that, effective immediately, same-sex marriage would
   be permitted throughout the state.^[131]

   On December 20, 2013, Judge Robert J. Shelby of the U.S. District Court
   for Utah struck down Utah's same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional
   in Kitchen v. Herbert.^[132] Salt Lake County began issuing marriage
   licenses immediately, followed by other counties.^[133] After failing
   to get the District Court or the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay
   the decision pending appeal, Utah state officials asked for a stay from
   the United States Supreme Court, which granted the request on January
   6, 2014.^[2]^[134] The stay allowed Utah to reinstate its ban on
   same-sex marriage and deny state services to married same-sex
   couples.^[135] On January 10, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
   announced that the federal government would recognize the marriages of
   same-sex couples who married in Utah between December 20, 2013, and
   January 6, 2014.^[136] The Tenth Circuit ordered the appeals process to
   be heard on an expedited basis^[137] and set a briefing schedule to be
   completed by February 25.^[138]

   On January 14, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Terence C. Kern ruled in
   Bishop v. Oklahoma that Oklahoma's ban on same-sex marriage is
   unconstitutional. He stayed his ruling pending appeal.^[3] On January
   23, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring announced that the state
   would reverse its position and support a federal lawsuit challenging
   the Virginia state constitution's ban on same-sex marriage.^[139] On
   January 21, a 3-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
   considering issues unrelated to marriage in SmithKline Beecham
   Corporation v. Abbott Laboratories, ruled that distinctions based on
   sexual orientation are subject to the "heightened scrutiny" standard of
   review.^[140] In response to that decision, on February 10, Nevada
   State Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto withdrew the state's
   brief in Sevcik v. Sandoval, ending its defense of the state's ban on
   same-sex marriage.^[141] Because the decision in SmithKline was not
   appealed, heightened scrutiny remains the standard of review in the
   Ninth Circuit for laws and government actions that draw distinctions
   based on sexual orientation.^[142]

   On February 12, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn declared Kentucky's
   refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions
   unconstitutional.^[143]^[144] On February 27, Judge Heyburn issued an
   order requiring the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in
   other jurisdictions,^[145] but the next day he stayed that order until
   March 20.^[146] On March 19, the stay was extended pending action by
   the Sixth Circuit, noting the stay granted by the U.S. Supreme Court in
   Kitchen v. Herbert.^[147] Additionally, on July 1, a judge ruled
   in Love v. Beshear that the ban on performing same-sex marriage within
   Kentucky was unconstitutional, and also stayed the ruling.^[148]

   On February 13, Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen of the U.S. District Court
   for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that the state's ban on
   same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. She stayed enforcement of her
   ruling in Bostic v. Rainey pending appeal.^[149]

   On February 26, U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia ruled in De Leon v.
   Perry that Texas's ban on same-sex marriage is a "state-imposed
   inequality," striking them down.^[150] He immediately stayed the effect
   of his ruling, pending an appeal. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott
   said that he will appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
   the Fifth Circuit.^[151]

   On March 4, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan issued an opinion
   that a recent court decision ordering Cook County to issue marriage
   licenses immediately did not apply to all county clerks, but advised
   clerks that they should find the decision "persuasive as you evaluate
   whether to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples." Governor Pat
   Quinn then announced that the Illinois Department of Public Health
   would record marriages issued by any county clerk.^[152] Several of the
   state's 102 county clerks began, or announced plans to begin, issuing
   marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March.^[153]

   On March 21, U.S. District Court Judge Bernard A. Friedman issued a
   decision that found Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage
   unconstitutional. He did not stay enforcement of his decision. Michigan
   Attorney General Bill Schuette filed an emergency request with the
   Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay pending appeal.^[154]
   Hundreds of same-sex couples obtained marriage licenses and some
   married in Michigan on the morning of March 22 before the appeals court
   temporarily stayed enforcement of the ruling until March 26.^[155] On
   March 25, the stay pending appeal was granted by the appellate court.

   On May 9, 2014, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza struck down
   Arkansas' constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.^[156] On May 14, The
   Arkansas Supreme Court has rejected Attorney General Dustin McDaniel's
   request to stay the judge's ruling; however, the preliminary ruling
   addressed the existence of a state statutory ban not specifically
   overturned by the ruling.^[157] When the statutory ban was struck down,
   on May 15, the Arkansas Supreme Court issued a stay.

   On May 13, U.S. District Magistrate Judge Candy Dale in Latta v. Otter
   has issued a ruling striking down Idaho's ban on marriage for same-sex
   couples and ordering the state to allow same-sex couples to marry in
   Idaho and to recognize the marriages of couples who married in other
   states.^[158]^[159] But on May 15, a three-judge panel of the Ninth
   U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary stay while it
   considers whether a longer stay is needed. Gov. Butch Otter and
   Attorney General Lawrence Wasden both asked that Dale’s ruling be
   placed on hold while they appeal.^[160]

   On May 19, U.S. District judge Michael J. McShane ruled in Geiger v.
   Kitzhaber that Oregon's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional,
   striking it down.^[161] Judge McShane ordered marriages to begin
   immediately.^[162] The National Organization for Marriage filed a
   petition to intervene as defendants in the case, two days before oral
   arguments; the petition was denied. Both the Ninth Circuit Court of
   Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States denied NOM's
   emergency request for a stay on Judge McShane's ruling, thereby
   permanently legalizing same-sex marriage in the
   state.^[162]^[163]^[164]

   On May 20, 2014, Judge John E. Jones III of the United States District
   Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania struck down
   Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban in his ruling in Whitewood v.
   Wolf.^[165] Governor Tom Corbett said he will not appeal the court
   decision, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in
   Pennsylvania.^[166] One county clerk has decided to intervene in,
   appeal, and stay the decision. The trial court denied intervention and
   the stay of judgment, and the Third Circuit affirmed. On July 7, 2014,
   the clerk applied to the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay. U.S. Supreme
   Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Circuit Justice for the Third
   Circuit, denied the clerk's application for a stay on July 8, 2014, and
   the Third Circuit denied the clerk's petition to rehear her case for
   intervention on August 4, 2014.^[167]^[168]

   On June 6, 2014, Judge Barbara Bandriff Crabb of the United States
   District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin struck down
   Wisconsin's same-sex marriage ban in Wolf v. Walker.^[169] No immediate
   injunction to stop enforcement of the ban was ordered,^[170] and county
   clerks in at least 60 counties have begun to issue marriage licenses to
   same-sex couples.^[171] After Judge Barbara Crabb refused to stay her
   ruling, Wisconsin's attorney general J. B. Van Hollen requested a stay
   from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. On June 13, the
   judge put the ruling on hold, pending appeal.^[172]

   On June 25, 2014, the Tenth Circuit Court affirmed Judge Robert
   Shelby's ruling striking Utah's same-sex marriage ban.^[173] It is the
   first time a federal appeals court has recognized that same-sex couples
   have the same fundamental right to marry as all Americans.^[173] "We
   hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to
   marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full
   protection of a state’s marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance
   of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their
   marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage
   union," the appellate court said.^[173] The judgment was stayed pending
   review from the Supreme Court.^[174]^[175] Boulder County in Colorado,
   a state covered by the tenth circuit, began issuing licenses despite
   the stay until ordered by the Colorado Supreme Court to stop. The Tenth
   Circuit ruling created a circuit split on the issue of same-sex
   marriage by being directly opposed to Citizens for Equal Protection v.
   Bruning (2006) from the Eighth Circuit. A circuit split gives the US
   Supreme Court a reason to rule on an issue, but the Eighth Circuit
   might reverse its ruling before then.^[176] The same day, Judge Richard
   L. Young from United States District Court for the Southern District of
   Indiana ruled Indiana's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional.
   Young did not issue a stay on his ruling and instructed all state
   agencies to provide marital benefits to same-sex couples.^[177] Two
   days later, the order was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
   Seventh Circuit pending appeal.^[178]

   On July 9, 2014, Judge C. Scott Crabtree of the Colorado 17th Judicial
   District Court struck down Colorado's same-sex marriage ban in Brinkman
   v. Long, holding that the state's "marriage bans violate plaintiffs’
   due process and equal protection guarantees under the Fourteenth
   Amendments to the U.S. Constitution."^[179] Judge Crabtree immediately
   stayed the decision pending appeal. The next day, another state judge
   declined to stop the Boulder County clerk that had been issuing
   licenses, and Denver County began issuing licenses. On July 11, Pueblo
   County began issuing licenses as well.^[180] On July 23, in Burns v.
   Hickenlooper, U.S. District Judge Raymond P. Moore also ruled that the
   Colorado's ban against same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. On July
   29, the Colorado Supreme Court ordered Boulder County to stop issuing
   marriage licenses to same-sex couples, halting the practice a month
   after a handful of county clerks had defied a ban in the State
   Constitution. Clerks in Pueblo County and Denver County have also
   stopped issuing marriage license to same-sex couples as well.^[181] On
   August 21, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stayed the
   effect of Burns pending disposition of petitions for certiorari in that
   case by the U.S. Supreme Court.

   On July 17, 2014, a Florida state circuit judge, Luis M. Garcia,
   overturned the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. This
   ruling applies only to Monroe County, Florida, and includes the Florida
   Keys. The ruling has been stayed pending appeal.^[182] A similar ruling
   on July 25 overturned the ban in Miami-Dade County but was also
   stayed.^[183] The ban was also overturned and stayed in Broward County
   on August 4, 2014 and Palm Beach County on August 5. On August 21, U.S.
   District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that Florida's ban on same-sex
   marriage violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and
   due process under the law, striking it down. The judge immediately
   stayed his ruling, pending further appeals.^[184]

   On July 28, 2014, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed
   the unconstitutionality of Virgina's ban on same-sex marriage in Bostic
   v. Schaefer.^[185]^[186] The U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on August
   20, 2014, one day before the Fourth Circuit's mandate was to go into
   effect.

   On September 4, 2014, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
   for the Seventh Circuit unanimously affirmed the unconstitutionality of
   Indiana and Wisconsin's bans on same-sex marriage in Baskin v.
   Bogan.^[187] The Court issued a stay on its decision for 21 days
   pending appeal.

States that license same-sex marriage (table)[edit]

   Note: This table shows only states that license same-sex marriages or
   have legalized it. It does not include states that recognize same-sex

Tribal laws[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage under United States tribal
   jurisdictions

   In the United States, federally recognized Native American tribes have
   the legal right to form their own marriage laws.^[213] There are ten
   tribal jurisdictions that legally recognize same-sex marriage: the
   Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes,^[214] the Confederated Tribes of the
   Colville Reservation,^[215] the Coquille Tribe,^[216] the Little
   Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians,^[217] the Mashantucket Pequot
   Tribe,^[218] the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians,^[219] the Puyallup
   tribe,^[220] the Santa Ysabel Tribe,^[221] the Leech Lake Band of
   Ojibwe,^[222] and the Suquamish tribe.^[223] The legality of same-sex
   marriage is currently on hold in the Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians
   due to Michigan's same-sex marriage ban being challenged.

Debate[edit]

Support[edit]

   See also: List of supporters of same-sex marriage in the United States
   Rally for same-sex marriage (May 2009, San Francisco, California)

   Same-sex marriage supporters make several arguments in support of their
   position. Gail Mathabane likens prohibitions on same-sex marriage to
   past U.S. prohibitions on interracial marriage.^[224] Fernando Espuelas
   argues that same-sex marriage should be allowed because same-sex
   marriage extends a civil right to a minority group.^[225] According to
   an American history scholar, Nancy Cott, "there really is no
   comparison, because there is nothing that is like marriage except
   marriage."^[226]

   The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is one of the leading advocacy groups
   in support of same-sex marriage. According to the HRC's website, "Many
   same-sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in
   love—many, in fact, have spent the last 10, 20 or 50 years with that
   person—and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way
   our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand
   together in good times and bad, through all the joys and challenges
   family life brings."^[227]

   The leading associations of psychological, psychiatric, medical, and
   social work professionals in the United States such as American
   Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American
   Sociological Association, American Medical Association, American
   Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Nursing and National
   Association of Social Workers have said that claims that the legal
   recognition of marriage for same–sex couples undermines the institution
   of marriage and harms children is inconsistent with the scientific
   evidence which supports the conclusions: that homosexuality is a normal
   expression of human sexuality that is not chosen; that gay and lesbian
   people form stable, committed relationships essentially equivalent to
   heterosexual relationships; that same-sex parents are no less capable
   than opposite-sex parents to raise children; and that the children of
   same-sex parents are no less psychologically healthy and well-adjusted
   than children of opposite-sex
   parents.^[228]^[229]^[230]^[231]^[232]^[233]^[234] The body of research
   strongly supports the conclusion that discrimination by the federal
   government between married same-sex couples and married opposite-sex
   couples in granting benefits unfairly stigmatizes same-sex couples. The
   research also contradicts the stereotype-based rationales advanced to
   support passage of DOMA that the Equal Protection Clause was designed
   to prohibit.^[235]

   Garden State Equality states that the wording "same-sex marriage"
   implies a separate, and therefore unequal, category of marriage.^[236]
   The 2012 Democratic Party Platform used the term "marriage equality" in
   its support.^[237]

Role of social media[edit]

   Supporters of the legalization of same-sex marriage have successfully
   used social media websites such as Facebook to help achieve that
   goal.^[238]^[239]^[240] Some have argued that the successful use of
   social media websites by LGBT groups has played a key role in the
   defeat of religion-based opposition.^[241]

   One of the largest scale uses of social media to mobilize support for
   same-sex marriage preceded and coincided with the arrival at the US
   Supreme Court of high-profile legal cases for Proposition 8 and the
   Defense of Marriage Act in March 2013. The 'red equals sign' project
   started by the Human Rights Campaign was an electronic campaign
   primarily based on Facebook which encouraged users to change their
   profile images to a red equal sign to express support for same-sex
   marriage.^[242] At the time of the court hearings it was estimated that
   approximately 2.5 million Facebook users changed their profile images
   to a red equals sign.^[243]

Opposition[edit]

   Rally for Prop 8 in Fresno, California (October 2008)
   See also: List of opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States

   Opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States ground their
   arguments on parenting concerns, religious concerns, concerns that
   changes to the definition of marriage would lead to the inclusion of
   polygamy or incest, and in natural law-based reasoning.^[244] The
   Southern Baptist Convention adopted a statement in June 2003 that
   legalizing same-sex relationships would "convey a societal approval of
   a homosexual lifestyle, which the Bible calls sinful and dangerous both
   to the individuals involved and to society at large".^[245] The Church
   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United States Conference of
   Catholic Bishops, the Southern Baptist Convention, and National
   Organization for Marriage claim that children do best when raised by a
   mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore,
   contrary to the best interests of children.^[246]^[247]^[248]^[249]
   Maggie Gallagher of the National Organization for Marriage has raised
   concerns about the impact of same-sex marriage upon religious liberty
   and upon faith-based charities in the United States.^[250] Opponents of
   same-sex marriage have claimed that redefining marriage to include
   same-sex relationships would have harmful effects on biological family,
   children's rights, and social welfare.^[251]^[252] Stanley Kurtz of the
   Weekly Standard has written that same-sex marriage would eventually
   lead to the legalization of polygamy and polyamory, or group marriage,
   in the United States.^[253]

   The funding of the amendment referendum campaigns has been an issue of
   great dispute. Both judges^[254]^[255] and the IRS^[256] have ruled
   that it is either questionable or illegal for campaign contributions to
   be shielded by anonymity. In February 2012, the National Organization
   for Marriage vowed to spend $250,000 in Washington legislative races to
   defeat the Republican state senators who voted for same-sex
   marriage.^[257]

Obama administration[edit]

   President Barack Obama explains his change of view on same-sex marriage
   with Robin Roberts of ABC's Good Morning America, in the Cabinet Room
   of the White House, May 9, 2012.

   In the first half of 2009, it was reported that Barack Obama opposed a
   federal mandate for same-sex marriage, and also opposed the Defense of
   Marriage Act,^[258] stating that individual states should decide the
   issue.^[259]^[260] Obama opposed Proposition 8—California's
   constitutional ban on same-sex marriage—in 2008.^[261] In December
   2010, the White House website stated that the president supported full
   civil unions and federal rights for LGBT couples and opposed a
   constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.^[262] He also stated that his
   position on same-sex marriage was "evolving" and that he recognized
   that civil unions from the perspective of same-sex couples was "not
   enough", before subsequently declaring his full support for the
   legalization of same-sex marriage in 2012.^[263]

   On May 9, 2012, President Obama announced in an interview with ABC News
   that after wrestling with the subject for many years, he had come to
   believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. In the same
   interview, he stated his belief that individual states should have the
   final say as to whether same-sex marriage is recognized. The
   announcement made Obama the first United States president to publicly
   declare his support of same-sex marriage while in office, and marked a
   departure from his previous stance on the issue.^[34]^[264]^[265]^[266]
   During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama had stated, "I believe
   that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. For me as a
   Christian, it is a sacred union. You know, God is in the mix."^[267]
   although he remained supportive of the rights of individuals who
   identified as gay or lesbian.^[262] Obama had previously made comments
   in support of same-sex marriage as early as the 1990s during his
   campaign for the Illinois Senate.^[268] In a 1996 newspaper interview,
   Obama stated "I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight
   efforts to prohibit such marriages."^[269]

   In the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, the campaign of the
   Democratic presidential ticket (Obama-Biden) continually emphasized the
   administration's support for marriage equality, making it a key part of
   the campaign. President Obama was reelected and mentioned LGBT rights
   and marriage equality both explicitly and implicitly in both his
   victory speech on November 7, 2012, and in his inauguration speech on
   January 21, 2013.

Politicians and media figures[edit]

   Former presidents Bill Clinton^[270] and Jimmy Carter,^[271] former
   vice presidents Dick Cheney^[272] and Al Gore,^[273] Walter
   Mondale^[274] and current Vice President Joe Biden have voiced their
   support for legal recognition, as have former first ladies Laura
   Bush^[275] and Hillary Clinton.^[276] Former president George H. W.
   Bush and his wife Barbara have served as witnesses to a same-sex
   wedding, but neither has publicly stated whether this means they
   support same-sex marriage in general.^[277] In May 2012, Barack Obama
   became the first sitting President to support same-sex marriage.^[34]
   In March 2013, Rob Portman became the first sitting Republican senator
   to endorse same-sex marriage.^[278] After the Supreme Court heard
   arguments in Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor the
   same month, support for same-sex marriage in the Senate increased. 15
   Senators announced their support in the following weeks,^[279]
   including another Republican, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois. A majority
   of the Senate now supports same-sex marriage.^[280] In June 2013, Lisa
   Murkowski of Alaska became the third Republican senator to endorse
   same-sex marriage.^[281] In June 2014, Susan Collins of Maine became
   the fourth Republican senator endorse same-sex marriage.^[282]

   During the 2008 presidential election campaign, then-Republican Vice
   Presidential candidate Sarah Palin stated: "I have voted along with the
   vast majority of Alaskans who had the opportunity to vote to amend our
   Constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. I wish
   on a federal level that that's where we would go because I don't
   support gay marriage."^[283]

   Congressman Barney Frank voiced his concern in September 2009 with
   regard to the ability to obtain sufficient votes to overturn the
   Defense of Marriage Act: "If we had a chance to pass that, it would be
   a different story, but I don't think it's a good idea to rekindle that
   debate when there's no chance of passage in the near term."^[284] In
   2009, Pelosi described the difficulty in repealing the Defense of
   Marriage Act: "I would like to get rid of all of it. But the fact is we
   have to make decisions on what we can pass at a given time. It doesn't
   mean the other issues are not important. It is a matter of getting the
   votes and the legislative floor time to do it."^[285]

   Commenting on the decision by U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker
   regarding Proposition 8 in California, former Speaker of the House of
   Representatives Newt Gingrich issued a statement in opposition to
   same-sex marriage, which read, in part, as follows: "Judge Walker's
   ruling overturning Prop 8 is an outrageous disrespect for our
   Constitution and for the majority of people of the United States who
   believe marriage is the union of husband and wife... Congress now has
   the responsibility to act immediately to reaffirm marriage as a union
   of one man and one woman as our national policy."^[286] Gingrich, whose
   sister is openly gay,^[287] later commented that he could accept
   civil—but not religious—same-sex marriages, and encouraged the
   Republican Party to accept the "reality" of same-sex marriage becoming
   legal.^[288]

   Then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi expressed her support for Judge
   Walker's decision: "I am extremely encouraged by the ruling today,
   which found that Proposition 8 violated both the due process and equal
   protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution. Proposition 8 has taken
   away individual rights and freedoms, and is a stain upon the California
   Constitution. We must continue to fight against discriminatory marriage
   amendments and work toward the day when all American families are
   treated equally."^[289]

   In an O'Reilly Factor interview in August 2010, when Glenn Beck was
   asked if he "believe(s) that gay marriage is a threat to [this] country
   in any way", he stated, "No I don't...I believe that Thomas Jefferson
   said: 'If it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket what difference
   is it to me?'"^[290]^[291]

   On his radio show in August 2010, Rush Limbaugh made the following
   comments: "Marriage? There's a definition of it, for it. It means
   something. Marriage is a union of a man and woman. It's always been
   that. If you want to get married and you're a man, marry a woman.
   Nobody's stopping you. This is about tearing apart an
   institution."^[292]

   As of 2013^[update], public support for same-sex marriage in the United
   States has solidified above 50%.^[293]^[294]^[295] Public support for
   same-sex marriage has grown at an increasing pace since the 1990s.^[32]
   In 1996, just 25% of Americans supported legalization of same-sex
   marriage. Polls have shown that support is identical among whites and
   Hispanics, while support for same-sex marriage trails among
   blacks.^[296] Polling trends in 2010 and 2011 showed support for
   same-sex marriage gaining a majority, although the difference is within
   the error limit of the analysis.^[297] On May 20, 2011, Gallup reported
   majority support for same-sex marriage for the first time in the
   country.^[298] In June 2011, two prominent polling organizations
   released an analysis of the changing trend in public opinion about
   same-sex marriage in the United States, concluding that "public support
   for the freedom to marry has increased, at an accelerating rate, with
   most polls showing that a majority of Americans now support full
   marriage rights for all Americans."^[299]

   A Washington Post/ABC News poll from February–March 2014 found a record
   high of 59% of Americans approve of same-sex marriage, with only 34%
   opposed and 7% with no opinion.^[300] In May 2013, a Gallup poll showed
   that 53% of Americans would vote for a law legalizing same-sex marriage
   in all 50 states. Three previous readings over the course of a year
   consistently showed support at 50% or above. Gallup noted: "Just three
   years ago, support for gay marriage was 44%. The current 53% level of
   support is essentially double the 27% in Gallup's initial measurement
   on gay marriage, in 1996."^[301] Some commentators, however, have noted
   instances where polling data has understated voter opposition to
   referendums banning same-sex marriage.^[302] One 2010 study concluded
   that "polls on gay marriage ballot initiatives generally under-estimate
   the opposition to gay marriage by about seven percentage points".^[303]

Effects of same-sex marriage[edit]

Economic impact on same-sex couples[edit]

   In June 2013, the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Windsor
   struck down section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act and required the
   federal government to treat legally married same-sex couples on an
   equal basis with heterosexual married couples. Before that ruling,
   however, same-sex married couples faced a number of severe
   disadvantages. While some states extended full marriage rights to
   same-sex couples within their borders, until section 3 of DOMA was
   struck down none of those legally married couples were recognized by
   the federal government for any purpose, financial or otherwise.

   According to a 1997 General Accounting Office study requested by Rep.
   Henry Hyde (R), at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations
   include reference to marital status.^[304] A later 2004 study by the
   Congressional Budget Office found 1,138 statutory provisions "in which
   marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits,
   rights, and privileges.'"^[305] Many of these laws govern property
   rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples whose marriages are
   not recognized by the federal government were ineligible for spousal
   and survivor Social Security benefits.^[305] Badgett's research found
   that the resulting difference in Social Security income for same-sex
   couples compared to opposite-sex married couples was US$5,588 per year.

   The federal ban on same-sex marriage and benefits through the 1996
   Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) also extended to federal government
   employee benefits.^[305] According to Badgett's work, same-sex couples
   faced the following other financial disadvantages against which legal
   marriage at least partially shielded opposite-sex couples:^[306]
     * Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to
       gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage,
       including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and
       inheritance^[306]
     * A legal spouse could inherit an unlimited amount from the deceased
       without incurring an estate tax but a same-sex partner would have
       to pay the estate tax on the inheritance from her/his partner^[305]
     * Same-sex couples were not eligible to file jointly as a married
       couple and thus could not take the advantages of lower tax rates
       when the individual income of the partners differs
       significantly^[305] (however, in early 2013 the IRS did recognize
       the community property and income of same-sex partners in community
       property states^[307])
     * Only 18% of companies offered domestic partner health care
       benefits^[306]
     * Employer-provided health insurance coverage for a same-sex partner
       incurred federal income tax, unlike like coverage provided to a
       heterosexual couple^[305]
     * Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and
       preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples had a member who was
       uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples^[306]
     * Inability to protect jointly owned home from loss due to costs of
       potential medical catastrophe^[306]
     * Inability of a U.S. citizen to sponsor a same-sex spouse for
       citizenship, as married heterosexuals automatically could^[306]

   Some 7,400 companies were offering spousal benefits to same-sex couples
   as of 2008. In states that recognize same-sex marriages, same-sex
   couples can continue to receive those same benefits only if they
   marry.^[308]

Potential economic disadvantages[edit]

   While the legal benefits of marriage are numerous, same-sex couples
   could face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as
   opposite-sex married couples. Such potential effects include the
   marriage penalty in taxation.^[305] Similarly, while social service
   providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income
   means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner,
   a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in
   calculating whether a married individual qualifies for
   assistance.^[305]

Economic impact on the federal government[edit]

   The 2004 Congressional Budget Office study, working from an assumption
   "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages
   if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted
   "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage
   throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to
   a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years".
   This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased
   income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased
   tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition
   would increase the government expenses for Social Security and Federal
   Employee Health Benefits but that increase would be more than made up
   for by decreased expenses for Medicaid, Medicare, and Supplemental
   Security Income.^[305]

Mental health[edit]

   Based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse
   effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians, numerous prominent
   social science organizations have issued position statements supporting
   same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual
   orientation; these organizations include the American Psychoanalytic
   Association and the American Psychological Association.^[235]

   Several psychological studies^[309]^[310]^[311] have shown that an
   increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about
   same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population
   that may affect their health and well-being.

   One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults
   across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that
   have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "minority
   stress"—the chronic social stress that results from minority-group
   stigmatization—as well as general psychological distress. According to
   the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly
   responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that
   minority stress is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior
   and substance abuse.^[312]

   Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their
   families living in Memphis, Tennessee, immediately after a successful
   2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents
   reported feeling alienated from their communities. The studies also
   found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress,
   says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the University of
   Memphis.^[313]

   At the Perry v. Schwarzenegger trial, expert witness Ilan Meyer
   testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would
   improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because "when
   people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get
   sick..." and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say
   to gay people "you are not welcome here, your relationships are not
   valued." Such laws have "significant power", he said.^[314]

Physical health[edit]

   In 2009, a pair of economists at Emory University tied the passage of
   state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates
   of HIV infection.^[315]^[316] The study linked the passage of same-sex
   marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within
   that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

   A study by the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health found that gay
   men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often
   following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.^[317]

       of a marriage license to two women in Kentucky based on dictionary

2010s[edit]

     * Gill v. Office of Personnel Management (2009–2013), Section 3 of
       the federal Defense of Marriage Act is found unconstitutional in
       U.S. district court. This ruling is affirmed by the First Circuit
       Court of Appeals. Implementation stayed pending Windsor (see below)
       which ultimately resolves this case by finding Section 3
       unconstitutional; hence Gill is dismissed.
     * Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human
       Services (2009–2013), Decided alongside Gill (above). Same outcome.
     * Port v. Cowan (2010–2012), Maryland must recognize valid
       out-of-state same-sex marriages under doctrine of comity.^[325]
     * Hollingsworth v. Perry (2009–2013), California's proposition
       banning same-sex marriage is found unconstitutional in U.S.
       district court, Perry v. Schwarzenegger. Proposition backers appeal
       to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where they are found to have
       standing, but the district court's finding of unconstitutionality
       is narrowly upheld, Perry v. Brown. U.S. Supreme Court finds
       proposition backers lack standing, dismisses appeal, instructs the
       Ninth Circuit to vacate the appeal below, leaving the district
       court ruling intact.^[326]
     * Windsor v. United States (2010–2013) Section 3 of the federal
       Defense of Marriage Act is found unconstitutional in U.S. district
       court. This ruling is affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of
       Appeals, and after granting the petition of certiorari, affirmed by
       the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. government began implementing the
       decision the same week.^[327]^[328]
     * Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management (2010–2013), Section 3
       of the federal Defense of Marriage Act is found unconstitutional in
       U.S. district court, and that homosexuality is a quasi-suspect
       classification, meaning that discrimination in legislation such as
       the Act must substantially relate to an important government
       interest ("intermediate scrutiny"). On appeal case is held in
       abeyance pending the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Windsor.
       Since Windsor finds the same Section 3 unconstitutional, the appeal
       is ultimately ordered dismissed by the Ninth Circuit Court of
       Appeals.
     * Garden State Equality v. Dow (2011–2013), New Jersey's civil unions
       violate due process guarantees; denying same-sex marriage ruled
       unconstitutional in state superior court. The N.J. Supreme Court
       refuses to stay the ruling; and ultimately the state defendants
       drop their appeal.
     * Griego v. Oliver, 316 P.3d 865 (N.M. 2013), New Mexico's
       constitutional protections require marriage to be extended to
       same-sex couples in this N.M. Supreme Court ruling.
     * State v. Schmidt, Opinion No. 6898 (Alaska, April 25, 2014), The
       Supreme Court of Alaska finds that same-sex couples, defined as
       "two people of the same biological sex who are in a long-term,
       committed, intimate domestic partnership, and who", but if for
       Alaska law, "would marry if they could" are entitled to the full
       benefit of the state's tax exemption programs.^[329]
     * Halopka-Ivery v. Walker (2014) Same-sex marriage recognition case
       where a couple married out-of-state is seeking original
       jurisdiction in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, as a matter of publici
       juris. The petition/case has been filed on April 16, 2014, and
       docketed as number 2014AP000839-OA. On May 27, 2014, the state
       supreme court, on a 5–2 vote, declined to hear the

US Supreme Court[edit]

     * Appeal from Tenth Circuit:

          Kitchen v. Herbert

                The state ban on same-sex marriage ruled unconstitutional
                in U.S. district court, 961 F. Supp. 2d 1181 (2013).
                Ruling stayed by U.S. Supreme Court until resolution of
                appeals, Herbert v. Kitchen, 134 S.Ct. 893 (January 6,
                2014). Appealed in the Tenth Circuit, case number 13-4178,
                with oral arguments held on April 10, 2014.^[333] District
                court ruling upheld, June 25, 2014; stayed pending further
                appeal.^[191] On August 5, a petition for certiorari was
                filed with the Supreme Court by the office of the state's
                Attorney General^[334] and the plaintiffs' attorneys said
                they would support the state's request.^[335]

     * Appeal from Tenth Circuit:

          Bishop v. Smith

                The state ban on same-sex marriage ruled unconstitutional
                in U.S. district court, Bishop v. Oklahoma ex rel. Holder,
                962 F. Supp. 2d 1252 (2014). Ruling stayed pending
                resolution of Kitchen v. Herbert (see below). Appeal was
                heard by the same panel of judges as Kitchen in the Tenth
                Circuit, but with separate briefing and oral argument on
                April 17, 2014, case number 14-5003 and
                14-5006.^[336]^[337] District court ruling upheld, July
                18, 2014; stayed pending further appeal.^[338]

     * Appeal from Fourth Circuit:

          Bostic v. Schaefer

                Initially filed as Bostic v. McDonnell on July 18, 2013.
                The U.S. district court found the state's ban on same-sex
                marriage unconstitutional on February 13, 2014 under both
                due process and equal protection challenges, Bostic v.
                Rainey, 970 F. Supp. 2d 456. Ruling stayed pending
                conclusion of appeal. Restyled as Bostic v. Schaefer in
                the Fourth Circuit, case number 14-1167, with oral
                arguments held on May 12, 2014. The panel hearing the case
                consisted of U.S. Circuit Judges Roger L. Gregory, Paul
                Niemeyer, and Henry F. Floyd; the judges were described as
                "sharply divided" during arguments.^[339]^[340]
                On July 28, 2014, in a 2–1 decision, the Fourth Circuit
                affirmed Bostic. The majority noted that "inertia and
                apprehension are not legitimate bases for denying same-sex
                couples due process and equal protection of the
                laws."^[341] After the ruling, North Carolina Attorney
                General Roy Cooper indicated he would no longer defend the
                ban in his state.^[342]

Third Circuit[edit]

     * Appeal from Pennsylvania, Middle District:

          Whitewood v. Wolf

                This same-sex marriage case was effectively resolved on
                May 20, 2014, when Judge John E. Jones III ruled that
                Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional,
                Whitewood v. Wolf, No. 1-13-cv-01861 (M.D. Pa.) With the
                state's governor declining to appeal, the decision went
                into effect immediately, effectively legalizing same-sex
                marriage in Pennsylvania.^[165]
                Despite this, the Schuylkill County clerk who handles
                marriage licensing in her official capacity tried to
                intervene in the case after the ruling was handed down.
                The counsel of record in the Pennsylvania county clerk's
                litigation is Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative
                Christian nonprofit organization. The county clerk sought
                to stop the same-sex marriages being held in the state, as
                well as to appeal the Whitewood ruling.^[343] On June 18,
                2014, Judge Jones denied the county clerk's motion for
                intervention and a stay, and on July 3, 2014, a
                three-judge panel of the Third Circuit summarily affirmed
                the denial. The Schuylkill clerk again applied for a stay
                of judgment, this time to U.S. Supreme Court Associate
                Justice Samuel Alito, Circuit Justice for the Third
                Circuit. Justice Alito denied the clerk's application for
                a stay on July 8, 2014, and the Third Circuit denied the
                clerk's petition to rehear her case for intervention on
                August 4, 2014.^[167]^[168]

Fifth Circuit[edit]

     * Appeal from Texas, Western District:

          De Leon v. Perry

                Same-sex marriage case filed on October 28, 2013;
                preliminary injunction granted in U.S. district court, 975
                F. Supp. 2d 632, on February 26, 2014. The court reasoned
                that: "Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on
                the merits, i.e. that [Texas'] ban on same-sex marriage is
                unconstitutional; have established that continued
                enforcement ... would cause them irreparable harm." The
                district judge issued a stay during the state's
                interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of
                Appeals, appellate case number 14-50196. On April 14,
                2014, the plaintiffs-appellees same-sex couples filed a
                motion for an expedited hearing of the appeal, with the
                state appellants in opposition but forgoing a reply. This
                motion to expedite was denied without comment on May 21,
                2014 by Circuit Judge James E. Graves,
                Jr.^[344]^[345]^[346]

Sixth Circuit[edit]

   All four states under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
   the Sixth Circuit have a same-sex marriage case currently under appeal
   in that court. Oral arguments for all the below Sixth Circuit cases
   (DeBoer,^[347] Obergefell and Henry,^[348] Bourke and Love,^[349] and
   Tanco,^[350]) were heard on August 6, 2014 at 1:00pm in Cincinnati. The
   panel hearing the cases consisted of U.S. Circuit Judges Martha
   Daughtrey, Jeffrey Sutton, and Deborah L. Cook:^[351]
     * Appeal from Michigan, Eastern District:

          DeBoer v. Snyder

                Initially filed on January 23, 2012; here, the U.S.
                district court finds that the state ban violates the Equal
                Protection Clause, 973 F. Supp. 2d 757 (E.D. Mich.).
                Permanent injunction against enforcement of same-sex
                marriage bans and implementing statutes ordered March 21,
                2014. Appeal filed in the Sixth Circuit, case number
                14-1341. Order stayed indefinitely, i.e., until appeals
                have been concluded, and expedited appeal ordered on a 2–1
                appeal panel vote. On April 8, 2014, the Sixth Circuit
                directed counsel for the same-sex couples to respond to
                the state's petition for an initial en banc hearing—only
                to deny the state's petition twenty days later, with not
                one judge in the circuit voting to bypass the normal
                procedure: a hearing by a three-judge
                panel.^[352]^[353]^[354]

     * Appeals from Ohio, Southern District:

          Obergefell marriage case

                Initially filed on July 19, 2013; here, the U.S. district
                court finds that the state ban on same-sex marriage
                violates the Due Process Clause, for the limited purpose
                of issuing death certificates, Obergefell v. Wymyslo, 962
                F. Supp. 2d 968. Under appeal in the Sixth Circuit,
                Obergefell v. Himes, case number 14-3057.

          Henry v. Himes

                This case originates in the same U.S. district court and
                before the same judge as Obergefell (see above). Here, a
                case to seek the names of same-sex parents legally married
                out-of-state on birth certificates, filed on February 10,
                2014 as Henry v. Wymyslo, was amended to overturn the
                state ban on same-sex marriage. On April 14, 2014, the
                U.S. district judge in the case declared: "The record
                before the Court, which includes the judicially noticed
                record in Obergefell, is staggeringly devoid of any
                legitimate justification for the State's ongoing arbitrary
                discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and,
                therefore, Ohio's marriage recognition bans are facially
                unconstitutional and unenforceable under any
                circumstances" (emphasis omitted). The judge noted that
                while the Due Process Clause requires that the state
                recognize out-of-state same-sex unions under his rulings,
                Ohio need not perform same-sex marriage. Except for the
                initial birth certificate amendment issue, the district
                judge stayed the remainder of the order pending appeal.
                After the state attorney general filed the necessary
                paperwork on May 9, 2014, Henry is currently on appeal in
                the Sixth Circuit, case number 14-3464.^[23]
                On May 29, 2014, the Sixth Circuit issued a sua sponte
                order consolidating both Obergefell and Henry.^[355]

     * Appeal from Kentucky, Western District:

          Bourke v. Beshear

                Initially filed on July 26, 2013; here, the U.S. district
                court found the state's refusal to recognize same-sex
                marriages from other jurisdictions unconstitutional as
                violating the Equal Protection Clause; other theories
                (i.e. Due Process violations) were therefore not analyzed.
                Order stayed during interlocutory appeal, appellate number
                14-5291.

          Love v. Beshear

                The addition of intervening plaintiffs to this lawsuit
                dealing with the related issue of denial of marriage
                licenses to in-state same-sex couples, required the court
                to bifurcate the case and restyle it. Love continued in
                district court as to the state marriage license issue,
                while the out-of-state recognition issue was appealed.
                Briefing by the intervening in-state couples concluded on
                May 28, 2014.^[356]
                On July 1, 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II
                found in favor of the intervening same-sex couple
                plaintiffs and ruled that Kentucky's ban on allowing
                same-sex marriage in-state violates the Equal Protection
                Clause. In doing so, Judge Heyburn departs from the
                opinions issued by most of the other U.S. district courts
                that examined the issue; he "does not determine whether
                Kentucky’s laws interfere with a fundamental right."
                Looking at the trio of marriage cases of Loving v.
                Virginia, Zablocki v. Redhail, and Turner v. Safley; Judge
                Heyburn states that "the question before the Court can be
                distilled to: is same-sex marriage part of or included in
                the fundamental right to marry, or is it something else
                altogether?" He is hesitant to answer in the affirmative,
                reasoning that "holding that the fundamental right to
                marry encompasses same-sex marriage would be a dramatic
                step that the Supreme Court has not yet indicated a
                willingness to take."
                Judge Heyburn then notes that he can bypass answering this
                question. "Given the current posture of relevant
                constitutional jurisprudence, this Court finds caution
                here a more appropriate approach to avoid overreaching in
                its own constitutional analysis." Instead, the judge finds
                that homosexual persons constitute a suspect class.
                Although Sixth Circuit precedent suggests that sexual
                orientation classifications do not receive heightened
                scrutiny, Heyburn prods the Sixth Circuit "to reconsider
                its view" as this precedent relied on Bowers v. Hardwick,
                a Supreme Court case subsequently overturned as "not
                correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today."
                (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 at 575) He does
                the analysis required and finds the heightened scrutiny of
                a "quasi-suspect" class applies to the case; but even
                under the lower "rational basis" review, the state does
                not bear it's burden in justifying exclusion of same-sex
                couples from marriage. Heyburn concludes that the
                defendants' arguments for exclusion, i.e. encouraging
                relationships that procreate and stabilize the birthrate,
                "are not those of serious people," finding no relation
                between same-sex marriage and heterosexual
                procreation.^[357]
                Judge Heyburn stayed his ruling pending appeal, appellate
                number 14-5818.

          Consolidation of Bourke and Love appeals

                Upon motion of appellee same-sex couples, the U.S. Sixth
                Circuit Court of Appeals consolidated Love v. Beshear with
                Bourke v. Beshear, as the cases had been previously split
                due to the in-state versus out-of-state issue. A July 16,
                2014, order by the Sixth Circuit set an expedited briefing
                schedule in the consolidated appeal due to conclude July
                31; oral arguments remain the same as in the
                previously-scheduled Bourke – August 6, 2014.^[358] The
                Sixth Circuit will also hear same-sex marriage cases
                stemming from Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee on that date
                as well.

     * Appeal from Tennessee, Middle District:

          Tanco v. Haslam

                Initially filed on October 21, 2013; here, the U.S.
                district court granted a preliminary injunction on March
                14, 2014, with the court finding the equal protection
                analysis in Bourke (see above) persuasive. The injunction
                forces Tennessee to recognize the three plaintiff same-sex
                couples' out-of-state marriages until the court disposes
                of the case; it also indicates that the couples are likely
                to succeed on the merits of their case. The district judge
                denied Tennessee's motion to stay the injunction,
                reasoning that unlike Kitchen v. Herbert (where the U.S.
                Supreme Court granted a stay) this injunction covers only
                three couples and not the entire state. The Sixth Circuit
                finally granted a stay at the request of the state
                defendants, at the same time, sua sponte, ordering
                expedited assignment to a panel of judges for
                consideration on the merits. Appellate case number
                14-5297.^[359]

Seventh Circuit[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in the Seventh Circuit

   On September 4, 2014 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
   district court rulings striking down same-sex marriage bans in the
   states of Indiana, and Wisconsin.^[360]^[361]^[362] The four same-sex
   marriage cases pending before the Seventh Circuit (Baskin, Fujii, Lee,
   and Walker v. Wolf) were consolidated for an expedited oral argument
   per a July 14, 2014 court order. Oral arguments took place August 26,
   2014 in Chicago.^[363] The panel hearing the cases consisted of U.S.
   Circuit Judges Richard Posner, Ann Claire Williams, and David
   Hamilton:^[364]
     * Appeal from Indiana, Southern District:

          Baskin v. Bogan
          Fujii v. Commissioner of the Ind. State Dept. of Revenue
          Lee v. Abbott

                Five separate same-sex marriage lawsuits were filed in the
                U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana:
                Love v. Pence, docket number 4:14-CV-0015, filed on March
                7, 2014; Baskin v. Bogan, docket number 1:14-CV-0355,
                filed on March 13, 2014; and Fujii v. Pence, Bowling v.
                Pence and Lee v. Pence, dockets 1:14-CV-0404, -0405, and
                -0406 respectively, all filed on March 14.^[365]
                Baskin v. Bogan took precedence, because one partner of
                one of the plaintiff couples is terminally ill. As to this
                one couple, the district court granted immediate relief:
                on April 10, 2014, an emergency order—then after oral
                arguments on May 8, 2014 on a motion for summary judgment,
                a preliminary injunction—directing Indiana to recognize
                the couple's out-of-state same-sex marriage. In doing so,
                the court temporarily withdrew the motion for as to the
                rest of the plaintiffs, reasoning it makes a stronger case
                for the terminally ill couple while also allowing the rest
                a resolution on the merits without causing undue confusion
                in case of an appeal. The state did file an appeal of this
                limited injunction on May 9, 2014; this portion of the
                case, to briefed in the U.S. Seventh Circuit under the
                name of Baskin v. Zoeller, appellate docket 14-2037, was
                dismissed by the latter court as moot on July 14, 2014.
                Both parties jointly agreed to a dismissal of this
                interlocutory appeal, as the Baskin plaintiffs have since
                received a favorable final ruling in district court, and
                the Seventh Circuit will be reviewing that
                ruling.^[366]^[367]^[368]
                On June 25, 2014, the U.S. district court ruled as to the
                case of the remaining plaintiffs in Baskin, as well as the
                cases of Fujii and Lee. District Judge Richard L. Young
                found in favor of the plaintiff couples, granting them
                summary judgment and striking down Indiana's ban on
                same-sex marriage, while removing the state's governor
                from the lawsuit. In doing so, the judge found that the
                ban violated the Fourteenth Amendment under both due
                process and equal protection theories; the state had no
                rational basis for instituting such ban:

     Defendants point to the one extremely limited difference between
     opposite-sex and same-sex couples, the ability of the couple to
     naturally and unintentionally procreate, as justification to deny
     same-sex couples a vast array of rights. The connection between
     these rights and responsibilities and the ability to conceive
     unintentionally is too attenuated to support such a broad
     prohibition.

                The district court did not immediately issue a stay in
                Baskin v. Bogan and two companion cases.^[369] Judge Young
                also dismissed Love v. Pence for lack of subject-matter
                jurisdiction because, in that case, the only named
                defendant was Indiana Governor Mike Pence, and "...the
                injuries of which the Plaintiffs complain are not fairly
                traceable to him, and cannot be redressed by him"; the
                governor cannot "issue executive decrees telling other
                elected officials how to do their jobs when it comes to
                laws affecting marriage."^[370]
                The state defendants appealed the U.S. District Court's
                decisions in Baskin v. Bogan, Fujii, and Lee; and on June
                27, 2014, the cases were ordered, sua sponte, consolidated
                for purposes of briefing and disposition by the Seventh
                Circuit, and docketed under appellate case numbers
                14-2386, 14-2387, and 14-2388 respectively. On the same
                day, a three-judge panel (Richard Posner, Ann Claire
                Williams, and David F. Hamilton) of the Seventh Circuit
                granted an emergency stay of the prevailing same-sex
                marriage cases for the duration of their appeal; a
                separate order exempted one marriage, because one partner
                is terminally ill, from that stay on recognition. The
                briefing schedule was set as to end on September 19, 2014;
                however, after Wolf v. Walker (see below) was decided and
                appealed to the same circuit, the cases were ordered
                combined for oral argument.^[371]^[372]

     * Appeal from Wisconsin, Western District:

          Wolf v. Walker

                Same-sex marriage case with U.S. district judge Barbara
                Crabb granting plaintiff same-sex couples' motion for
                summary judgement on June 6, 2014. Judge Crabb found that
                Wisconsin's constitutional and legislative ban on same-sex
                marriage interferes with the fundamental right to
                marriage, violating the plaintiffs' due process and equal
                protection rights:

     "In light of Windsor and the many decisions that have invalidated
     restrictions on same-sex marriage since Windsor, it appears that
     courts are moving toward a consensus that it is time to embrace full
     legal equality for gay and lesbian citizens. Perhaps it is no
     coincidence that these decisions are coming at a time when public
     opinion is moving quickly in the direction of support for same-sex
     marriage."

                The judge held that heightened scrutiny applied to Wolf,
                No. 14-cv-64. While a hearing on specific injunctive
                relief was to follow (and did), clerks in at least 60
                counties had begun marrying same-sex couples based on the
                judge's declaratory judgement alone. The state attorney
                general immediately requested a stay from both the
                district judge and from the Court of Appeals.^[373]
                In a June 9, 2014 order, Judge Crabb denied a motion for
                an emergency stay by the state defendants. The judge
                reasoned as she had not yet issued an injunction, only a
                declaration, that: "defendants [are] unable to cite any
                authority for the proposition that a court may 'stay' a
                declaration." As to the fact that clerks were already
                issuing marriage licenses, she responded: "...that is an
                issue outside the scope of this case." The organization
                representing the plaintiffs has submitted proposed
                language for the injunction. The state attorney general,
                while requesting that the court "expedite its ruling and
                enter final judgment without further hearing or oral
                argument," has filed an objection to it. On one hand, the
                attorney general states the proposed injunction "is not
                sufficiently specific" and "hopelessly vague," and on the
                other hand, objects to it as "expansive in scope" and
                describes it as "judicial legislation."^[374]^[375]
                Judge Crabb held a hearing on June 13, 2014, where she
                adopted the injunction proposed by the plaintiffs, for the
                most part, rewording it somewhat to address the concerns
                of vagueness by the state defendants. She stayed "all
                relief in this case," meaning the injunction and
                declaration (despite her previous finding that defendants
                could not cite authority to stay a declaration); this
                effectively ended same-sex marriage even under county
                clerks' own volition in Wisconsin, pending appeal. The
                judge expressed that she was bound by Supreme Court
                precedent to enter the stay:

     After seeing the expressions of joy on the faces of so many newly
     wedded couples featured in media reports, I find it difficult to
     impose a stay on the event that is responsible for eliciting that
     emotion, even if the stay is only temporary. Same-sex couples have
     waited many years to receive equal treatment under the law, so it is
     understandable that they do not want to wait any longer.^[376]

                The state defendants filed a notice of appeal on July 10,
                2014 and the case was decided sub nom., Walker v. Wolf,
                appellate case number 14-2526. The Seventh Circuit
                consolidated Wolf with the Baskin marriage cases (see
                above) for oral arguments on August 26, 2014, and ruled
                the state laws unconstitutional on September 4, 2014.

   On September 9, 2014 Wisconsin (joint by Indiana) asked the U.S.
   Supreme Court to uphold their respective bans on gay marriage. The move
   comes after the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
   last week that both state bans were invalid.The new petitions mean
   there are now gay marriage cases concerning five states pending at the
   high court. The others are Virginia, Utah and Oklahoma. ^[377]

Ninth Circuit[edit]

   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments in
   Jackson v. Fuddy, Sevcik v. Sandoval, and Latta v. Otter on September
   8, 2014 in San Francisco. The panel hearing the cases consisted of U.S.
   Circuit Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Ronald M. Gould, and Marsha S.
   Berzon:^[378]

   In September 2014, The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
   Francisco reviewed whether judges in Nevada, Idaho, and Hawaii were
   correct to uphold those states' gay marriage bans. Hawaii's legislature
   subsequently voted to allow same-sex nuptials, while a federal judge
   struck down Idaho's gay marriage prohibition. Judge Gould on the panel
   voted previously in favor of same-sex marriages, together with judge
   Berzon and Reinhardt. Gould said the 9th Circuit is bound to apply
   those heightened constitutional protections to the gay marriage
   debate.^[379]
     * Appeal from Hawaii, District:

          Jackson v. Fuddy

                U.S. district court upholds the state's denial of marriage
                to same sex couples, Jackson v. Abercrombie, 884 F. Supp.
                2d 1065 (D. Haw. 2012). As this was a pre-Windsor case,
                the court found Baker as controlling, and rejected
                plaintiffs' due process and equal protection claims. On
                appeal to the Ninth Circuit, case number 12-16995.
                Briefing, including on the mootness issue, to be concluded
                on June 10, 2014. Per letter dated May 6, 2014, the state
                attorney general is choosing not to file any brief or
                defend the case any longer, stating that the law has
                changed since the case's filing—i.e. Hawaii has enacted
                same-sex marriage legislatively and the Ninth Circuit now
                applies heightened scrutiny to cases of discrimination
                based on a person's sexual
                orientation.^[380]^[381]^[382]^[383] On July 3, 2014, the
                Ninth Circuit scheduled oral arguments in Jackson; the
                issues presented are whether the appeal is moot, and if
                so, whether the opinion below (upholding Hawaii's ban) is
                subject to vacatur.^[384]

     * Appeal from Nevada, District:

          Sevcik v. Sandoval

                U.S. district court upholds the state's denial of marriage
                to same sex couples, 911 F. Supp. 2d 996 (D. Nev. 2012).
                Ruling appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
                case number 12-17668. The district judge found that any
                challenges are precluded by Baker, and if not, the
                discrimination described merits only rational basis
                review, and that "the protection of the traditional
                institution of marriage ... is a legitimate state
                interest." As this case was decided before Windsor, and
                since the lower rational basis review in sexual
                orientation discrimination cases is no longer valid law in
                the Ninth Circuit, Nevada has decided to no longer defend
                this case.^[385]^[386] On July 3, 2014, the Ninth Circuit
                scheduled oral arguments in Sevcik. If the district court
                ruling upholding Nevada's same-sex marriage ban is
                reversed, the Circuit Court could simply vacate the ruling
                below, or could rule more broadly, allowing same-sex
                marriage statewide, or possibly circuit-wide.^[387]

     * Appeal from Idaho, District:

          Latta v. Otter

                U.S. district court strikes down the state ban against
                same-sex marriage, No. 1:13-CV-00492-CWD (D. Ida. May 13,
                2014). Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Dale ruled that
                Idaho's marriage laws' exclusion of same-sex couples were
                unconstitutional, stating:

     Idaho's Marriage Laws withhold from them a profound and personal
     choice, one that most can take for granted. By doing so, Idaho's
     Marriage Laws deny same-sex couples the economic, practical,
     emotional, and spiritual benefits of marriage, relegating each
     couple to a stigmatized, second-class status. Plaintiffs suffer
     these injuries not because they are unqualified to marry, start a
     family, or grow old together, but because of who they are and whom
     they love.

                The ruling was appealed to the Ninth Circuit; on May 15,
                2014, a three-judge panel issued a temporary stay. A May
                20, 2014 order determined that a stay pending appeal is
                necessary, with one circuit judge concurring with the
                stay, "...solely because I believe that the Supreme Court,
                in Herbert v. Kitchen ... has virtually instructed courts
                of appeals to grant stays in the circumstances before us
                today. If we were writing on a cleaner state, I would
                conclude that application of the familiar factors ...
                counsels against the stay requested by the Idaho
                appellants." The Ninth Circuit calendared the cases,
                numbers 14-35420 and 14-35421, for the week of September
                8, 2014.^[160]^[388]^[389]
                On May 30, 2014, state defendants filed a petition before
                the Ninth Circuit to hear the case initially en banc,
                which in that circuit means a hearing by an 11-judge panel
                instead of a 3-judge panel. Idaho maintains that any
                ruling "will carry profound legal and broader social
                consequences" and a ruling signed off by more judges will
                hold greater weight. The state also argues that there is a
                circuit split in the U.S. Courts of Appeals in the level
                of scrutiny used when deciding cases of discrimination
                based on sexual orientation—plaintiffs will argue
                heightened scrutiny, which stems from the Ninth Circuit
                decision in SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740
                F.3d 471 (2014); the other circuits apply less scrutiny,
                called rational basis review.^[390] On August 19, 2014,
                the state's petition for an initial en banc hearing was
                formally denied by the Ninth Circuit.^[391]
                On July 3, 2014, the Ninth Circuit scheduled oral
                arguments in Latta. Jackson v. Fuddy and Sevcik v.
                Sandoval—two other cases pending before the same circuit,
                see above—are also scheduled for argument at the same
                time. Such scheduling indicates a broad ruling on same-sex
                marriage by the Ninth Circuit is possible.^[392]

     * Appeal from Oregon, District:

          Geiger v. Kitzhaber and
          Rummell v. Kitzhaber

                Two state same-sex marriage cases, consolidated in U.S.
                district court. The court heard oral argument on motions
                for summary judgment in both on April 23, 2014. Three
                weeks later, an organization that opposes same-sex
                marriage argued for, and was denied, status to intervene
                in the case. On May 19, 2014, the U.S. district judge
                declared Oregon's same-sex marriage ban unenforceable, No.
                6:13-cv-01834-MC (D. Or.) He immediately ordered a
                permanent injunction preventing state defendants from
                enforcing or applying any law to prevent same-sex couples
                from marrying, or from having their out-of-state marriage
                recognized. The same-sex opposition group immediately
                applied for a stay, and was denied, by the Ninth Circuit.
                This group is appealing the ruling as well, with the
                plaintiffs and state defendants moving on May 20, 2014, to
                dismiss the appeal as moot, appellate number 14-35427
                (U.S. 9th Cir.) On May 27, 2014, this same-sex opposition
                group filed an application for a stay with the U.S.
                Supreme Court, National Organization of Marriage, Inc. v.
                Geiger, No. 13A1173 (U.S. Sup. Ct.) The next day, Justice
                Anthony Kennedy, responsible for applications coming from
                the Ninth Circuit, asked the Geiger plaintiffs to submit a
                reply to this application by June 2,
                2014.^[393]^[394]^[395]^[396]^[397]^[398]
                On June 4, 2014, in an order without comment, the U.S.
                Supreme Court denied to stay the U.S. district judge's
                decision, removing the last obstacle in the Geiger and
                Rummell cases; a motion to dismiss the opposition group's
                appeal as untimely and without foundation, awaiting a
                decision the Ninth Circuit, will finalize the decision if
                granted.^[399]

Tenth Circuit[edit]

   Main article: Same-sex marriage in the Tenth Circuit
     * Appeal from Colorado, District:

          Burns v. Hickenlooper

                This is an appeal of a same-sex marriage case filed on
                July 1, 2014 in U.S. district court. The complaint, which
                references the Tenth Circuit decision in Kitchen v.
                Herbert, (see above), sues for a civil rights claim under
                42 U.S.C. § 1983, and alleges that the defendants violate
                the Fourteenth Amendment by denying plaintiffs the
                fundamental right of marriage.^[400] The main defendants,
                the state governor and attorney general, agree with the
                plaintiffs insofar as having the court issue an injunction
                declaring the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, but
                they want a stay and swift resolution by the U.S. Supreme
                Court in order to avoid costly litigation.^[401]
                On July 15, 2014, a expedited status conference was held
                in the case before U.S. District Judge Raymond P. Moore.
                As the defendants stipulate that the Colorado same-sex
                marriage ban cannot stand, the only issue before the court
                is the state's request for a stay of the injunction to be
                issued against the ban. Per courtroom minutes, the judge
                scheduled a hearing on the state's motion for July 22,
                2014.^[402]^[403]^[404]
                Judge Moore granted a preliminary injunction on July 23,
                2014; this prevents Colorado officials from enforcing the
                state's same-sex marriage ban as the judge found it
                unconstitutional under the plaintiffs' theory. Moore
                issued a stay in the case as to proceedings (i.e. the
                injunction is preliminary); this expires upon the issuance
                of a mandate in Kitchen v. Herbert. Refusing to "divine"
                Supreme Court logic in staying other same-sex marriage
                cases, Judge Moore declined to stay the injunction, though
                he issued a temporary stay until August 25, 2014 to allow
                an appeal.^[405]
                The state defendants immediately filed a notice of appeal;
                the case is now before the Tenth Circuit, where defendants
                are expected to seek a permanent stay of the
                decision.^[406]

Eleventh Circuit[edit]

     * Appeal from Florida, Northern District: Brenner v. Scott

                Same-sex marriage cases Brenner v. Scott and Grimsley v.
                Scott consolidated on April 21, 2014 for case-management
                purposes. On August 21, 2014, the state's constitutional
                and statutory bans on same-sex marriage was found to
                violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of
                the Fourteenth Amendment. U.S. District Judge Robert Lewis
                Hinkle granted the same-sex couple plaintiffs' motion for
                a preliminary injunction that prevents Florida from
                enforcing its bans; however, the judge issued a stay as to
                the injunction.^[407]^[408]^[409]^[410]

Federal district courts[edit]

     * Alabama, Southern District: Searcy v. Bentley

                This same-sex marriage recognition case was filed on May
                7, 2014. Plaintiffs seek recognition of their out-of-state
                marriage and step-parent adoption for their minor
                daughter. In mid-June, attorneys for the same-sex couple
                have filed a motion for summary judgement; the state
                defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.^[411]

     * Alabama, Middle District: Hard v. Bentley

                This same-sex marriage recognition case was filed on
                February 13, 2014.^[412] Here, the plaintiff is asking to
                be listed on his deceased partner's death certificate as
                surviving spouse, a claim similar to the one in Obergefell
                (see above).

     * Alabama, Northern District: Aaron-Brush v. Bentley

                This same-sex marriage recognition case was filed on June
                10, 2014. Here, the plaintiff couple, married
                out-of-state, seek recognition of this marriage and the
                state benefits associated with such.^[413]

     * Alaska, District: Hamby v. Parnell

                This same-sex marriage case was filed in Anchorage on May
                12, 2014.^[414] A scheduling conference in the case was
                held on July 11, 2014; with Hamby to proposed to proceed
                as follows: expert reports due on or before October 1,
                2014; pretrial motions to be filed by October 1, 2014; and
                discovery to be completed by January 5, 2015. Parties
                indicated that a trial is not necessary for disposition of
                Hamby—the case will be resolved by a motion for summary
                judgment.^[415]

     * Arizona, District: Connolly v. Roche and Majors v. Humble

                In Connolly, plaintiff same-sex couples filed their motion
                for summary judgment on April 29, 2014; per court order
                briefing by parties on this motion will conclude on June
                23.^[416] The motion to consolidate Majors v. Humble
                (formerly known as Majors v. Horne) with Connolly was
                denied on April 15, 2014, but "because [the cases] turn on
                the same ultimate issue," both cases were assigned to the
                same judge, the visiting Senior U.S. District Judge John
                W. Sedwick.^[417]
                On July 7, 2014, plaintiffs and defendants filed a joint
                status report to Judge Sedwick indicating that it would be
                best to resolve Majors via summary judgment, a method not
                requiring trial, as well, as both parties stipulate there
                is no issue as to any material facts. The proposed
                schedule is as follows: plaintiffs will file a motion for
                summary judgment and a supporting brief by August 1, 2014
                and the defendants will respond by September 5. Majors
                will then move forward pending the outcome of the Ninth
                Circuit decision in the same-sex marriage cases of Latta,
                Sevcik, and Jackson;^[418] the Ninth Circuit has scheduled
                these latter cases (which could become circuit precedent)
                for oral argument on September 8, 2014. On July 15, 2014,
                Judge Sedwick agreed with the parties' joint
                recommendation for summary judgment and briefing schedule,
                and adopted such via court order.^[419]

     * Arkansas, Eastern District: Jernigan v. Crane

                Same-sex marriage case filed in Little Rock on July 15,
                2013. A hearing on the state defendants' January 21, 2014,
                motion to dismiss has yet to be scheduled. On July 16,
                2014 attorneys for the plaintiffs asked for a summary
                judgement of the case.^[420]^[421]

     * Georgia, Northern District: Inniss v. Aderhold

                Same-sex marriage class-action lawsuit filed on April 22,
                2014 in Atlanta.^[422]

     * Louisiana, Eastern District: Forum for Equality Louisiana v.
       Barfield

                First filed as an out-of-state same-sex marriage
                recognition case on February 12, 2014, Forum for Equality
                Louisiana was joined with an earlier case, Robicheaux v.
                George. Robicheaux was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,
                as it named the incorrect defendant. All briefs on a
                motion for summary judgment were due May 12, 2014. Oral
                arguments were held on June 25, 2014 before U.S. District
                Judge Martin Feldman sitting in New Orleans. Judge Feldman
                indicated that he prefers a ruling on more aspects of
                same-sex marriage: he scheduled further briefing, due
                before July 16, 2014, on related issues—including whether
                Louisiana's refusal to allow in-state same-sex
                marriage—violates the plaintiffs' rights to due process
                and equal protection.^[423]
                On September 3, 2014, Judge Feldman ruled against the
                plaintiffs, upholding Louisiana's ban on same-sex
                marriage.^[424] The plaintiffs are planning to appeal the
                decision to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.^[425]

     * Michigan, Eastern District: Blankenship v. Snyder

                Two women married in New York want the court to order
                Michigan to recognize their marriage to allow the
                second-parent adoption of their children–one adopted, the
                other conceived via in vitro fertilization. Their
                complaint was filed on June 5, 2014; they had previously
                sought to intervene in DeBoer v. Snyder, another Michigan
                case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth
                Circuit.^[426]

     * Missouri, District: Lawson and Dahlgren v. Kelly

                Lawson is a same-sex marriage case filed by the ACLU first
                in the state circuit court, the Sixteenth Judicial
                District, on June 24, 2014. Lawson alleges Missouri's
                same-sex marriage ban violates the Equal Protection and
                Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.^[427] The
                case was later moved to federal court and assigned to
                District Judge Ortrie Smith after Missouri Attorney
                General Chris Koster intervened.^[428]

     * Montana, District: Ronaldo v. Fox

                Same-sex marriage case filed in Great Falls on May 21,
                2014.^[429]

     * North Carolina, Middle District: Fisher-Borne v. Smith

                Originally a case dealing with second-parent adoption
                filed in 2012; proceedings were initially stayed pending a
                decision in Windsor, after which this case was amended to
                allow consideration of same-sex marriage. On June 2, 2014,
                a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing the case recommended
                another stay pending a decision by the Fourth Circuit
                Court of Appeals in Bostic v. Shaefer.^[430] Similar
                orders have been entered in other Fourth Circuit cases,
                including McGee v. Cole, Bradacs v. Haley, and Harris v.
                Rainey. On July 28, 2014, following the ruling by the
                Fourth Circuit of Appeals that the same-sex marriage ban
                in Virginia is unconstitutional, North Carolina attorney
                general Roy Cooper announced he would stop defending the
                same-sex marriage ban in North Carolina.^[431]^[432]

     * North Dakota, District: Ramsay v. Dalrymple

                On June 6, 2014, private counsel filed a lawsuit in U.S.
                District Court in North Dakota on behalf of seven same-sex
                couples challenging the state’s ban on same-sex
                marriage.^[433]

     * Pennsylvania, Eastern District: Palladino v. Corbett

                Same-sex marriage case filed in Philadelphia on August 28,
                2013. The judge is currently ruling on pretrial motions,
                with oral arguments scheduled on May 28, 2014. This case
                may be moot, however, since Whitewood v. Wolf, another
                Pennsylvania marriage case, may have decided the issue.

     * Puerto Rico, District: Conde v. Rius

                Same-sex marriage lawsuit filed in San Juan in late March
                2014.^[434]

     * South Carolina, District: Bradacs v. Haley

                On April 22, 2014, proceedings in this same-sex marriage
                case were stayed until the expected ruling in Bostic v.
                Shaefer, a precedent-setting case above in the U.S. Fourth
                Circuit Court of Appeals. Proceedings have been stayed for
                similar reasons in other Fourth Circuit cases: Harris v.
                Rainey, McGee v. Cole, and Fisher-Borne v. Smith.

     * South Dakota, District: Rosenbrahn v. Daugaard

                Same-sex marriage lawsuit filed on May 22, 2014 in Sioux
                Falls. Five plaintiff couples have valid out-of state
                marriages, and a sixth was denied a license in-state. On
                July 3, an attorney for the plaintiffs filed a motion for
                summary judgment, such a motion allows the court to rule
                on the case without a trial, where there is no issue as to
                the material facts. The attorney also filed a motion to
                allow the National Council for Lesbian Rights, a nonprofit
                LGBT advocacy organization, intervenor status in the
                case.^[435]^[436]

     * Virginia, Western District: Harris class-action

                A second Virginia case dealing with same-sex marriage;
                this was certified as a class-action lawsuit on January
                31, 2014. Two months later, proceedings were ordered
                stayed in Harris because Bostic v. Shaefer, the other
                Virginia case awaiting a decision in the U.S. Fourth
                Circuit Court of Appeals, could set precedent for that
                circuit. The plaintiff same-sex couples in this case have
                been granted leave to intervene in Bostic as well. Similar
                orders have been entered at least in three other cases
                bound by the Fourth Circuit: McGee v. Cole, Bradacs v.
                Haley, and Fisher-Borne v. Smith.^[437]^[438]

     * West Virginia, Southern District: McGee v. Cole

                This same-sex marriage case, initially filed on October 1,
                2013, survived a motion to dismiss in U.S. district court
                on January 29, 2014, with the court finding: "Doctrinal
                developments since Baker, however, do justify a finding
                that Baker is nonbinding."^[439]
                On June 10, 2014, the district court ordered a stay of
                proceedings until there is a ruling in Bostic v. Shaefer.
                Bostic is a same-sex marriage case above in the U.S.
                Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals; the district judge
                reasoned that "because of the overlap in the issues
                present" the Bostic case should be decided first.^[440]
                Similar orders exist in three other cases in states where
                U.S. district courts are bound by Fourth Circuit
                precedent: Harris v. Rainey (Virginia), Bradacs v. Haley,
                (South Carolina) and Fisher-Borne v. Smith (North
                Carolina).

State courts[edit]

   Note: In the United States, the name of the court where a civil
   complaint or a petition is initially filed, and the trial is held,
   varies by state. The following terms may be used: county court, circuit
   court, district court, and superior court.
     * Arkansas: Wright v. Arkansas

                Same-sex marriage case on appeal from state circuit court.
                Following oral arguments on a motion for summary judgment,
                held on April 17, 2014, the circuit judge issued a ruling
                on May 9, 2014, striking down the state's same-sex
                marriage ban. He stated: "The exclusion of same-sex
                couples from marriage for no rational basis violates the
                fundamental right to privacy and equal protection ... The
                difference between opposite-sex and same-sex families is
                within the privacy of their homes." Wright, No.
                60CV-13-2662 (Ark. Cir. Ct., Pulaski Co.)^[441]^[442]
                The next day the state filed notice of appeal with the
                circuit court. The state attorney general and, separately,
                the clerks of four counties, filed a petition for an
                emergency stay, and an expedited motion for a stay
                (respectively) with the state supreme court, as the trial
                judge did not act on such below. The plaintiffs-appellees
                filed their response on May 13, 2014, and later that day,
                moved to dismiss the state's appeal as premature, stating
                first, that there is no final ruling from the circuit
                court on injunctive relief, only a declaratory judgment,
                and second, that the ruling struck down the state
                constitutional ban without mentioning the statutory ban.
                The supreme court agreed with the plaintiffs, and sent the
                case back to circuit court for a final order, Wright v.
                Smith, No. CV-14-414 (Ark. Sup. Ct.)^[443]
                On May 15, 2014 the circuit judge clarified his order,
                striking down the statutory ban as well. This had the
                brief effect of allowing same-sex marriage to resume.
                However, the next day the Arkansas Supreme Court acted on
                the state's and county clerks' renewed motions for a stay,
                granting them, Smith v. Wright, No. CV-14-427 (Ark. Sup.
                Ct.) The case is currently on appeal.^[444]^[445]

     * Colorado: Brinkman v. Long, McDaniel-Miccio v. Hickenlooper, and
       Colorado ex rel. Suthers v. Hall

                Here, the same-sex marriage cases of Brinkman and
                McDaniel-Miccio were combined for argument in the state's
                Seventeenth Judicial District via a granted motion to
                consolidate. After written motions for summary judgment
                were submitted and a court hearing was held, District
                Judge Scott Crabtree issued a ruling striking down
                Colorado's same-sex marriage ban. He held that the ban
                violates plaintiffs' guarantees of equal protection and
                due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.
                Constitution.^[446]
                Meanwhile, the Boulder County clerk had been issuing
                licenses based on her own interpretation of the Tenth
                Circuit ruling in Kitchen. The state attorney general
                filed a motion before the Twentieth Judicial District in
                an attempt to stay the clerk's actions. However, on July
                10, 2014 (a day after the Brinkman ruling) District Judge
                Andrew Hartman found that while the Boulder clerk violated
                the law, he refused to impose a restraining order or
                injunction upon her, as the state did not meet its high
                burden for a stay.^[447]^[448]

                After Judge Hartman's decision was handed down, Denver
                County and Pueblo County began issuing licenses to couples
                regardless of gender as well. The state's attorney general
                appealed Judge Crabtree's ruling to the Colorado Supreme
                Court. In a separate filing, and seeking a reversal of
                Judge Hartman's ruling, the attorney general also asked
                the high court for an emergency injunction to stop clerks
                from issuing licenses.^[449]^[450] In a July 18, 2014
                unanimous order issued en banc, the high court rejected
                the attorney general's request for an emergency
                injunction—one which would have statewide effect. However,
                the state supreme court ordered clerks in Adams and Denver
                counties stop issuing licenses as they were subject to a
                previous stay.^[451] The state defendants appealed Judge
                Hartman's ruling allowing the Boulder County clerk to
                issue marriage licenses despite the ban, and also asked
                Judge Hartman to reconsider his ruling and stay it.^[452]
                On July 23, 2014, Hartman denied the request, and the next
                day the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed.^[453]

                Meanwhile, the Colorado Supreme Court is scheduled to hear
                oral arguments regarding the merits of the state's
                same-sex marriage ban on September 30, 2014^[404]

                On July 29, 2014 Colorado Supreme Court ordered Boulder
                County to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex
                couples while it considers the state's appeal. Clerks in
                Pueblo County have also stopped issuing marriage license
                to same-sex couples as well.^[181]

     * Florida: Pareto v. Ruvin and Huntsman v. Heavilin

                Pareto v. Ruvin and Huntsman v. Heavilin are two state
                circuit court (i.e. trial-level) cases where Florida's ban
                on same-sex marriage has been found unconstitutional. Both
                decisions have been stayed and both are under appeal to
                the state Third District Court of Appeal. Once the appeals
                court hands down it's decision, it will be applicable
                statewide, i.e. binding upon all of the circuit and county
                courts within the State of Florida, see Pardo v. State,
                596 So.2d 665 (Fla. 1992).

     * Kansas: Nelson v. Kan. Dep't of Revenue

                Same-sex marriage recognition case filed in state district
                court in Topeka, where the plaintiffs are seeking respect
                for their out-of-state marriage licenses in-state for the
                purpose of filing their taxes as a married couple.^[454]
                The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the revenue
                department to allow the couples to file joint income tax
                returns as married. Docketed as No. 13-C-1465 (Kan. Dist.
                Ct., Shawnee Co., Div. 7)^[455]^[456]

     * Mississippi: Czekala-Chatham v. Melancon

                Same-sex divorce case; dismissed for lack of jurisdiction
                on December 2, 2013 (Chancery Ct. Dist. 3). Appeal filed
                three weeks later in state appellate court; briefing was
                scheduled to conclude July 23, 2014.

     * Missouri: Barrier v. Vasterling

                Barrier is a same-sex marriage recognition case filed by
                the ACLU in state circuit court on February 11, 2014. The
                case was docketed No. 1416-CV03892 and an April 24, 2014
                case conference set oral arguments on motions for summary
                judgment to September 25, 2014 before Judge James D.
                Youngs in Kansas City, Missouri.^[457]

     * Nebraska Nichols v. Nichols

                Same-sex divorce case filed in 2009; dismissed for lack of
                jurisdiction in August 2013. A petition for the case to be
                heard directly in the Nebraska Supreme Court was granted
                in March 2014. Oral arguments in the case, number
                S-13-0841, were heard before the state's highest court in
                Lincoln on May 28, 2014.^[458]^[459] On June 13, 2014 the
                Nebraska Supreme Court dismissed the appeal saying it did
                not have jurisdiction, as the district court never issued
                a final order (Nichols, 288 Neb. 339). The trial judge and
                plaintiff are discussing the possibility of entering a
                proper final order, which could then be appealed.^[460]

     * Pennsylvania: Commonwealth v. Haines

                This same-sex marriage case remains on appeal before the
                state supreme court, docket number 77 MAP 2013 (Pa. Sup.
                Ct.) Cases below are Ballen v. Wolf, number 481 MD 2013,
                and Cucinotta v. Commonwealth, number 451 MD 2013. On May
                21, 2014, the Middle District of Pennsylvania's ruling in
                Whitewood v. Wolf effectively legalized same-sex marriage
                in the state. The state defendants filed an application
                two days later to dismiss the Ballen and Cucinotta cases
                as moot because of this. The arguments that were set in
                these cases before the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court
                sitting en banc in June were cancelled by a May 29 court
                order as well.
                However, since Whitewood remains subject to appeal by a
                possible intervenor, the Commonwealth Court issued per

     * Texas: In re Marriage of J.B. and H.B.

                A 2009 same-sex divorce case before the state supreme
                court. A state district court granted the divorce and
                ruled the state same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional as
                applied to the case. The state court of appeals reversed,
                holding that district courts do not have jurisdiction in
                such matters, 326 S.W.3d 654 (Tex. 5th Ct. App. 2010). The
                high court granted review on August 23, 2013, and oral
                arguments were held on November 5, 2013. A decision is yet
                to be handed down.

     * Texas: In re State of Texas

                Another Texas same-sex divorce case; this is a newer case,
                however. Here, the same-sex plaintiff prevailed in the
                initial hearing, but after the state intervened on appeal,
                the appellate court directed the district court to vacate
                the initial order. On April 22, 2014, the state challenged
                the district court's statutory jurisdiction to hear
                same-sex divorce cases. The state district court not only
                found that it had jurisdiction over the case, but the
                judge also ruled that Texas's same-sex marriage ban is
                unconstitutional on its face, A.L.F.L. v. K.L.L., No.
                2014-CI-02421 (Tex. 438th Jud. Dist. Ct.)^[463]
                Before a hearing for the plaintiff same-sex divorcees'
                request for divorce could be scheduled, the state filed a
                mandamus proceeding in state appellate court. The
                appellate court granted an emergency stay on April 24, and
                directed parties to file briefs on the issue, No.
                04-14-00282-CV (Tex. 4th Ct. App.)^[464]
                On May 28, 2014, in a 2–1 decision, the appellate court
                found that procedural error was committed, and sent the
                case back. Since "the parties and the court failed to
                provide notice to the attorney general of a party’s
                challenges to the constitutionality of a state statute as
                required by the Texas Government Code," that the trial
                court would have to vacate it's April 22 order and to
                provide notice to the attorney general. The dissent,
                relying on the precedent of Ex parte Lo, 424 S.W.3d 10, 29
                (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (op. on reh’g), stated that such a
                "provide notice to the attorney general" requirement
                violates the separation of powers. The majority dismisses
                Lo as applicable to only criminal cases.^[465]^[466]
                The case now either heads back before the trial judge in
                circuit court, or can be appealed to the Texas Supreme
                Court.

     * Wyoming: Courage v. Wyoming

                Same-sex marriage case filed in state district court at
                Laramie on March 5, 2014, Docket 182 No. 262. The
                plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on July 1,
                2014, asking the court to rule without a trial as there is
                no material dispute as to the facts in the case.
