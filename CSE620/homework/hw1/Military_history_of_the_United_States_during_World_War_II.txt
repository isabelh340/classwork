   The military history of the United States' involvement in World War II
   covers the war against Japan, Germany and Italy starting with the
   December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. During the first two years of
   the global conflict, the United States had maintained formal
   neutrality, while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with
   war material through Lend-Lease which was signed into law on March 11,
   1941, as well as deploying the U.S. military to replace the British
   invasion forces in Iceland (for early U.S. combat activity in the
   Pacific Theater, see the Flying Tigers). During the war, over 16
   million Americans served in the United States Armed Forces, with
   290,000 killed in action and 670,000 wounded.^[1] There were also
   130,201 American POWs, of whom 116,129 returned home after the war.^[2]
   Key civilian advisors to President Franklin D. Roosevelt included
   Secretary of War Henry Stimson, who mobilized the nation's industries
   and induction centers to supply the Army, commanded by General George
   C. Marshall and the Army Air Forces under General Hap Arnold. The Navy,
   led by Admiral Ernest King, proved more autonomous. Overall priorities
   were set by Roosevelt and the Joint Chiefs, chaired by William D.
   Leahy. Highest priority went to the defeat of Germany in Europe, but
   first the war against Japan in the Pacific was more urgent after the
   sinking of the main battleship fleet at Pearl Harbor.

   Admiral King put Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, based in Hawaii, in charge
   of the Central Pacific War against Japan. The result was a series of
   some of the most famous naval battles in history. The Imperial Japanese
   Navy had the advantage, taking the Philippines as well as British and
   Dutch possessions, and threatening Australia but in June 1942, its main
   carriers were sunk during the Battle of Midway, and the Americans
   seized the initiative. The Pacific War became one of island hopping, so
   as to move air bases closer and closer to Japan. The Army, based in
   Australia under General Douglas MacArthur, steadily advanced across New
   Guinea to the Philippines, with plans to invade the Japanese home
   islands in late 1945. With its merchant fleet sunk by American
   submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil, as the
   U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within bombing range of the
   Japanese home islands. Strategic bombing directed by General Curtis
   Lemay destroyed all the major Japanese cities, as the U.S. captured
   Okinawa after heavy losses in spring 1945. With conventional and atomic
   bombs falling and an invasion imminent, Japan surrendered.

   The war against Germany involved aid to Britain, her allies, and the
   Soviet Union, with the U.S. supplying munitions until it could ready an
   invasion force. U.S. forces were first tested to a limited degree in
   the North African Campaign and then employed more significantly with
   British Forces in Italy in 1942-43, where U.S. forces, representing
   about a third of Allied forces deployed, bogged down after Italy
   surrendered and the Germans took over. Finally the main invasion of
   France took place in June 1944, under Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Meanwhile, the Army Air Forces and RAF systematically targeted German
   transportation links and synthetic oil plants, as it knocked out what
   was left of the Luftwaffe post Battle of Britain in 1944. With the
   Soviets unstoppable in the east, and the Allies unstoppable in the
   west, Germany was squeezed to death. Berlin fell to the Soviets in May
   1945, and with Hitler dead, the Germans surrendered.

   The military effort was strongly supported by civilians on the home
   front, who provided the military personnel, the munitions, the money,
   and the morale to fight the war to victory.

Origins[edit]

   American public opinion was hostile to Hitler's Germany, but how much
   aid to give the Allies was controversial. Public opinion was even more
   hostile to Japan, and there was little opposition to increased support
   for China. By 1940 the U.S., while still neutral, was becoming the
   "Arsenal of Democracy" for the Allies, supplying money and war
   materials. The sudden defeat of France in spring 1940 caused the nation
   to begin to greatly grow its armed forces, including the first
   peacetime draft. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June
   1941, America began sending Lend Lease aid to the Soviet Union as well
   as Britain and China.^[3]

Command system[edit]

   In 1942 President Franklin D. Roosevelt set up a new command structure
   with Admiral Ernest J. King as Chief of Naval Operations in complete
   control of the Navy and Marines, General George C. Marshall in charge
   of the Army, and in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice
   was commanded by General Hap Arnold. Roosevelt formed a new body, the
   Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American
   military strategy. The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency chaired by
   Admiral William D. Leahy, who became FDR's chief military advisor.^[4]
   As the war progressed Marshall became the dominant voice in the JCS in
   the shaping of strategy.^[5] When dealing with Europe, the Joint Chiefs
   met with their British counterparts and formed the Combined Chiefs of
   Staff.^[6] Unlike the political leaders of the other major powers,
   Roosevelt rarely overrode his military advisors.^[7] The civilians
   handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment, but no
   civilians—not even the secretaries of War or Navy, had a voice in
   strategy.^[8] Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high
   level diplomacy through his aides, especially Harry Hopkins. Since
   Hopkins also controlled $50 billion in Lend Lease funds given to the
   Allies, they paid attention to him.

Lend-Lease and Iceland Occupation[edit]

   Main articles: Lend-Lease and First American shots fired in World War
   II
   “ Without American production the United Nations could never have won
     the war.                                                             ”

    — Joseph Stalin during a dinner at the Tehran Conference, 1943^[9]

   Main article: Invasion of Iceland

   The year 1940 marked a change in attitude in the United States. The
   German victories in France, Poland and elsewhere, combined with the
   Battle of Britain, led many Americans to believe that the United States
   would be forced to fight soon. In March 1941, the Lend-Lease program
   began shipping money, munitions, and food to Britain, China, and (by
   that fall) the Soviet Union.

   By 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war, despite
   its nominal neutrality. In spring U-boats began their "wolf-pack"
   tactics which threatened to sever the trans- Atlantic supply line;
   Roosevelt extended the Pan-American Security Zone east almost as far as
   Iceland.

   On 16 June 1941, after negotiation with Churchill, Roosevelt ordered
   the United States occupation of Iceland to replace the British invasion
   forces. On 22 June 1941, the US Navy sent Task Force 19 (TF 19) from
   Charleston, South Carolina to assemble at Argentia, Newfoundland. TF 19
   included 25 warships and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade of 194
   officers and 3714 men from San Diego, California under the command of
   Brigadier General John Marston.^[10] Task Force 19 (TF 19) sailed from
   Argentia on 1 July. On 7 July, Britain persuaded the Althing to approve
   an American occupation force under a U.S.-Icelandic defense agreement,
   and TF 19 anchored off Reykjavík that evening. U.S. Marines commenced
   landing on 8 July, and disembarkation was completed on 12 July. On 6
   August, the U.S. Navy established an air base at Reykjavík with the
   arrival of Patrol Squadron VP-73 PBY Catalinas and VP-74 PBM Mariners.
   U.S. Army personnel began arriving in Iceland in August, and the
   Marines had been transferred to the Pacific by March 1942.^[10] Up to
   40,000 U.S. military personnel were stationed on the island,
   outnumbering adult Icelandic men (at the time, Iceland had a population
   of about 120,000.) The agreement was for the US military to remain
   until the end of the war (although the US military presence in Iceland
   remained through 2006).

   American warships escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic had
   several hostile encounters with U-boats. On 4 September, a German
   U-Boat attacked the destroyer USS Greer off Iceland. A week later
   Roosevelt ordered American warships to shoot U-boats on sight. A U-boat
   shot up the USS Kearny as it escorted a British merchant convoy. The
   USS Reuben James was sunk by U-552 on 31 October 1941.^[11]

Pacific Theater[edit]

The Attack on Pearl Harbor[edit]

   Explosion of the battleship USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor.
   Main article: Attack on Pearl Harbor

   Because of Japanese advances in French Indochina and China, the United
   States, in coordination with the British and Dutch, cut off all oil
   supplies to Japan, which had imported 90% of its oil. The oil embargo
   threatened to grind the Japanese military machine to a halt. Japan
   refused American demands to leave China and decided that war with the
   United States was inevitable; its only hope was to strike first.
   President Roosevelt had months earlier transferred the American fleet
   to Hawaii from California in order to deter the Japanese. Admiral
   Isoroku Yamamoto argued the only way to win the war was to knock out
   the powerful main American fleet immediately. His elaborately trained
   fleet approached within 200 miles of Hawaii without being detected.
   Admiral Chūichi Nagumo held tactical command. Over a five-hour period
   his six carriers sent two waves of 360 dive-bombers, torpedo planes,
   and fighters. They destroyed or severely damaged eight battleships, ten
   smaller warships, and 230 aircraft; 2,403 American servicemen and
   civilians were killed. Japanese losses were negligible—29 planes shot
   down (several American planes were also shot down by anti-aircraft
   fire). Commander Minoru Genda, the chief planner of the raid, begged
   Nagumo to strike again at the shore facilities, oil storage tanks, and
   submarines, and to hunt down the American carriers that were supposedly
   nearby. But Nagumo, having just smashed the Americans in one of the
   greatest victories of naval history, decided not to risk further
   action. Japanese success was due to courage, good equipment, excellent
   pilots, total surprise, and above all, a daring and imaginative plan.
   To even reach Pearl Harbor, they had to learn how to refuel at sea (a
   technique the US Navy already had worked out); to sink all those ships
   they used their superb electric torpedoes and perfected shallow-water
   bombing tactics. Surprise was decisive. While everyone knew that war
   was imminent, no one at Pearl expected an attack. Despite later rumors,
   there was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan. The commanders had
   been complacent about routine defensive measures. Even if the defense
   had been more alert, the surprise and overwhelming power of the
   Japanese strike probably would have been decisive. In broader
   perspective, the attack was a failure. The lost battleships reflected
   obsolete doctrine and were not needed; the lost planes were soon
   replaced; the casualty list was short by World War II standards.
   Tokyo's calculation that the Americans would lose heart and seek a
   compromise peace proved wildly wrong—the "sneak attack" electrified
   public opinion, committing America with near unanimity to a war to the
   death against the Japanese Empire.^[12]^[13]

   States Congress on 8 December 1941.

   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt officially
   pronounced 7 December 1941, as "a date which will live in infamy" and
   asked for a declaration of war on Japan before a joint session of
   Congress on 8 December 1941. The motion passed with only one vote
   against it, in both chambers. Just three days later, on 11 December
   1941 Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States, and had already
   remarked on the evening of the date of the Japanese attack that "We
   can't lose the war at all. We now have an ally which has never been
   conquered in 3,000 years".^[14]

Fall of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies[edit]

   Main article: Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)

   Within hours of Pearl Harbor Japanese air forces from Formosa destroyed
   much of the U.S. Far East Air Force, based near Manila. The Japanese
   army invaded and trapped the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan
   peninsula. Roosevelt evacuated General Douglas MacArthur and the
   nurses, but there was no way to save the trapped men against
   overwhelming Japanese naval power. MacArthur flew to Australia, vowing
   "I came out of Bataan and I shall return." Major General Jonathan M.
   Wainwright surrendered on 8 May; the prisoners died by the thousands in
   the Bataan Death March and in disease-ridden Japanese prison camps
   where food and medicine were in very short supply.^[15]

   The Japanese Navy seemed unstoppable as they seized the Dutch East
   Indies to gain its rich oil resources. The American, British, Dutch,
   and Australian forces were combined under the ABDA command but its
   fleet was quickly sunk in several naval battles around Java.

Solomon Islands and New Guinea Campaign[edit]

   Main article: Solomon Islands Campaign

   Following their rapid advance, the Japanese started the Solomon Islands
   Campaign from their newly conquered main base at Rabaul in January
   1942. The Japanese seized several islands including Tulagi and
   Guadalcanal, before they were halted by further events leading to the
   Guadalcanal Campaign. This campaign also converged with the New Guinea
   campaign.

Battle of the Coral Sea[edit]

   Main article: Battle of the Coral Sea
   See also: Coral Sea order of battle

   In May 1942, the United States fleet engaged the Japanese fleet during
   the first battle in history in which neither fleet fired directly on
   the other, nor did the ships of both fleets actually see each other. It
   was also the first time that aircraft carriers were used in battle.
   While indecisive, it was nevertheless a starting point because American
   commanders learned the tactics that would serve them later in the war.

Battle of the Aleutian Islands[edit]

   Main article: Battle of the Aleutian Islands

   The Battle of the Aleutian Islands was the last battle between
   sovereign nations to be fought on American soil.^[disputed – discuss]
   As part of a diversionary plan for the Battle of Midway, the Japanese
   took control of two of the Aleutian Islands. Their hope was that strong
   American naval forces would be drawn away from Midway, enabling a
   Japanese victory. Because their ciphers were broken, the American
   forces only drove the Japanese out after Midway.

Battle of Midway[edit]

   Main article: Battle of Midway
   See also: Midway order of battle
   The Japanese carrier Hiryu burning after being attacked during the
   battle of Midway

   Having learned important lessons at Coral Sea, the United States Navy
   was prepared when the Japanese navy under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto
   launched an offensive aimed at destroying the American Pacific Fleet at
   Midway Island. The Japanese hoped to embarrass the Americans after the
   humiliation of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. Midway was a strategic
   island that both sides wished to use as an air base. Yamamoto hoped to
   achieve complete surprise and a quick capture of the island, followed
   by a decisive carrier battle with which he could completely destroy the
   American carrier fleet. Before the battle began, however, American
   intelligence intercepted his plan, allowing Admiral Chester Nimitz to
   formulate an effective defensive ambush of the Japanese fleet.^[16] The
   battle began on 4 June 1942. By the time it was over, the Japanese had
   lost four carriers, as opposed to one American carrier lost. The Battle
   of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific because the
   United States had seized the initiative and was on the offensive for
   the duration of the war.

Island hopping[edit]

   Following the resounding victory at Midway, the United States began a
   major land offensive. The Allies came up with a strategy known as
   Island hopping, or the bypassing of islands that either served little
   or no strategic importance^[17] or were heavily defended but could be
   bypassed, such as Rabaul. Because air power was crucial to any
   operation, only islands that could support airstrips were targeted by
   the Allies. The fighting for each island in the Pacific Theater would
   be savage, as the Americans faced a determined and battle-hardened
   enemy who had known little defeat on the ground.

Air strategy[edit]

   General George Kenney, in charge of tactical air power under MacArthur,
   never had enough planes, pilots or supplies.^[18] (He was not allowed
   any authority whatsoever over the Navy's carriers.) But the Japanese
   were always in worse shape—their equipment deteriorated rapidly because
   of poor airfields and incompetent maintenance. The Japanese had
   excellent planes and pilots in 1942, but ground commanders dictated
   their missions and ignored the need for air superiority before any
   other mission could be attempted. Theoretically, Japanese doctrine
   stressed the need to gain air superiority, but the infantry commanders
   repeatedly wasted air assets defending minor positions. When Arnold,
   echoing the official Army line, stated the Pacific was a "defensive"
   theater, Kenney retorted that the Japanese pilot was always on the
   offensive. "He attacks all the time and persists in acting that way. To
   defend against him you not only have to attack him but to beat him to
   the punch."^[19]
   P-38 Lightning

   Key to Kenney's strategy was the neutralization of bypassed Japanese
   strongpoints like Rabaul and Truk through repeated bombings. He said a
   major shortfall was "the kids coming here from the States were green as
   grass. They were not getting enough gunnery, acrobatics, formation
   flying, or night flying."^[20] So he set up extensive retraining
   programs. The arrival of superior fighters, especially the twin-tailed
   Lockheed P-38 Lightning, gave the Americans an edge in range and
   performance. Occasionally a ripe target appeared, as in the Battle of
   the Bismarck Sea (March 1943) when bombers sank a major convoy bringing
   troops and supplies to New Guinea. That success was no fluke.
   High-flying bombers almost never could hit moving ships. Kenney solved
   that weakness by teaching pilots the effective new tactic of flying in
   close to the water then pulling up and lobbing bombs that skipped
   across the water and into the target.^[21]

Building airfields[edit]

   The goal of island hopping was to build forward air fields. AAF
   commander General Hap Arnold correctly anticipated that he would have
   to build forward airfields in inhospitable places. Working closely with
   the Army Corps of Engineers, he created Aviation Engineer Battalions
   that by 1945 included 118,000 men; it operated in all theatres.
   Runways, hangars, radar stations, power generators, barracks, gasoline
   storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny
   coral islands, mud flats, featureless deserts, dense jungles, or
   exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire. The heavy
   construction gear had to be imported, along with the engineers,
   blueprints, steel-mesh landing mats, prefabricated hangars, aviation
   fuel, bombs and ammunition, and all necessary supplies. As soon as one
   project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move
   forward to the next challenge, while headquarters inked in a new
   airfield on the maps. Heavy rains often reduced the capacity of old
   airfields, so new ones were built. Often engineers had to repair and
   use a captured enemy airfield. Unlike the well-built German air fields
   in Europe, the Japanese installations were ramshackle affairs with poor
   siting, poor drainage, scant protection, and narrow, bumpy runways.
   Engineering was a low priority for the offense-minded Japanese, who
   chronically lacked adequate equipment and imagination.^[22]

Combat experience[edit]

   Airmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe, and
   although rest time in Australia was scheduled, there was no fixed
   number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat, as was
   the case in Europe. coupled with the monotonous, hot, sickly
   environment, the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly
   passed along to newcomers. After a few months, epidemics of combat
   fatigue (now called Combat stress reaction) would drastically reduce
   the efficiency of units. The men who had been at jungle airfields
   longest, the flight surgeons reported, were in a bad shape:

                Many have chronic dysentery or other disease, and almost
                all show chronic fatigue states. . . .They appear
                listless, unkempt, careless, and apathetic with almost
                masklike facial expression. Speech is slow, thought
                content is poor, they complain of chronic headaches,
                insomnia, memory defect, feel forgotten, worry about
                themselves, are afraid of new assignments, have no sense
                of responsibility, and are hopeless about the
                future."^[23]

Marine Aviation and the issue of ground support[edit]

   Chance-Vought F4U Corsair

   The Marines had their own land-based aviation, built around the
   excellent Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, an unusually large fighter-bomber.
   By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons. Marine
   Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops,
   but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior
   component of naval aviation. The new mission was to protect the fleet
   from enemy air attacks. Marine pilots, like all aviators, fiercely
   believed in the prime importance of air superiority; they did not wish
   to be tied down to supporting ground troops. On the other hand, the
   ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy
   firepower of their own. Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground
   forces; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy
   artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the
   battlefield. The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed
   air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead. In 1944, after
   considerable internal acrimony, Marine Aviation was forced to start
   helping out. At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party (ALP) not
   only requested air support, but actually directed it in tactical
   detail. The Marine formula increased responsiveness, reduced "friendly"
   casualties, and (flying weather permitting) substituted well for the
   missing armor and artillery. For the next half century close air
   support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation,
   provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to
   operate fixed-wing fighters or bombers, although the Army was allowed
   to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes.^[24]

Guadalcanal[edit]

   Main article: Battle of Guadalcanal
   See also: Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle

   Guadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943, was the first
   major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign
   pitted American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by
   Australians and New Zealanders) against determined Japanese resistance.
   Guadalcanal was the key to control the Solomon Islands, which both
   sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but
   both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines. Logistical
   failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone. As
   happened time and again in the Pacific, the Japanese logistical support
   system failed, as only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to
   Guadalcanal ever reached there. Consequently the 30,000 Japanese troops
   lacked heavy equipment, adequate ammunition and even enough food;
   10,000 were killed, 10,000 starved to death, and the remaining 10,000
   were evacuated in February 1943. In the end Guadalcanal was a major
   American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate
   of American reinforcements proved decisive. Guadalcanal is an iconic
   episode in the annals of American military history, underscoring heroic
   bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined
   foe.^[25]

   Marines from the 1st Marine Division and soldiers from the Army XIV
   Corps landed on 7 August 1942. They quickly captured Henderson Field,
   and prepared defenses. In the Battle of Bloody Ridge, the Americans
   held off wave after wave of Japanese counterattacks before charging
   what was left of the Japanese. After more than six months of combat the
   island was firmly in control of the Allies on 8 February 1943.

   Meanwhile the rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides
   diving the victories.^[26] They were: Battle of Savo Island, Battle of
   the Eastern Solomons, Battle of Cape Esperance, Battle of the Santa
   Cruz Islands, Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Battle of Tassafaronga and
   Battle of Rennell Island.

Tarawa[edit]

   Main article: Battle of Tarawa

   bunker.

   Guadalcanal made it clear to the Americans that the Japanese would
   fight to the bitter end. After brutal fighting in which few prisoners
   were taken on either side, the United States and the Allies pressed on
   the offensive. The landings at Tarawa on 20 November 1943, by the
   Americans became bogged down as armor attempting to break through the
   Japanese lines of defense either sank, were disabled or took on too
   much water to be of use. The Americans were eventually able to land a
   limited number of tanks and drive inland. After days of fighting they
   took control of Tarawa on 23 November. Of the original 2,600 Japanese
   soldiers on the island, only 17 were still alive.

Operations in Central Pacific[edit]

   In preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Allies started
   the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign to retake the Gilbert and
   Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Moving closer to
   Japan, the U.S. Navy decisively won the Battle of the Philippine Sea
   and landing forces captured the Mariana and Palau Islands in summer
   1944. The goal was building airbases within range of the new B-29
   bomber aimed at Japan's industrial cities.

Liberation of the Philippines[edit]

   Gulf

   The Battle of Leyte Gulf in 23–26 October 1944, was a decisive American
   victory that sank virtually the entire remaining Japanese fleet in the
   largest naval battle in history. Although the Japanese came
   surprisingly close to inflicting a major defeat on the Americans, at
   the last minute the Japanese panicked and lost. The battle was a
   complex overlapping series of engagements fought off the Philippine
   island of Leyte, which the U.S. Army had just invaded. The army forces
   were highly vulnerable to naval attack, and the Japanese goal was to
   inflict massive destruction. Two American fleets were involved, the
   Seventh and Third, but they were independent and did not communicate
   well so the Japanese with a trick maneuver slipped between the two
   American fleets and almost reached the beaches. However the Japanese
   communication system was even worse, and the Japanese army and navy did
   not cooperate, and the three Japanese fleets were each destroyed.^[27]

   General MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines by
   landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944. The grueling re-capture of the
   Philippines took place from 1944 to 1945 and included the battles of
   Leyte, Luzon, and Mindanao.

Iwo Jima[edit]

   Main article: Battle of Iwo Jima

   The Americans did not bypass the small island of Iwo Jima because it
   wanted bases for fighter escorts; it was actually used as an emergency
   landing base for B-29s. The Japanese knew they could not win, but they
   devised a strategy to maximize American casualties. Learning from the
   Battle of Saipan they prepared many fortified positions on the island,
   including pillboxes and underground tunnels. The Marines attack began
   on 19 February 1945. Initially the Japanese put up no resistance,
   letting the Americans mass, creating more targets before the Americans
   took intense fire from Mount Suribachi and fought throughout the night
   until the hill was surrounded. Over the next 36 days, the Japanese were
   pressed into an ever shrinking pocket, but they chose to fight on to
   the end, leaving only 1,000 of the original 21,000 defenders alive. The
   Marines suffered as well, suffering 25,000 casualties. The battle
   became iconic in America as the epitome of heroism in desperate
   hand-to-hand combat.^[28]

Okinawa[edit]

   Main article: Battle of Okinawa

   Okinawa became the last major battle of the Pacific Theater and the
   Second World War. The island was to become a staging area for the
   eventual invasion of Japan since it was just 350 miles (550 km) south
   of the Japanese mainland. Marines and soldiers landed unopposed on 1
   April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest
   land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the
   fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans
   losing their lives. Japanese kamikaze pilots caused the largest loss of
   ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of
   another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000
   wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 men. The fierce combat
   and high American losses led the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main
   islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the atomic bomb to
   induce surrender.^[29]

Strategic Bombing of Japan[edit]

   Main article: Air raids on Japan

   The flammability of Japan's large cities, and the concentration of
   munitions production there, made strategic bombing the favorite
   strategy of the Americans from 1941 onward. The first efforts were made
   from bases in China, where massive efforts to establish B-29 bases
   there and supply them over the Hump (the Himalayas) failed in 1944; the
   Japanese Army simply moved overland and captured the bases. Saipan and
   Tinian, captured by the U.S. in June 1944, gave secure bases for the
   very-long-range B-29. The Boeing B-29 Superfortress boasted four 2,200
   horsepower Wright R-3350 supercharged engines that could lift four tons
   of bombs 33,000 feet (high above Japanese flak or fighters), and make
   3,500 mile round trips. However, the systematic raids that began in
   June 1944, were unsatisfactory, because the AAF had learned too much in
   Europe; it overemphasized self-defense. Arnold, in personal charge of
   the campaign (bypassing the theater commanders) brought in a new
   leader, brilliant, indefatigable, hard-charging General Curtis LeMay.
   In early 1945, LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics: remove the
   machine guns and gunners, fly in low at night. (Much fuel was used to
   get to 30,000 feet; it could now be replaced with more bombs.) The
   Japanese radar, fighter, and anti-aircraft systems were so ineffective
   that they could not hit the bombers. Fires raged through the cities,
   and millions of civilians fled to the mountains.^[30]

   Tokyo was hit repeatedly, and suffered a fire storm in March that
   killed 83,000. On 5 June, 51,000 buildings in four miles of Kobe were
   burned out by 473 B-29s; the Japanese were learning to fight back, as
   11 B-29s went down and 176 were damaged.^[31] Osaka, where one-sixth of
   the Empire's munitions were made, was hit by 1,733 tons of incendiaries
   dropped by 247 B-29s. A firestorm burned out 8.1 square miles,
   including 135,000 houses; 4,000 died.^[32]^[33] The Japanese local
   officials reported:

          Although damage to big factories was slight, approximately
          one-fourth of some 4,000 lesser factories, which operated
          hand-in-hand with the big factories, were completely destroyed
          by fire.... Moreover, owing to the rising fear of air attacks,
          workers in general were reluctant to work in the factories, and
          the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent.

   The Japanese army, which was not based in the cities, was largely
   undamaged by the raids. The Army was short of food and gasoline, but,
   as Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved, it was capable of ferocious resistance.
   The Japanese also had a new tactic that it hoped would provide the
   bargaining power to get a satisfactory peace, the Kamikaze.

Kamikaze[edit]

   In late 1944 the Japanese invented an unexpected and highly effective
   new tactic, the Kamikaze suicide plane aimed like a guided missile at
   American ships. The attacks began in October 1944 and continued to the
   end of the war. Experienced pilots were used to lead a mission because
   they could navigate; they were not Kamikazes, and they returned to base
   for another mission. The Kamikaze pilots were inexperienced and had
   minimal training; however most were well educated and intensely
   committed to the Emperor.^[34]^[35]
   A "Judy" in a suicide dive against USS Essex. The dive brakes are
   extended and the port wing tank is trailing fuel vapor and smoke 25
   November 1944.

   Kamikaze attacks were highly effective at the Battle of Okinawa as 4000
   kamikaze sorties sank 38 US ships and damaged 368 more, killing 4,900
   sailors.^[36] Task Force 58 analyzed the Japanese technique at Okinawa
   in April 1945:

          "Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and
          made with such reckless determination. These attacks were
          generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with
          radical changes in course and altitude, dispersing when
          intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage. They
          tailed our friendlies home, used decoy planes, and came in at
          any altitude or on the water."^[37]

   The Americans decided best defense against Kamikazes was to knock them
   out on the ground, or else in the air long before they approached the
   fleet. The Navy called for more fighters, and more warning, which meant
   combat air patrols circling the big ships, more radar picket ships
   (which themselves became prime targets), and more attacks on airbases
   and gasoline supplies. Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945,
   because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation
   for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home
   islands. The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and
   obsolete planes, and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there
   was no return trip, the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched
   further. Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all
   the way to the target, the proportion of hits was much higher than in
   ordinary bombing. Japan's industry was manufacturing 1,500 new planes a
   month in 1945. However, the quality of construction was very poor, and
   many new planes crashed during training or before reaching targets.

   Expecting increased resistance, including far more Kamikaze attacks
   once the main islands of Japan were invaded, the U.S. high command
   rethought its strategy and used atomic bombs to end the war, hoping it
   would make a costly invasion unnecessary.^[38]
   Main article: Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
   See also: Operation Downfall

   As victory for the United States slowly approached, casualties mounted.
   A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland
   Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies, as
   casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate.
   President Harry Truman gave the order to drop the first atomic bomb on
   Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, hoping that the destruction of the city
   would break Japanese resolve and end the war. A second bomb was dropped
   on Nagasaki on 9 August after it appeared that the Japanese high
   command was not planning to surrender. Approximately 140,000 people
   died in Hiroshima from the bomb and its aftereffects by the end of
   1945, and approximately 74,000 in Nagasaki.

   V-J Day which occurred on 15 August 1945 marked the end of the United
   States' war with the Empire of Japan. Since Japan was the last
   remaining Axis Power, V-J Day also marked the end of World War II.

Minor American front[edit]

   Main article: China Burma India Theater

   The United States contributed several forces to the China Burma India
   theater, such as a volunteer air squadron (later incorporated into the
   Army Air Force), and Merrill's Marauders, an infantry unit. The U.S.
   also had an adviser to Chiang Kai-shek, Joseph Stillwell.

European and North African Theaters[edit]

Europe first[edit]

   Main article: Europe first
   See also: European Theater of Operations
   The conquests of Nazi Germany.

   The established grand strategy of the Allies was to defeat Germany and
   its allies in Europe first, and then focus could shift towards Japan in
   the Pacific. This was because two of the Allied capitals (London and
   Moscow) could be directly threatened by Germany, but none of the major
   Allied capitals were threatened by Japan. Germany was the United
   Kingdom's primary threat, especially after the Fall of France in 1940,
   which saw Germany overrun most of the countries of Western Europe,
   leaving the United Kingdom alone to combat Germany. Germany's planned
   invasion of the UK, Operation Sea Lion, was averted by its failure to
   establish air superiority in the Battle of Britain. At the same time,
   war with Japan in East Asia seemed increasingly likely. Although the
   U.S. was not yet at war with either Germany or Japan, it met with the
   UK on several occasions to formulate joint strategies. In the March 29,
   1941 report of the ABC-1 conference, the Americans and British agreed
   that their strategic objectives were: (1) "The early defeat of Germany
   as the predominant member of the Axis with the principal military
   effort of the United States being exerted in the Atlantic and European
   area;" and (2) A strategic defensive in the Far East." Thus, the
   Americans concurred with the British in the grand strategy of "Europe
   first" (or "Germany first") in carrying out military operations in
   World War II. The UK feared that, if the United States was diverted
   from its main focus in Europe to the Pacific (Japan), Hitler might
   crush both the Soviet Union and Britain, and would then become an
   unconquerable fortress in Europe. The wound inflicted on the United
   States by Japan at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 did not result in a
   change in U.S. policy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill hastened to
   Washington shortly after Pearl Harbor for the Arcadia Conference to
   ensure that the Americans didn't have second thoughts about Europe
   First. The two countries reaffirmed that, "notwithstanding the entry of
   Japan into the War, our view remains that Germany is still the prime
   enemy. and her defeat is the key to victory. Once Germany is defeated
   the collapse of Italy and the defeat of Japan must follow."

Operation Torch[edit]

   Main article: Operation Torch

   The United States entered the war in the west with Operation Torch on 8
   November 1942, after their Soviet allies had pushed for a second front
   against the Germans. General Dwight Eisenhower commanded the assault on
   North Africa, and Major General George Patton struck at Casablanca.

Allied victory in North Africa[edit]

   Main article: North African Campaign

   The United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against Nazi
   Germany. Early in 1943, the U.S. Army suffered a near-disastrous defeat
   at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in February. The senior Allied
   leadership was primarily to blame for the loss as internal bickering
   between American General Lloyd Fredendall and the British led to
   mistrust and little communication, causing inadequate troop
   placements.^[40] The defeat could be considered a major turning point,
   however, because General Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with General
   Patton.

   Slowly the Allies stopped the German advance in Tunisia and by March
   were pushing back. In mid April, under British General Bernard
   Montgomery, the Allies smashed through the Mareth Line and broke the
   Axis defense in North Africa. On 13 May 1943, Axis troops in North
   Africa surrendered, leaving behind 275,000 men. Allied efforts turned
   towards Sicily and Italy.

Invasion of Sicily and Italy[edit]

   Main articles: Allied invasion of Sicily and Allied invasion of Italy

   The first stepping stone for the Allied liberation of Europe was, in
   Prime Minister Winston Churchill's words, the "soft underbelly" of
   Europe on the Italian island of Sicily. Launched on 9 July 1943,
   Operation Husky was, at the time, the largest amphibious operation ever
   undertaken. The operation was a success, and on 17 August the Allies
   were in control of the island.

   Following the Allied victory in Sicily, Italian public sentiment swung
   against the war and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. He was deposed
   in a coup, and the Allies struck quickly, hoping resistance would be
   slight. The first American troops landed on the Italian peninsula in
   September 1943, and Italy surrendered on 8 September. German troops in
   Italy were prepared, however, and took up the defensive positions. As
   winter approached, the Allies made slow progress against the heavily
   defended German Winter Line, until the victory at Monte Cassino. Rome
   fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944.

Strategic bombing[edit]

   World War II

   Numerous bombing runs were launched by the United States aimed at the
   industrial heart of Germany. Using the high altitude B-17, it was
   necessary for the raids to be conducted in daylight for the drops to be
   accurate. As adequate fighter escort was rarely available, the bombers
   would fly in tight, box formations, allowing each bomber to provide
   overlapping machine-gun fire for defense. The tight formations made it
   impossible to evade fire from Luftwaffe fighters, however, and American
   bomber crew losses were high. One such example was the
   Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission, which resulted in staggering losses of
   men and equipment. The introduction of the revered P-51 Mustang, which
   had enough fuel to make a round trip to Germany's heartland, helped to
   reduce losses later in the war. In mid-1942, the United States Army Air
   Forces (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the
   English Channel. The USAAF Eighth Air Force's B-17 bombers were called
   the "Flying Fortresses" because of their heavy defensive armament of
   ten to twelve machine guns, and armor plating in vital locations. In
   part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller
   bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's
   commanders in Washington, DC, and in Great Britain adopted the strategy
   of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by
   mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at
   high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the U.S. Government and
   its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and
   towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the
   Norden bombsight, the USAAF should be able to carry out "precision
   bombing" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval
   bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants,
   steel mills, airfields, etc.

   In January 1943, at the Casablanca Conference, it was agreed RAF Bomber
   Command operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in
   a Combined Operations Offensive plan called Operation Pointblank. Chief
   of the British Air Staff MRAF Sir Charles Portal was put in charge of
   the "strategic direction" of both British and American bomber
   operations. The text of the Casablanca directive read: "Your primary
   object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the
   German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of
   the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for
   armed resistance is fatally weakened.", At the beginning of the
   combined strategic bombing offensive on 4 March 1943 669 RAF and 303
   USAAF heavy bombers were available.

   In the late 1943, the 'Pointblank' attacks manifested themselves in the
   infamous Schweinfurt raids (first and second). Formations of unescorted
   bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly
   toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a
   long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the P-51
   Mustang, which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.

   USAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of "precision bombing" of
   military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were
   simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received
   the first H2X radar sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the
   arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for
   them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on
   average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in
   Europe.

   In reality, the day bombing was "precision bombing" only in the sense
   that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such
   as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as "the
   target area" a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming
   point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies
   show that, in the over-all, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at
   precision targets fell within this target area. In the fall of 1944,
   only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit
   within 1,000 feet of their aim point. The only offensive ordnance
   possessed by the USAAF that was guidable, the VB-1 Azon, saw very
   limited service in both Europe and in the CBI Theater late in the war.

   Nevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by
   night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and, more
   importantly from a military point of view, forced Germany to divert
   resources to counter it. This was to be the real significance of the
   Allied strategic bombing campaign—resource allocation. For the sake of
   improving the US air-force Fire bombing capabilities a mock-up German
   Village was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full
   scale replicas of German residential homes. Fire bombing attacks proved
   quite successful, in a single 1943 attack on Hamburg roughly 50,000
   civilians were killed and practically the entire city destroyed.

   A raid by the 8th Air Force on the Focke Wulf factory at Marienburg,
   Germany (1943). With the arrival of the brand-new Fifteenth Air Force,
   based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was
   consolidated into the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF). With
   the addition of the Mustang to its strength, the Combined Bomber
   Offensive was resumed. Planners targeted the Luftwaffe in an operation
   known as 'Big Week' (20–25 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly –
   losses were so heavy German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal
   of industry and the day fighter arm never fully recovered.

   On 27 March 1944, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued orders granting
   control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic
   bombers, to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander,
   who delegated command to his deputy in SHAEF Air Chief Marshal Arthur
   Tedder. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures,
   including Winston Churchill, Harris, and Carl Spaatz, but after some
   debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined
   Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well
   on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they
   continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned
   their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the Normandy
   Invasion. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic
   bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the USSTAF.

   The twin campaigns—the USAAF by day, the RAF by night—built up into
   massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably the Ruhr, followed
   by attacks directly on cities such as Hamburg, Kassel, Pforzheim, Mainz
   and the often-criticized bombing of Dresden.

Operation Overlord[edit]

   Main article: Operation Overlord

   The second European front that the Soviets had pressed for was finally
   opened on 6 June 1944, when the Allies attacked the heavily fortified
   Atlantic Wall. Supreme Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower
   had delayed the attack because of bad weather, but finally the largest
   amphibious assault in history began.

   After prolonged bombing runs on the French coast by the Army Air
   Forces, 225 U.S. Army Rangers scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc under
   intense enemy fire and destroyed the German gun emplacements that could
   have threatened the amphibious landings.

   Also prior to the main amphibious assault, the American 82nd and 101st
   Airborne divisions dropped behind the beaches into Nazi-occupied
   France, in an effort to protect the coming landings. Many of the
   paratroopers had not been dropped on their intended landing zones and
   were scattered throughout Normandy.

   As the paratroops fought their way through the hedgerows, the main
   amphibious landings began. The Americans came ashore at the beaches
   codenamed 'Omaha' and 'Utah'. The landing craft bound for Utah, as with
   so many other units, went off course, coming ashore two kilometers off
   target. The 4th Infantry Division faced weak resistance during the
   landings and by the afternoon were linked up with paratroopers fighting
   their way towards the coast.

   However, at Omaha the Germans had prepared the beaches with land mines,
   Czech hedgehogs and Belgian Gates in anticipation of the invasion.
   Intelligence prior to the landings had placed the less experienced
   German 714th Division in charge of the defense of the beach. However,
   the highly trained and experienced 352nd moved in days before the
   invasion. As a result, the soldiers from the 1st and 29th Infantry
   Divisions became pinned down by superior enemy fire immediately after
   leaving their landing craft. In some instances, entire landing craft
   full of men were mowed down by the well-positioned German defenses. As
   the casualties mounted, the soldiers formed impromptu units and
   advanced inland.

   The small units then fought their way through the minefields that were
   in between the Nazi machine-gun bunkers. After squeezing through, they
   then attacked the bunkers from the rear, allowing more men to come
   safely ashore.

   By the end of the day, the Americans suffered over 6,000 casualties.
   Omaha Beach is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied
   invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June
   1944, during World War II. The beach is located on the coast of
   Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, and is 5 miles (8 km)
   long, from east of Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes to west of
   Vierville-sur-Mer on the right bank of the Douve River estuary.
   Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British landings
   to the east at Gold Beach with the American landing to the west at Utah
   Beach, thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of
   the Bay of the Seine. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of
   United States Army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery
   support provided by the U.S. Navy and elements of the British Royal
   Navy.

   On D-Day, the untested 29th Infantry Division, joined by the veteran
   1st Infantry Division and nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers
   redirected from Pointe du Hoc, were to assault the western half of the
   beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern
   half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and
   combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal
   defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.

   The primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of some five
   miles (eight kilometres) depth, between Port-en-Bessin and the Vire
   River, linking with the British landings at Gold Beach to the east, and
   reaching the area of Isigny to the west to link up with VII Corps
   landing at Utah Beach. Opposing the landings was the German 352nd
   Infantry Division, a large portion of whom were teenagers, though they
   were supplemented by veterans who had fought on the Eastern Front. The
   352nd had never had any battalion or regimental training. Of the 12,020
   men of the division, only 6,800 were experienced combat troops,
   detailed to defend a 53-kilometre-long (33-mile) front. The Germans
   were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast—the German
   strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line.
   Nevertheless, Allied calculations indicated that Omaha's defenses were
   three times as strong as those they had encountered during the Battle
   of Kwajalein, and its defenders were four times as many.[1] Very little
   went as planned during the landing at Omaha Beach. Difficulties in
   navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets
   throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and
   inflicted heavy casualties on landing US troops. Under heavy fire, the
   engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings
   bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the
   casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could
   not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further
   problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations
   were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised
   assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points.
   By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which
   were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland,
   thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days．

Operation Cobra[edit]

   Main article: Operation Cobra

   After the amphibious assault, the Allied forces remained stalled in
   Normandy for some time, advancing much more slowly than expected with
   close-fought infantry battles in the dense hedgerows. However, with
   Operation Cobra, launched on 24 July with mostly American troops, the
   Allies succeeded in breaking the German lines and sweeping out into
   France with fast-moving armored divisions. This led to a major defeat
   for the Germans, with 400,000 soldiers trapped in the Falaise pocket,
   and the capture of Paris on 25 August.

Operation Market Garden[edit]

   Paratroopers landing in the Netherlands.

   The next major Allied operation came on 17 September. Devised by
   British General Bernard Montgomery, its primary objective was the
   capture of several bridges in the Netherlands. Fresh off of their
   successes in Normandy, the Allies were optimistic that an attack on the
   Nazi-occupied Netherlands would force open a route across the Rhine and
   onto the North German Plain. Such an opening would allow Allied forces
   to break out northward and advance toward Denmark and, ultimately,
   Berlin.

   The plan involved a daylight drop of the American 82nd and 101st
   Airborne Divisions. The 101st was to capture the bridges at Eindhoven,
   with the 82nd taking the bridges at Grave and Nijmegen. After the
   bridges had been captured, the ground force, also known as XXX Corps or
   "Garden", would drive up a single road and link up with the paratroops.

   The operation failed because the Allies were unable to capture the
   bridge furthest to the north at Arnhem. There, the British 1st Airborne
   had been dropped to secure the bridges, but upon landing they
   discovered that a highly experienced German SS Panzer unit was
   garrisoning the town. The paratroopers were only lightly equipped in
   respect to anti-tank weaponry and quickly lost ground. Failure to
   quickly relieve those members of the 1st who had managed to seize the
   bridge at Arnhem on the part of the balance of the 6th, as well as the
   armored XXX Corps, meant that the Germans were able to stymie the
   entire operation. In the end, the operation's ambitious nature, the
   fickle state of war, and failures on the part of Allied intelligence
   (as well as tenacious German defense) can be blamed for Market-Garden's
   ultimate failure. This operation also signaled the last time that
   either the 82nd or 101st would make a combat jump during the war.

Operation Queen[edit]

   Main articles: Battle of Hürtgen Forest and Operation Queen

   Unable to push north into the Netherlands, the Allies in western Europe
   were forced to consider other options to get into Germany. In the
   summer of 1944, the Allies suffered from a large supply crisis, due the
   long supply route, but by fall 1944, this has largely been resolved
   (Red Ball Express). As part of the Siegfriend Line Campaign, the Allies
   tried to push into Germany towards the Rhine. As a first step, Aachen
   was captured during a heavy battle. The Germans now had the advantage
   of their old fortification system, the Siegfried line. During the
   Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the Allies fought a long battle of attrition
   with the Germans, which ended initially in a stalemate, with the Allies
   unable to take the complete forest. The battle of the Hürtgen Forrest
   was later absorbed by a larger offensive, Operation Queen. During this
   offensive, the Allies intended to push towards the Rur River, as a
   staging point for a subsequent thrust over the river to the Rhine into
   Germany. However, against underestimated and stiffened German
   resistance the Allies were only able to make slow progress. By
   mid-December the Allies were finally at the Rur, but by then the
   Germans had completed in preparing their own offensive through the
   Ardennes, which was launched in the midst of an unsuccessful Allied
   attack against the Rur dams.

Battle of the Bulge[edit]

   Main articles: Battle of the Bulge, Battle of Bastogne and Operation
   Nordwind
   The "bulge" created by the German offensive.

   On 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a massive attack westward in
   the Ardennes forest, hoping to punch a hole in the Allied lines and
   capture the Belgian city of Antwerp. The Allies responded slowly,
   allowing the German attack to create a large "bulge" in the Allied
   lines. In the initial stages of the offensive, American POW's from the
   285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion were executed at the
   Malmedy massacre by Nazi SS and Fallschirmjäger.

   As the Germans pushed westward, General Eisenhower ordered the 101st
   Airborne and elements of the U.S. 10th Armored Division into the road
   junction town of Bastogne to prepare a defense. The town quickly became
   cut off and surrounded. The winter weather slowed Allied air support,
   and the defenders were outnumbered and low on supplies. When given a
   request for their surrender from the Germans, General Anthony
   McAuliffe, acting commander of the 101st, replied, "Nuts!",
   contributing to the stubborn American defense.^[41] On 19 December,
   General Patton told Eisenhower that he could have his army in Bastogne
   in 48 hours. Patton then turned his army, at the time on the front in
   Luxembourg, north to break through to Bastogne. Patton's armor pushed
   north, and by 26 December was in Bastogne, effectively ending the
   siege. By the time it was over, more American soldiers had served in
   the battle than in any engagement in American history.^[42]

   On 31 December, the Germans launched their last major offensive of the
   war on the Western Front, Operation Nordwind, in Alsace and Lorraine in
   northeastern France. Against weakened American forces there, the
   Germans were able to push the Americans back to the south bank of the
   Moder River on 21 January. On 25 January, Allied reinforcements from
   the Ardennes arrived, the German offensive was stopped and in fierce
   fighting the so-called Colmar Pocket was eliminated. The Battle of the
   Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive
   campaign launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of
   Wallonia in Belgium, France and Luxembourg on the Western Front toward
   the end of World War II in Europe. The surprise attack caught the
   Allied forces completely off guard and became the costliest battle in
   terms of casualties for the United States, whose forces bore the brunt
   of the attack, during all of World War II. It also severely depleted
   Germany's war-making resources and was the country's final offensive
   operation of the war.

   The battle was known by different names. The Germans referred to it as
   Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein ("Operation Watch on the Rhine"), while the
   French named it the Bataille des Ardennes. The Allies called it the
   Ardennes Counteroffensive. The phrase "Battle of the Bulge" was coined
   by contemporary press to describe the way the Allied front line bulged
   inward on wartime news maps and became the most well-known name for the
   battle.

   The German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations
   known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and Währung. Germany's goal
   for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line
   in half, capturing Antwerp and then proceed to encircle and destroy
   four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace
   treaty in the Axis Powers' favour. Once accomplished, Hitler could
   fully concentrate on the eastern theatre of war.

   The offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio
   traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The
   Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German
   offensive, and Ultra indicated that a "substantial and offensive"
   operation was expected or "in the wind", although a precise date or
   point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Soviet
   Front to the Ardennes and transport of forces by rail to the Ardennes
   was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by
   Peter Calvocoressi and F. L. Lucas at the codebreaking centre Bletchley
   Park.

   Near-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied
   overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor
   aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section
   of the Allied line, taking advantage of a heavy overcast, which
   grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce
   resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around Elsenborn
   Ridge and in the south around Bastogne blocked German access to key
   roads to the west that they counted on for success. This and terrain
   that favoured the defenders threw the German timetable behind schedule
   and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved
   weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply
   lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the
   defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of
   men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the
   Siegfried Line.

   With about 610,000 men committed and some 89,000 casualties, including
   19,000 killed, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest and bloodiest
   battle fought by the United States in World War II

Race to Berlin[edit]

   Following the defeat of the German army in the Ardennes, the Allies
   pushed back towards the Rhine and the heart of Germany. With the
   capture of the Ludendorff bridge at Remagen, the Allies crossed the
   Rhine in March 1945. The Americans then executed a pincer movement,
   setting up the Ninth Army north, and the First Army south. When the
   Allies closed the pincer, 300,000 Germans were captured in the Ruhr
   Pocket. The Americans then turned east, meeting up with the Soviets at
   the Elbe River in April. The Germans surrendered Berlin to the Soviets
   on 2 May 1945.

   The war in Europe came to an official end on V-E Day, 8 May 1945.
