   A multi-axis political spectrum chart; a variant of the Nolan chart

   Political ideologies in the United States vary considerably. Persons in
   the U.S. generally classify themselves either as adhering to positions
   along the political spectrum as liberal-progressive, moderate, or
   conservative. Modern American liberalism aims at the preservation and
   extension of human, social and civil rights as well as the government
   guaranteed provision of positive rights. It combines social
   progressivism and to some extent, ordoliberalism and is highly similar
   to European social liberalism. American conservatism commonly refers to
   a combination of economic liberalism and libertarianism, and to an
   extent, social conservatism. It aims at protecting the concept of small
   government, while promoting traditional values on some social issues.

   The ideological position a person or party takes may be explained in
   terms of social and economic policy. The ideological positions a person
   assumes on social and economic policy issues may differ in their
   position on the political spectrum. Milton Friedman, for example, was
   left-of-center on social issues but right-of-center on fiscal
   matters.^[1] Several ideological demographics may be identified in
   addition to or as subgroups of liberals and conservatives with nearly
   every possible ideology being found in the general population.

   In the U.S., the Democratic Party generally represents liberal ideals,
   while the Republican Party commonly represents conservative ideals.
   Smaller parties such as the Libertarian Party play a minor role in
   American politics.

   The size of ideological groups varies slightly depending on the poll.
   Gallup/USA Today polling in June 2010 revealed that 42% of those
   surveyed identify as conservative, 35% as moderate, while 20% identify
   as liberal.^[2] In another polling in June 2010, 40% of American voters
   identify themselves as conservatives, 36% as moderates and 22% as
   liberals, with a strong majority of both liberals and conservatives
   describing themselves as closer to the center than to the extremes.^[3]
   As of 2013, self-identified conservatives stand at 34%, moderates at
   38%, and liberals at 23%.^[4]

   In a 2005 study, the Pew Research Center identified nine typological
   groups. Three groups were identified as part of each, "the left," "the
   middle," and "the right." In this categorization system, "the right"
   roughly represents the Republican base, those on "the left" the
   Democratic base and those in "the middle" independents. Within the left
   are the largely secular and anti-war "Liberals", the socially
   conservative but economically left "Conservative Democrats", and the
   economically "Disadvantaged Democrats" who favor extended government
   assistance to the needy.^[5] In "the middle" are the optimistic and
   upwardly mobile "Upbeats", the discouraged and mistrusting
   "Disaffecteds," and the disenfranchised "Bystanders." The right
   compromises the highly pro-business "Enterprisers," the highly
   religious "Social Conservatives" (also known as the Christian right),
   and the "Pro-Government Conservatives" who are largely conservative on
   social issues but support government intervention to better their
   economic disposition.^[5]

Prominent ideologies[edit]

   Typological groups according to the Pew Research Center.

   Liberalism and conservatism are the most common ideologies in the U.S.
   apart from those who identify as moderate. Individuals embrace each
   ideology to widely varying extents. Liberals and progressives commonly
   advocate strong civil liberties, social progressivism, cultural
   pluralism, government ensuring of positive rights (education, health
   care, etc...) and a mixed economy.^[6] Conservatives commonly defend
   the notional status quo of some point in the past, believing that the
   Nation has deviated significantly from it and advocating more
   traditional stands on social issues, protection of gun rights and much
   less government intervention.^[5]

   Moderates, who may be left or right leaning, incorporate different
   aspects from liberalism and conservatism into their personal
   perspective. According to recent polls moderates are commonly
   identified as the second largest group, closely trailing conservatives,
   constituting between 36% and 39% of the population.^[7]^[8] Moderates
   are commonly defined through limiting the extent to which they adopt
   liberal and conservative ideas. CNN exit polls have found moderates to
   be rather evenly divided between the country's two main
   parties.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   Even though liberals as a whole tend to be the most educated
   ideological demographic (as indicated by Pew research), moderates tend
   to become increasingly conservative with increased economic
   prosperity,^[5] causing the professional class to be split between
   Republicans and Democrats.^[12] Among those who do identify as either
   liberal or conservative few identify as "far left" or "far right." Most
   Americans either identify as "moderate" or as "somewhat" liberal or
   conservative.^[7]

   While often not mentioned in major polls and less organized than
   liberal or conservatives, libertarians are a significant minority,
   constituting roughly 13% of the electorate. Libertarians commonly hold
   liberal views on social issues but conservative views on economic
   issues. Since the 1980s a majority of libertarians have favored the
   Republican Party, although in recent years, the margin favoring the
   Republicans has begun to shrink because of the libertarians' opposition
   to many recent Republican supported social issues.^[13]

Conservatism[edit]

   Main articles: Conservatism in the United States and New Right § United
   States

   In the United States modern conservatism coalesced in the latter half
   of the 20th century, responding over time to the political and social
   change associated with events such as the Great Depression, tension
   with the Soviet Union in the Cold War, the American Civil Rights
   Movement, the counterculture of the 1960s, the deregulation of the
   economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the overthrow of the New
   Deal Coalition in the 1980s, and the terrorist threat of the 21st
   century. Some of the most supported political issues among
   conservatives are economic liberalism, fiscal conservatism, and a form
   of social conservatism that is more appealing to the Christian Right.

   Conservatives tend to believe in a higher level of independence and
   self-reliance, and believe that the government should not get involved
   in private economic matters. Conservatives generally believe that
   having more economic freedom and a less social government will lead to
   a more responsible and efficient society. For this reason, most
   American conservatives believe in economic liberalism and fiscal
   conservatism.

   The word "conservative" comes from "conserve," hence describing those
   who generally wish to conserve the status quo, conserve morality, or
   conserve money. Views on individual policies vary among different
   sub-groups. Overall, a majority of conservatives support tax-cuts and
   other Laissez-faire(reduced governmental interference) policies, oppose
   same-sex marriage, oppose abortion, oppose stricter gun control laws on
   the grounds of the Second Amendment and public safety, and favor
   increased military spending as opposed to other federal expenditures.
   Conservatives tend to favor (racial) color-blindness and oppose
   affirmative action/positive discrimination quotas. Nationalist
   Conservatives are more likely to allow torture on suspected terrorists
   for interrogation, while some Social Conservatives oppose secularism
   and atheism in public schools. Conservatives tend to favor state
   governments over the federal, reserving the federal for matters of
   national security.

   Roughly one third, 36%, to 42%^[2] of the American public self-identify
   as "conservative." Conservatives commonly outnumber liberals in the
   general public with both ideological groupings being outnumbered by
   centrists.^[7] The military-industrial complex in particular remains a
   conservative bastion.^[14]^[15] A 2003 survey by the Military Times
   found that the "military considers itself clearly more conservative and
   Republican." In a December 2006 poll, 46% of active personnel
   identified as Republican, down from 60% in 2004.^[16] In the 2000, 2004
   and 2006 elections CNN exit polls found that roughly 80% of
   self-described conservatives voted Republican.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   A study by the Pew Research Center, where research assigned typological
   classifications based on responses to policy and ideological questions,
   found that a significant percentage of Democratic voters were social
   conservatives who only voted for the Democratic party due to their more
   left-leaning economic methods, as well as their longtime affiliation
   with the party especially among Dixiecrats and blacks. This study
   divided conservatives into four groups: Enterprisers, Social
   Conservatives, Pro-Government Conservatives, and Conservative
   Democrats. Of the conservative groups, Conservative Democrats were the
   most common typological group comprising 14% of respondents while
   Enterprisers and Pro-Government Conservatives were the least common
   among the conservative groups at 9%. Enterprisers had the second
   highest percentage of college graduates (46%) behind Liberals, and were
   tied with Liberals percentage wise on those who have household incomes
   of $75,000 or more (41%), while actually having a higher percentage of
   people who have household incomes of $50,000 or more (62%). All
   conservative demographics were religious with less than 10% of
   respondents identifying as "secular," compared to 22% among
   liberals.^[5]
   “ The value gaps for the GOP are, perhaps surprisingly, greatest with
     respect to the role of government. The Republicans' bigger tent now
     includes more lower-income voters than it once did, and many of these
     voters favor an activist government to help working class people.
     Government regulation to protect the environment is an issue with
     particular potential to divide Republicans. On this issue, wide
     divisions exist both within the GOP and among right-of-center voters
     more generally... Yet Republicans also have much in common beyond their
     overwhelming support for a muscular foreign policy and broad agreement
     on social issues. – Pew Research Center, 2005^[5]                      ”

Liberalism[edit]

   Main articles: Liberalism in the United States, Modern liberalism in
   the United States and Progressivism in the United States
   Opinions of liberals in a 2005 Pew Research Center study.^[17]

   Liberalism in the U.S. is most commonly characterized by a mixture of
   social liberalism and progressivism, with a strong (if frequently
   unrecognized) ordoliberal streak. Less frequently it may also describe
   forms of classic and neoliberalism. Liberals in the United States
   advocate strong civil liberties and social progressivism according to
   which societal practices need to be changed whenever necessary for the
   greater good of society or the benefits of those who wish to engage in
   those social arrangements. They believe that government action is
   needed in order for people to be as free as possible. Government must
   thereby ensure the provision of positive rights, protect civil
   liberties and ensure equality. American liberals commonly reject both
   laissez-faire capitalism and socialism as means to distribute economic
   resources. A mixed economy, that is a capitalist free market economy
   with limited government regulation and intervention is seen as the
   ideal. Recently, there has been a strong movement among liberals
   against corporate welfare, which is generally favored by pro-government
   conservatives. Cultural pluralism is quite common among American
   liberals.^[6]

   A majority of liberals favor diplomacy over military action, stem-cell
   research, the legalization of same-sex marriage, secular government,
   stricter gun control and environmental protection laws as well as the
   preservation of abortion rights. They tend to be rather divided on free
   trade agreements and organizations such as the North American Free
   Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Most liberals oppose increased military
   standing and the display of the Ten Commandments in public buildings.
   Immigration and cultural diversity is deemed positive. As a result
   liberals favor cultural pluralism, a system in which immigrants retain
   aspects of their native culture in addition to adopting their new
   culture.
   “ Liberalism wagers that a state... can be strong but constrained –
     strong because constrained... Rights to education and other
     requirements for human development and security aim to advance equal
     opportunity and personal dignity and to promote a creative and
     productive society. To guarantee those rights, liberals have supported
     a wider social and economic role for the state, counterbalanced by more
     robust guarantees of civil liberties and a wider social system of
     checks and balances anchored in an independent press and pluralistic
     society. – Paul Starr, sociologist at Princeton University, The New
     Republic, March 2007                                                   ”

   According to the Pew Research Center liberals are particularly
   distinguished from any other typographic group by their socially
   progressive viewpoints. In 2004, liberals were the only group to
   advocate same sex marriage and euthanasia, policies regarded as left of
   the Democratic Party. Among the most prominent liberal periodicals are
   The Nation, The American Prospect, and The New Republic. The New
   Republic described its political standing, giving a brief overview of
   contemporary American liberalism, in a June 2006 editorial stating it
   was "very much against the Bush tax programs, against Bush Social
   Security 'reform,' against cutting the inheritance tax, for radical
   health care changes, passionate about Gore-type environmentalism, for a
   woman's entitlement to an abortion, for gay marriage, for an increase
   in the minimum wage, for pursuing aggressively alternatives to our
   present reliance on oil and our present tax preferences for
   gas-guzzling automobiles."^[18]
   “ [Liberals are] Predominantly white (83%), most highly educated group
     (49% have a college degree or more), and youngest group after
     Bystanders. Least religious group in typology: 43% report they seldom
     or never attend religious services; nearly a quarter (22%) are
     seculars. More than one-third never married (36%). Largest group
     residing in urban areas (42%) and in the western half the country
     (34%). Wealthiest Democratic group (41% earn at least $75,000). – Pew
     Research Center                                                        ”

   Roughly 19% to 26% of the American public is liberal depending on
   survey and method.^[7] Liberals vote mostly in favor of the Democratic
   Party, constituting roughly 43% of the Democratic
   base.^[5]^[9]^[10]^[11] Liberalism tends to be most prominent in
   academia and among those with higher levels of education.^[19] In 2004,
   72% of full-time faculty members at four-year colleges identified as
   liberal.^[20] In a 2004 survey of 1,000 economists, registered
   Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans by a 2.5 to 1 ratio. The
   majority of economists favored "safety regulations, gun control,
   redistribution, public schooling, and anti-discrimination laws", while
   opposing "tighter immigration controls, government ownership of
   enterprise and tariffs."^[21] Among sociologists and anthropologists,
   Democrats outnumber Republicans 20 to 1.^[22]

   Over the past decades,^[when?] the political outlook of Americans has
   become more progressive, with those below the age of thirty being
   considerably more liberal than the overall population. According to
   recent polls, 56% of those age 18 to 29 favor gay marriage, 68% state
   environmental protection to be as important as job creation, 52% "think
   immigrants 'strengthen the country with their hard work and talents,'"
   62% favor a "tax financed, government-administrated universal health
   care" program and 74% "say 'people's will' should have more influence
   on U.S. laws than the Bible, compared to 37%, 49%, 38%, 47% and 58%
   among the general population.^[23]
   “ [Enterprisers are] Predominantly white (91%), male (76%) and
     financially well-off (62% have household incomes of at least $50,000,
     compared with 40% nationwide). Nearly half (46%) have a college degree,
     and 77% are married. Nearly a quarter (23%) are themselves military
     veterans. Only 10% are under age 30. – Pew Research Center, 2005       ”
   “ [Social Conservatives are] Predominantly white (91%), female (58%)
     and the oldest of all groups (average age is 52; 47% are 50 or older);
     nearly half live in the South. Most (53%) attend church weekly; 43% are
     white evangelical Protestants (double the national average of 21%). –
     Pew Research Center, 2005                                              ”
   “ [Pro-Government Conservatives are] Predominately female (62%) and
     relatively young; highest percentage of minority members of any
     Republican-leaning group (10% black, 12% Hispanic). Most (59%) have no
     more than a high school diploma. Poorer than other Republican groups;
     nearly half (49%) have household incomes of less than $30,000 (about on
     par with Disadvantaged Democrats). Nearly half (47%) are parents of
     children living at home; 42% live in the South. – Pew Research Center,
     2005                                                                    ”
   “ Older women and blacks make up a sizeable proportion of [Conservative
     Democrats] (27% and 30%, respectively). Somewhat less educated and
     poorer than the nation overall. Allegiance to the Democratic Party is
     quite strong (51% describe themselves as "strong" Democrats) but fully
     85% describe themselves as either conservative or moderate
     ideologically. – Pew Research Center, 2005                             ”

   It is also shown by the Pew Research Center that conservatives tend to
   have stronger belief in personal empowerment than liberals. Among the
   wealthiest and most educated group of conservatives, the Enterprisers,
   95% believed that most people can get ahead in life if they work hard.
   Despite having similar income and education levels, only 53% of
   Liberals agreed with Enterprisers on the issue while 39% disagreed and
   another 5% refused to answer.^[24] Even among the poorest and least
   educated groups of both the conservatives (the Pro-Government
   Conservatives) and the left-wing (the Disadvantaged Democrats), these
   differences in opinion about personal empowerment are apparent. While
   74% of Pro-Government Conservatives believed that people can get ahead
   with hard work, only 14% of Disadvantaged Democrats agreed while 79%
   disagreed and the other 7% refused to answer.^[25]

Demographics of ideological groups[edit]

   Further information: Demography of the United States
   Percent of all survey respondents, voters and college graduates by
   typological demographic.^[17]

Education and income[edit]

   The socially progressive Liberals and staunchly conservative
   Enterprisers are tied as the two most affluent groups, while Liberals
   are the most educated. Liberals have a slightly higher percentage of
   college graduates than Enterprisers; 49% of versus 46% of Enterprisers.
   Bystanders, those who chose not to participate in the political
   process, have the least percentage of college graduates (11%) and are
   tied with Disadvantaged Democrats as the most financially
   distressed.^[5]

   Generally, education and affluence increase the chances of an
   individual to be politically active. The professional class, which is
   relatively evenly divided among Democrats and Republicans,^[12] is
   among the most politically active,^[26] while those in the lower class
   – the working poor and underclass – commonly abstain from taking part
   in the political process.^[27] The working class has become less
   politically active, partially due to a decline in the prevalence of
   labor unions.^[28] As a result, the American electorate is considerably
   more affluent and educated than the general population. In the 2006
   mid-term elections, for example, those with graduate degrees, who
   constitute 9% of the general population age 25 or older, comprised 16%
   of the electorate.^[11] All sizable socio-economic groups were
   relatively split between the two major parties in the 2000, 2004 and
   2006 elections.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   Education, up to the undergraduate level, increased a person's chances
   of him or her voting Republican. The contradiction is explained through
   moderate voters who tend to become more conservative as they become
   more economically prosperous.^[5] At the post-graduate level, liberals
   outnumber conservatives and a majority commonly votes
   Democratic.^[9]^[10]^[11]

Religion and marital status[edit]

   Ideological groups are distinguished by certain societal attributes,
   such as religion, marital status, education, and gun ownership, yet are
   relatively similar in terms of race and ethnicity. Generally liberals
   were more likely to be secular, single and in possession of a college
   degree, while less likely to own a gun.^[citation needed]
   Conservatives, most of whom adhere to social as well as fiscal
   conservatism, tended to be far more religious and more likely to be
   married and own firearms.^[citation needed]

   The majority of Social Conservatives and Pro-Government Conservatives
   attended church services once a week.^[citation needed] Weekly
   churchgoers were also in the plurality among the general population and
   all ideological demographics, except liberals.^[citation needed] Of
   liberals, a plurality, 43% attended church services "seldom or never,"
   compared to 25% of respondents overall.^[citation needed] Conservatives
   were also more likely to be married than Liberals or the Democratic
   voter base in general. The vast majority, 77% of Enterprisers were
   married compared to 44% of Liberals.^[citation needed]

   Disadvantaged and Conservative Democrats had the highest union
   membership rates, 23% and 18%, compared to an overall 14%,
   respectively, as well as the highest percentage of minorities
   (Disadvantaged Democrats 55% Black, Hispanic, and Other; Conservative
   Democrats 46% Black, Hispanic, and Other).^[citation needed]In terms of
   gun ownership, the majority of Enterprisers and Social Conservatives
   had a gun at home, compared to just 23% of Liberals.^[citation needed]
   Liberals were the most educated group with 49% being college graduates
   compared to an average of 26.5% among all the conservative groups
   (including the Democratic voting Conservative Democrats).^[citation
   needed] Disadvantaged Democrats were the least educated with only 13%
   having a college degree.^[citation needed]

Race[edit]

   In terms of race, conservatives and liberals were fairly similar with
   more than 80% identifying as white and having been born in the United
   States. However, Republican voting conservatives like Enterprisers,
   Social Conservatives, and Pro-Government Conservatives had a higher
   white percentage than liberals, especially Enterprisers and Social
   Conservatives who were both 91% white compared to 83% of Liberals.
   Liberals were also the most likely of every group to be born outside of
   the United States with 20% of liberal respondents saying that they or
   their parents were born outside of the United States, while only around
   12% of all conservative types answered "yes" to the same question.^[17]
