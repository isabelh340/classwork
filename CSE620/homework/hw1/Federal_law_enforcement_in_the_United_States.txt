Overview[edit]

   Federal law enforcement authorities have authority, given to them under
   various parts of the United States Code (U.S.C.). Federal law
   enforcement officers enforce various laws, generally at only the
   federal level. There are exceptions, with some agencies and officials
   enforcing state and tribal codes. Most are limited by the U.S. Code to
   investigating matters that are explicitly within the power of the
   federal government. Some federal investigative powers have become
   broader in practice, since the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act in
   October 2001.

   The Department of Justice was formerly the largest, and remains, as of
   2014, most prominent collection of law enforcement agencies, and
   handled most law enforcement duties at the federal level.^[1] It
   includes the United States Marshals Service (USMS), the Federal Bureau
   of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and
   the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Federal
   Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and others. In 2002, the Department of
   Homeland Security (DHS) was created by an act of Congress.

   There is also U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) which includes
   the Office of Air and Marine, the Office of Border Patrol, and the
   Office of Field Operations. CBP's components have the primary
   responsibility of enforcing customs and immigration laws at and between
   the ports of entry of the United States; the Federal Protective Service
   (FPS) is responsible for federal law enforcement in federal buildings
   and properties. Including elements of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S.
   Transportation Security Administration, DHS now has more sworn armed
   federal law enforcement agents and officers than any other department
   of the United States government.

   While the majority of federal law enforcement employees work for the
   departments of Justice and Homeland Security, there are dozens of other
   federal law enforcement agencies under the other executive departments,
   as well as under the legislative and judicial branches of the federal
   government.

History[edit]

   Federal law enforcement in the United States is well over two hundred
   years old. For example, the Postal Inspection Service can trace its
   origins back to 1772.^[2]
