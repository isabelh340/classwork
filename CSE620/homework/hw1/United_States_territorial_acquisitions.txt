1783–1853[edit]

   Map of current U.S. states that are direct successor states of the
   original Thirteen Colonies that declared independence from Great
   Britain in 1776. Indirect successor states (Maine, Kentucky, West
   Virginia), the District of Columbia and states that acceded to the
   union after the American Revolutionary War are not included
   National Atlas map (circa 2005) depicting territorial acquisitions.
   A government map, probably created in the mid-20th century, that
   depicts a simplified history of territorial acquisitions within the
   continental United States

   The 1783 Treaty of Paris with Great Britain defined the original
   borders of the United States. There were ambiguities in the treaty
   regarding the exact border with Canada that led to disputes that were
   resolved by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842.^[1]

Louisiana[edit]

   The Louisiana Purchase in 1803, was negotiated with Napoleon during the
   presidency of Thomas Jefferson; the territory was acquired from France
   for 15 million (equivalent to $236 million in present day terms). A
   small portion of this land was ceded to Britain in 1818 in exchange for
   the Red River Basin. More of this land was ceded to Spain in 1819 with
   the Florida Purchase, but was later reacquired through Texas annexation
   and Mexican Cession.^[2]

West Florida[edit]

   West Florida was declared to be a U.S. possession in 1810 by President
   James Madison. The Army then took control of that new nation 91 days
   after it had declared its independence from Spain.^[3]

Red River[edit]

   The parts of Rupert's Land and the Red River Colony south of the 49th
   parallel in the basin of the Red River of the North were acquired in
   1818 from Britain under the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.

East Florida[edit]

   The Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819 with Spain resulted in Spain's cession of
   East Florida and the Sabine Free State and Spain's surrender of any
   claims to the Oregon Country. Article III of the treaty, when properly
   surveyed, resulted in the acquisition of a small part of central
   Colorado.^[4]

Along Canadian border[edit]

   Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 with Britain split the disputed
   territory in Maine and New Brunswick and finalized the border with
   Canada,^[5] including the disputed Indian Stream territory. In 1850
   Britain ceded to the U.S. less than one acre of underwater rock
   (Horseshoe Reef) in Lake Erie near Buffalo for a lighthouse.^[6]

Texas[edit]

   Texas Annexation of 1845: The independent Republic of Texas long sought
   to join the U.S., despite Mexican claims and the warning by Mexican
   leader Antonio López de Santa Anna that this would be "equivalent to a
   declaration of war against the Mexican Republic." Congress approved the
   annexation of Texas on February 28, 1845. On December 29, 1845, Texas
   became the 28th state. Texas had claimed New Mexico east of the Rio
   Grande but had only made one unsuccessful attempt to occupy it; New
   Mexico was captured by the U.S. Army in August 1846 and then
   administered separately from Texas. Mexico acknowledged the loss of
   territory in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848

Oregon[edit]

   Oregon Country, the area of North America west of the Rockies to the
   Pacific, was jointly controlled by the U.S. and Britain following the
   Anglo-American Convention of 1818 until June 15, 1846 when the Oregon
   Treaty divided the territory at the 49th parallel (see Oregon boundary
   dispute). The San Juan Islands were claimed and jointly occupied by the
   U.S. and the U.K. from 1846–72 due to ambiguities in the treaty (see
   Northwestern Boundary Dispute). Arbitration led to the sole U.S.
   possession of the San Juan Islands since 1872.

Mexican Cession[edit]

   Mexican Cession lands were captured in the Mexican-American War in
   1846–48, and ceded by Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, where
   Mexico agreed to the present Mexico – United States border except for
   the later Gadsden Purchase. The United States paid $15 million
   (equivalent to $380 million in present day terms) and agreed to pay
   claims made by American citizens against Mexico which amounted to more
   than $3 million (equivalent to $76 million today).

Gadsden Purchase[edit]

   Gadsden Purchase of 1853, United States purchased a strip of land along
   the U.S.-Mexico border for $10 million (equivalent to $283 million in
   present day terms), now in New Mexico and Arizona. This territory was
   intended for a southern transcontinental railroad.

Since 1853[edit]

Alaska[edit]

   Alaska Purchase from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million (2 cents per
   acre)^[7] on March 30, 1867 (equivalent to $121 million in present day
   terms), as a vital refueling station for ships trading with Asia. The
   land went through several administrative changes before becoming an
   organized territory on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S. on
   January 3, 1959.

Hawaii[edit]

   Hawaii and Outlying Islands
     * In 1959, 94% of Hawaii's residents voted to relinquish all land
       claims (proposition 2) to the United States and become a state.
     * Today's United States Minor Outlying Islands excluding Caribbean

   The Kingdom of Hawaii was closely linked by missionary work and trade
   to the U.S. by the 1880s. In 1893 business leaders overthrew the Queen
   and sought annexation. President Grover Cleveland strongly disapproved,
   so Hawaii set up an independent republic. Southern Democrats in
   Congress strongly opposed a non-white addition. President William
   McKinley, a Republican, secured a Congressional resolution in 1898, and
   the small republic joined the U.S. All its citizens became full U.S.
   citizens. One factor was the need for advanced naval bases to fend off
   Japanese ambitions. The Hawaiian Islands officially became a territory
   of the U.S. in 1900. Following 94% voter approval of the Admission of
   Hawaii Act, on August 21, 1959 the Territory of Hawaii became the state
   of Hawaii, the 50th state.

   With Hawaii came the Palmyra Atoll which had been annexed by the U.S.
   in 1859 but later abandoned, then later claimed by Hawaii.

Spanish colonies[edit]

   Post-Spanish-American War map of "Greater America".
   Main article: Spanish-American War

   Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines (for which the United States
   compensated Spain $20 million, equivalent to $567 million in present
   day terms), ceded by Spain after the Spanish-American War in the 1898
   Treaty of Paris. Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over Cuba,
   but did not cede it to the United States, so it became a protectorate.
   All four of these areas were under United States Military Government
   (USMG) for extended periods. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902,
   and the Philippines became an independent nation in 1946.

   This era also saw the first scattered protests against American
   imperialism. Noted Americans such as Mark Twain spoke out forcefully
   against these ventures. Opponents of the war, including Twain and
   Andrew Carnegie, organized themselves into the American
   Anti-Imperialist League.

   During this same period the American people continued to strongly
   chastise the European powers for their imperialism. The Second Boer War
   was especially unpopular in the United States and soured Anglo-American
   relations. The anti-imperialist press would often draw parallels
   between the U.S. in the Philippines and the British in the Second Boer
   War.^[8]

Cuba[edit]

   Under the 1898 Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished all claim of
   sovereignty over and title to Cuba, with the island to be occupied by
   the United States. Under the Teller Amendment Congress had already
   decided against annexation. Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May
   1902. Under the new Cuban constitution, however, the U.S. retained the
   right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and
   foreign relations through the Platt Amendment;^[9] this, however, was
   later renounced as part of Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor
   Policy.^[9] Under the Platt Amendment (1901), Cuba also agreed to lease
   to the U.S. the naval base at Guantánamo Bay. The naval base occupies
   land which the United States leased from Cuba in 1903 "... for the time
   required for the purposes of coaling and naval stations." The two
   governments later agreed that, "So long as the United States of America
   shall not abandon the said naval station of Guantanamo or the two
   Governments shall not agree to a modification of its present limits,
   the station shall continue to have the territorial area that it now
   has, with the limits that it has on the date of the signature of the
   present Treaty."^[10]^[11]

Puerto Rico[edit]

   On July 25, 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was
   invaded by the United States with a landing at Guánica. As an outcome
   of the war, Jones-Shafroth Act granted all the inhabitants of Puerto
   Rico U.S. citizenship in 1917. The U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right
   to democratically elect their own governor in 1948. In 1950, the Truman
   Administration allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to
   determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local
   constitution without affecting the unincorporated territory status with
   the U.S.^[12] A local constitution was approved by a Constitutional
   Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved
   by President Truman on July 3 of that year, and proclaimed by Gov.
   Muñoz Marín on July 25, 1952, the anniversary of the 1898 arrival of
   U.S. troops. Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado
   (literally translated as "Free Associated State"), officially
   translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body
   politic.^[13]^[14]

Guam[edit]

   In Guam, settlement by foreign ethnic groups was small at first. After
   World War II showed the strategic value of the island, construction of
   a huge military base began along with a large influx of people from
   other parts of the world. Guam today has a very mixed population of
   164,000. The indigenous Chamorros make up 37% of the population. The
   rest of the population consists mostly of Whites and Filipinos, with
   smaller groups of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Micronesians, Vietnamese
   and Indians. Guam today is almost totally Americanized. The situation
   is somewhat similar to that in Hawaii, but attempts to change Guam's
   status as an 'unincorporated' U.S. territory have yet to meet with
   success.

Philippines[edit]

   Main articles: History of the Philippines (1898-1946) and
   Philippine-American War

   The Philippine Revolution against Spain began in April 1896. The
   Spanish-American War came to the Philippines on May 1, 1898, when the
   United States Navy's Asiatic Squadron, commanded by Commodore George
   Dewey, defeated the Spanish Pacific Squadron under Admiral Patricio
   Montojo y Pasarón during the Battle of Manila Bay. On June 12,
   Philippine revolutionaries declared independence and establishment of
   the First Philippine Republic. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of
   Paris which ended the Spanish-American war was signed. The treaty
   transferred control of the Philippines from Spain to the United States.
   This agreement was not recognized by the Philippine revolutionaries,
   who declared war against the United States on June 2, 1899.^[15] The
   Philippine-American War ensued. In 1901, Emilio Aguinaldo, president of
   the Malolos Republic, was captured and pledged his allegiance to the
   American government.^[16] The U.S. unilaterally declared an end to the
   conflict in 1902. Scattered fighting continued, however, until 1913.

   The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 provided for the establishment of a
   bicameral legislature composed of an upper house consisting of the
   Philippine Commission, an appointed body with both American and
   Filipino members. and a popularly elected lower house, the Philippine
   Assembly. The Philippines became a U.S. colony in the fashion of
   Europe's New Imperialism^[citation needed], with benevolent colonial
   practices. English joined Spanish as an official language, and English
   language education was made compulsory. In 1916, the United States
   passed the Philippine Autonomy Act and committed itself to granting
   independence to the Philippines, "...as soon as a stable government can
   be established therein."^[17] As a step to full independence in 1946,
   partial autonomy as a Commonwealth was granted in 1935.

   Preparation for a fully sovereign state was interrupted by the Japanese
   occupation of the Philippines during World War II. The United States
   suffered a total of 62,514 casualties, including 13,973 deaths in its
   attempt to liberate the Philippines from Imperial Japanese rule during
   the hard-fought Philippines campaign from 1944-1945. Full independence
   came with the recognition of Philippine sovereignty by the U.S. in
   1946.

Wake Island[edit]

   Wake Island was annexed as empty territory by the United States in 1899
   (the claim is currently disputed by the Marshall Islands).

American Samoa[edit]

   Germany, the United States, and Britain colonized the Samoan Islands.
   The nations came into conflict in the Second Samoan Civil War and the
   nations resolved their issues, establishing American Samoa as per the
   Treaty of Berlin, 1899. The U.S. took control of its allotted region on
   June 7, 1900, with the Deed of Cession. Tutuila Island and Aunuu Island
   were ceded by their chiefs in 1900, then added to American Samoa. Manua
   was annexed in 1904, then added to American Samoa. Swains Island was
   annexed in 1925 (occupied since 1856), then added to American Samoa.
   (The claim is currently disputed by Tokelau, a colonial territory of
   New Zealand.) American Samoa was under the control of the U.S. Navy
   from 1900 to 1951. American Samoa was made a formal territory in 1929.
   From 1951 until 1977, Territorial Governors were appointed by the
   Secretary of the Interior. Immigration of Americans was never as strong
   as it was, for instance, in Hawaii; indigenous Samoans make up 89% of
   the population. The islands have been reluctant to separate from the
   U.S. in any manner.

Panama Canal Zone[edit]

   The Panama Canal Zone was an unorganized US territory located within
   the Republic of Panama. It was established under the Hay–Bunau-Varilla
   Treaty in 1903 and disestablished in 1979 under the Torrijos–Carter
   Treaties. Panama gained full control over the Panama Canal in 1999.

Virgin Islands[edit]

   Main article: United States Virgin Islands

   In 1917, the United States purchased the former Danish colony of St.
   Croix, St. John and St. Thomas, which is now the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   The United States - which had made an earlier approach in 1902
   -purchased these islands because they feared that the islands might be
   seized as a submarine base during World War I. After several months of
   secret negotiations, a sales price of $25 million was agreed. A
   non-binding referendum in Denmark held in late 1916 confirmed the
   decision to sell by a wide margin. The U.S. took possession of the
   islands on March 31, 1917 a few days before the U.S entered the war.
   The deal was ratified and finalized on January 17, 1917, when the
   United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty
   ratifications. The territory was renamed the U.S. Virgin Islands.^[18]
   U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.

Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands[edit]

   The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) was a United Nations
   trust territory in Micronesia (western Pacific) administered by the
   United States from July 18, 1947, comprising the former League of
   Nations Mandate administered by Japan and taken by the U.S. in 1944.
   The various island groupings in the Trust Territory were later divided
   up. The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia
   achieved independence on October 21, 1986. Palau did so in 1994. All
   three nations signed Compacts of Free Association with the United
   States.

Mexican boundary[edit]

     * The Boundary Treaty of 1970 transferred 823 acres (3.33 km^2) of
       Mexican territory to the U.S., in areas near Presidio and Hidalgo,
       Texas, to build flood control channels. In exchange, the U.S. ceded
       2,177 acres (8.81 km^2) to Mexico, including five parcels near
       Presidio, the Horcon Tract containing the little town of Rio Rico,
       Texas, and Beaver Island near Roma, Texas. The last of these
       transfers occurred in 1977.
     * On November 24, 2009, the U.S. ceded 6 islands in the Rio Grande to
       Mexico, totaling 107.81 acres (0.4363 km^2). At the same time,
       Mexico ceded 3 islands and 2 cuts to the U.S., totaling 63.53 acres
       (0.2571 km^2). This transfer, which had been pending for 20 years,
       was the first application of Article III of the 1970 Boundary
       Treaty.

     * The Chamizal Treaty of 1963, which ended a hundred-year dispute
       between the two countries near El Paso, Texas, transferred 630
       acres (2.5 km^2) from the U.S. to Mexico in 1967. In return, Mexico
       transferred 264 acres (1.07 km^2) to the U.S.

     * The Rio Grande Rectification Treaty of 1933 straightened and
       stabilized the 155 miles (249 km) of river boundary through the
       highly developed El Paso-Juárez Valley. Numerous parcels of land
       (174) were transferred between the two countries during the
       construction period, 1935 – 1938. At the end, each nation had ceded
       an equal area of land (2,560.5 acres (10.362 km^2)) to the other.
     * The Banco Convention of 1905 resulted in many exchanges of bancos
       (land surrounded by bends in the river that became segregated from
       either country by a cutoff, often due to rapid accretion or
       avulsion of the alluvial channel) between the two nations, most
       often in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Under the treaty, the
       following transfers involving Texas occurred from 1910 – 1976:^[19]

     * In 1927 under the same 1905 Convention, the U.S. acquired two
       bancos from Mexico at the Colorado River border with Arizona.
       Farmers Banco, covering 583.4 acres (2.361 km^2), a part of the

       became U.S. soil.
     * Proposed: Based on aerial surveys in 2008, there are 138 cases
       where the widest channel of normal flow of the Rio Grande has
       shifted from previous surveys. Therefore, the International
       Boundary Line is to be changed under Article III of the 1970
       Boundary Treaty. The result is 138 proposed transfers of territory
       that remain pending further evaluation and approval by the
       International Boundary and Water Commission and the two
       governments. Upon resolution, the U.S. is to cede 7 islands and 60
       cuts in the Rio Grande to Mexico, totaling 1,251.2 acres
       (5.063 km^2), while Mexico is to cede 3 islands and 68 cuts to the
       U.S., totaling 1,275.9 acres (5.163 km^2).

Canada[edit]

   In 1925, to correct an unintended effect from an earlier treaty, the
   U.S. ceded to Canada two enclaves comprising two and one-half acres of
   water territory in the Lake of the Woods.^[6]^[21]

Northern Mariana Islands[edit]

   The Northern Mariana Islands were part of the former Trust Territory of
   the Pacific Islands but decided in the 1970s not to seek independence.
   The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in political union
   with the United States was established in 1978.
