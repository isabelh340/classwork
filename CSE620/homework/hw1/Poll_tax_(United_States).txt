   Receipt for payment of poll tax, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, 1917 (the
   $1 tax would be equal to $18.41 today)

   In U.S. practice, a poll tax was used as a de facto or implicit
   pre-condition of the exercise of the ability to vote. This tax emerged
   in some states of the United States in the late 19th century as part of
   the Jim Crow laws. After the ability to vote was extended to all races
   by the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment, many Southern states
   enacted poll tax laws as a means of restricting eligible voters; such
   laws often included a grandfather clause, which allowed any adult male
   whose father or grandfather had voted in a specific year prior to the
   abolition of slavery to vote without paying the tax. These laws, along
   with unfairly implemented literacy tests and extra-legal
   intimidation,^[1] achieved the desired effect of disfranchising
   African-American and Native American voters, as well as poor whites.

   Although largely associated with states of the former Confederacy, poll
   taxes were also in place in other states. For instance, California had
   a poll tax until 1914 when it was abolished through a popular
   referendum.

   Initially, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of Breedlove v.
   Suttles, 302 U.S. 277 (1937), found the poll tax to be constitutional.
   The 24th Amendment, ratified in 1964, reflecting a political
   compromise, abolished the use of the poll tax (or any other tax) as a
   pre-condition for voting in federal elections, but made no mention of
   poll taxes in state elections.

   In the 1966 case of Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, the Supreme
   Court overruled its decision in Breedlove v. Suttles, and extended the
   prohibition of poll taxes to state elections. It declared that the
   imposition of a poll tax in state elections violated the Equal
   Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States
   Constitution.

   The Harper ruling was one of several that rely on the Equal Protection
   clause of the 14th Amendment rather than the more direct provision of
   the 15th Amendment. In a two-month period in the spring of 1966,
   Federal courts declared unconstitutional poll tax laws in the last four
   states to have them, starting with Texas on 9 February. Decisions
   followed for Alabama (3 March) and Virginia (25 March). Mississippi's
   $2.00 poll tax (equal to $14.54 in 2013) was the last to fall, declared
   unconstitutional on 8 April 1966, by a federal panel in Jackson,
   Mississippi.^[2] Virginia attempted to partially abolish its poll tax
   by requiring a residence certification, but the Supreme Court did not
   accept this.
