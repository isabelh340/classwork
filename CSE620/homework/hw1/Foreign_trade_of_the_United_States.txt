   Foreign trade of the United States comprises the international imports
   and exports of the United States, one of the world's most significant
   economic markets. The country is among the top three global importers
   and exporters.

   The regulation of trade is constitutionally vested in the United States
   Congress. After the Great Depression, the country emerged as among the
   most significant global trade policy-makers, and it is now a partner to
   a number of international trade agreements, including the General
   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Trade
   Organization (ITO). Gross U.S. assets held by foreigners were $16.3
   trillion as of the end of 2006 (over 100% of GDP).

History[edit]

   See also: American Civil War

   The Constitution gives Congress express power over the imposition of
   tariffs and the regulation of international trade. As a result,
   Congress can enact laws including those that: establish tariff rates;
   implement trade agreements; provide remedies against unfairly traded
   imports; control exports of sensitive technology; and extend tariff
   preferences to imports from developing countries. Over time, and under
   carefully prescribed circumstances, Congress has delegated some of its
   trade authority to the Executive Branch. Congress, however, has, in
   some cases, kept tight reins on the use of this authority by requiring
   that certain trade laws and programs be renewed; and by requiring the
   Executive Branch to issue reports to Congress to monitor the
   implementation of the trade laws and programs.^[1]

   The authority of Congress to regulate international trade is set out in
   Article I, Section 8, Paragraph 1 of the United States Constitution:

     The Congress shall have power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties,
     Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common
     Defence and to promote the general Welfare of the United States; but
     all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the
     United States;

   Embargo Act of 1807 was designed to force Britain to rescind its
   restrictions on American trade, but failed, and was repealed in early
   1809.

   During the Civil War period, leaders of the Confederacy were confident
   that Britain would come to their aid because of British reliance on
   Southern cotton.^[2] The Union was able to avoid this, through skillful
   use of diplomacy and threats to other aspects of European-U.S. trade
   relations.

   While the United States has always participated in international trade,
   it did not take a leading role in global trade policy-making until the
   Great Depression. Congress and The Executive Branch came into conflict
   in deciding the mix of trade promotion and protectionism. In order to
   stimulate employment, Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
   Act of 1934, allowing the executive branch to negotiate bilateral trade
   agreements for a fixed period of time.^[citation needed] During the
   1930s the amount of bilateral negotiation under this act was fairly
   limited, and consequently did little to expand global tade.

   Near the end of the Second World War U.S. policy makers began to
   experiment on a broader level. In the 1940s, working with the British
   government, the United States developed two innovations to expand and
   govern trade among nations: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
   (GATT) and the International Trade Organization (ITO). GATT was a
   temporary multilateral agreement designed to provide a framework of
   rules and a forum to negotiate trade barrier reductions among nations.

   The growing importance of international trade led to the establishment
   of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 1963 by Executive
   Order 11075, originally called The Office of the Special Representative
   for Trade Negotiations.^[3]

Trade policy[edit]

   Deteriorating U.S. net international investment position (NIIP) has
   caused concern among economists over the effects of outsourcing and
   high U.S. trade deficits over the long-run.^[4]
   United States balance of trade (1980–2012), with negative numbers
   denoting a trade deficit

   United States trade policy has varied widely through various American
   historical and industrial periods. As a major developed nation, the
   U.S. has relied heavily on the import of raw materials and the export
   of finished goods. Because of the significance for American economy and
   industry, much weight has been placed on trade policy by elected
   officials and business leaders.^[5]

   The 1920s marked a decade of economic growth in the United States
   following a Classical supply side policy.^[6] U.S. President Warren
   Harding signed the Emergency Tariff of 1921 and the Fordney–McCumber
   Tariff of 1922. Harding's policies reduced taxes and protected U.S.
   business and agriculture.^[7] Following the Great Depression and World
   War II, the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference brought
   the Bretton Woods currency agreement followed by the economy of the
   1950s and 1960s. In 1971, President Richard Nixon ended U.S. ties to
   Bretton Woods, leaving the U.S. with a floating fiat currency. The
   stagflation of the 1970s saw a U.S. economy characterized by slower GDP
   growth. In 1988, the United States ranked first in the world in the
   Economist Intelligence Unit "quality of life index" and third in the
   Economic Freedom of the World Index.^[8]

   Over the long run, nations with trade surpluses tend also to have a
   savings surplus. The U.S. generally has developed lower savings rates
   than its trading partners, which have tended to have trade surpluses.
   Germany, France, Japan, and Canada have maintained higher savings rates
   than the U.S. over the long run.^[9]

   Some economists believe that GDP and employment can be dragged down by
   an over-large deficit over the long run.^[10]^[11] Others believe that
   trade deficits are good for the economy.^[12] The opportunity cost of a
   forgone tax base may outweigh perceived gains, especially where
   artificial currency pegs and manipulations are present to distort
   trade.^[13]

   In 2006, the primary economic concerns focused on: high national debt
   ($9 trillion), high non-bank corporate debt ($9 trillion), high
   mortgage debt ($9 trillion), high financial institution debt ($12
   trillion), high unfunded Medicare liability ($30 trillion), high
   unfunded Social Security liability ($12 trillion), high external debt
   (amount owed to foreign lenders) and a serious deterioration in the
   United States net international investment position (NIIP) (-24% of
   GDP),^[4] high trade deficits, and a rise in illegal
   immigration.^[14]^[15]

   These issues have raised concerns among economists and unfunded
   liabilities were mentioned as a serious problem facing the United
   States in the President's 2006 State of the Union address.^[15]^[16] On
   June 26, 2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the
   U.S. to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the
   workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much in some
   areas and can no longer rely on the financial sector and consumer
   spending to drive demand.^[17]

   In 1985, the U.S.had just began a growing trade deficit with China.
   During the 1990s, U.S. trade deficit became a more excessive long-run
   trade deficit, mostly with Asia. By 2012, the U.S. trade deficit,
   fiscal budget deficit, and federal debt increased to record or near
   record levels following accompanying decades of the implementation of
   broad unconditional or unilateral U.S. free trade policies and formal
   trade agreements.^[18]^[19]

   The US last had a trade surplus in 1975.^[20] However, recessions may
   cause short-run anomalies to rising trade deficits. The balance of
   trade in the United States has been a concern among economists and
   business people. Warren Buffett, founder of Berkshire Hathaway, was
   quoted in the Associated Press (January 20, 2006) as saying "The U.S
   trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either
   the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political
   turmoil... Right now, the rest of the world owns $3 trillion more of us
   than we own of them."

   In both a 1987 guest editorial to the Omaha-World Herald and a more
   detailed 2003 Fortune article, Buffett proposed a tool called Import
   Certificates as a solution to the United States' problem and ensure
   balanced trade. "The rest of the world owns a staggering $2.5 trillion
   more of the U.S. than we own of other countries. Some of this $2.5
   trillion is invested in claim checks—U.S. bonds, both governmental and
   private— and some in such assets as property and equity
   securities."^[21]

   Today the United States' largest trading partner is China. China has
   seen substantial economic growth in the past 50 years and though a
   nuclear-security summit that took place in early 2010 president Obama
   hoped to insure another 50 years of growth between the two countries.
   On April 19, 2010, President Barack Obama met with China's President Hu
   Jintao to discuss trade policies between the two countries.^[22]

Customs territory[edit]

   The main customs territory of the United States includes the 50 states,
   the District of Columbia, and the territory of Puerto Rico, with the
   exception of over 200 foreign trade zones designated to encourage
   economic activity. People and goods entering this territory are subject
   to inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The remaining
   insular areas are separate customs territories administered largely by
   local authorities:
     * American Samoa
     * Guam
     * Northern Mariana Islands
     * United States Minor Outlying Islands (mostly uninhabited)
     * United States Virgin Islands

   Transportation of certain living things or agricultural products may be
   prohibited even within a customs territory. This is enforced by U.S.
   Customs and Border Protection, the federal Animal and Plant Health
   Inspection Service, and even state authorities such as the California
   Department of Food and Agriculture.

Investment in the United States[edit]

   Account balance as of 2006^[23]

   Gross U.S. assets held by foreigners were $16.3 trillion as of the end
   of 2006 (over 100% of GDP). The U.S. net international investment
   position (NIIP)^[24] became a negative $2.5 trillion at the end of
   2006, or about minus 19% of GDP.^[4]^[25]

   This figure rises as long as the US maintains an imbalance in trade,
   when the value of imports substantially outweighs the value of exports.
   This external debt does not result mostly from loans to Americans or
   the American government, nor is it consumer debt owed to non-US
   creditors. It is an accounting entry that largely represents US
   domestic assets purchased with trade dollars and owned overseas,
   largely by US trading partners.^[4]

   For countries like the United States, a large net external debt is
   created when the value of foreign assets (debt and equity) held by
   domestic residents is less than the value of domestic assets held by
   foreigners. In simple terms, as foreigners buy property in the US, this
   adds to the external debt. When this occurs in greater amounts than
   Americans buying property overseas, nations like the United States are
   said to be debtor nations, but this is not conventional debt like a
   loan obtained from a bank.^[4]^[24]

   If the external debt represents foreign ownership of domestic assets,
   the result is that rental income, stock dividends, capital gains and
   other investment income is received by foreign investors, rather than
   by U.S. residents. On the other hand, when American debt is held by
   overseas investors, they receive interest and principal repayments. As
   the trade imbalance puts extra dollars in hands outside of the U.S.,
   these dollars may be used to invest in new assets (foreign direct
   investment, such as new plants) or be used to buy existing American
   assets such as stocks, real estate and bonds. With a mounting trade
   deficit, the income from these assets increasingly transfers
   overseas.^[4]^[24]

   Of major concern is the magnitude of the NIIP (or net external debt),
   which is larger than those of most national economies. Fueled by the
   sizable trade deficit, the external debt is so large that economists
   are concerned over whether the current account deficit is
   unsustainable. A complicating factor is that trading partners such as
   China, depend for much of their economy on exports, especially to
   America. There are many controversies about the current trade and
   external debt situation, and it is arguable whether anyone understands
   how these dynamics will play out in a historically unprecedented
   floating exchange rate system. While various aspects of the U.S.
   economic profile have precedents in the situations of other countries
   (notably government debt as a percentage of GDP), the sheer size of the
   U.S., and the integral role of the US economy in the overall global
   economic environment, create considerable uncertainty about the
   future.^[4]^[24]

   According to economists such as Larry Summers and Paul Krugman, the
   enormous inflow of capital from China is one of the causes of the
   global financial crisis of 2008–2009. China had been buying huge
   quantities of dollar assets to keep its currency value low and its
   export economy humming, which caused American interest rates and saving
   rates to remain artificially low. These low interest rates, in turn,
   contributed to the United States housing bubble because when mortgages
   are cheap, house prices are inflated as people can afford to borrow
   more.^[26]^[27]

Trade agreements[edit]

     Current Bilateral/Multilateral FTA's
     Proposed Bilateral/Multilateral FTA's

   The United States is a partner to many trade agreements, shown in the
   chart below and the map to the right.

   The United States has also negotiated many Trade and Investment
   Framework Agreements, which are often precursors to free trade
   agreements. It has also negotiated many bilateral investment treaties,
   which concern the movement of capital rather than goods.

   The U.S. is a member of several international trade organizations. The
   purpose of joining these organizations is to come to agreement with
   other nations on trade issues, although there is domestic political
   controversy to whether or not the U.S. government should be making
   these trade agreements in the first place. These organizations include:
     * World Trade Organization
     * Organization of American States
     * Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America
