   The White House, the president's official residence and center of the
   administration

   Under the United States Constitution, the President of the United
   States is the head of state and head of government of the United
   States. As chief of the executive branch and head of the federal
   government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office
   in the United States by influence and recognition. The president is
   also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The
   president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral
   College (or by the House of Representatives should the Electoral
   College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person).
   Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United
   States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected President more
   than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to
   which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.^[1] Upon
   the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent
   President, the Vice President assumes the office. The President must be
   at least 35 years of age, has to have lived in the United States for 14
   years, and has to be a "natural born" citizen of the United States.

   This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as
   president following the ratification of the United States Constitution,
   which took effect on March 4, 1789. For American leaders before this
   ratification, see President of the Continental Congress.^[2] The list
   does not include any Acting Presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment
   to the United States Constitution.

   There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as
   Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted
   chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president. Of the individuals
   elected as president, four died in office of natural causes (William
   Henry Harrison,^[3] Zachary Taylor,^[4] Warren G. Harding,^[5] and
   Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,^[6]
   James A. Garfield,^[6]^[7] William McKinley,^[8] and John F. Kennedy)
   and one resigned (Richard Nixon).^[9]

   George Washington, the first president, was inaugurated in 1789 after a
   unanimous vote of the Electoral College. William Henry Harrison spent
   the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt
   spent the longest with over twelve years, but died shortly into his
   fourth term in 1945; he is the only president to have served more than
   two terms. A constitutional amendment, affecting presidents after Harry
   Truman, was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be
   elected president. Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, was the first
   to be elected by white men of all classes in 1828 after most laws
   barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed. Warren Harding was
   the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920. Four
   presidents – John Q. Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison and
   George W. Bush – lost the popular vote but assumed office. John F.
   Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith, and the
   current president, Barack Obama, is the first president of African
   descent.^[10]

Notes

    1. ^ For the purposes of numbering, a presidency is defined as an
       uninterrupted period of time in office served by one person. For
       example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is
       counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the
       resignation of 37th president Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the
       38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of
       Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his
       own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the
       24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A period
       during which a vice-president temporarily becomes Acting President
       under the Twenty-fifth Amendment is not a presidency, because the
       president remains in office during such a period.
    2. ^ Instead of being inaugurated on March 4, 1789, George
       Washington's first-term inaugural was postponed 57 days (1 month
       and 27 days) to April 30, 1789, because the U.S. Congress had not
       yet achieved a quorum.
    3. ^ ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h Unseated (lost re-election).
    4. ^ ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j ^k Died in office of natural
       causes.
    5. ^ ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j ^k ^l ^m ^n ^o ^p ^q ^r Prior to
       ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States
       Constitution in 1967, there was no mechanism by which a vacancy in
       the Vice Presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon was the first
       president to fill such a vacancy under the provisions of the
       Twenty-fifth Amendment when he appointed Gerald Ford. Ford later
       became the second president to fill a vice presidential vacancy
       when he appointed Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him.
    6. ^ ^a ^b ^c Resigned.
    7. ^ Being the first vice president to assume the presidency, Tyler
       set a precedent that a vice president who assumes the office of
       president becomes a fully functioning president who has his own
       presidency, as opposed to just a caretaker president. His political
       opponents attempted to refer to him as "Acting President", but he
       refused to allow that. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United
       States Constitution put Tyler's precedent into the Constitution.
    8. ^ Former Democrat who ran for Vice President on Whig ticket.
       Clashed with Whig congressional leaders and was expelled from the
       Whig party in 1841.
    9. ^ ^a ^b Later sought re-election to a non-consecutive term.
   10. ^ ^a ^b ^c ^d Assassinated.
   11. ^ ^a ^b Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson were, respectively, a
       Republican and a Democrat who ran on the National Union ticket in
       1864.
   12. ^ Andrew Johnson did not identify with the two main parties while
       president and tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under
       the National Union label. His failure to build a true National
       Union Party left Johnson without a party.
   13. ^ The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution went
       into effect in 1933, moving the 1937 inauguration day from March 4
       to January 20, and shortening this term by 43 days.
   14. ^ Dwight Eisenhower is the first president to have been legally
       prohibited by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States
       Constitution from seeking a third term.
   15. ^ Sought an election for a full term, but was unsuccessful
