   Time-driven programming is a computer programming paradigm, where the
   control flow of the computer program is driven by a clock and is often
   used in Real-time computing. A program is divided into a set of tasks
   (i.e., processes or threads), each of which has a periodic activation
   pattern. The activation patterns are stored in a dispatch table ordered
   by time. The Least-Common-Multiple (LCM) of all period-times determines
   the length of the dispatch table. The scheduler of the program
   dispatches tasks by consulting the next entry in the dispatch table.
   After processing all entries, it continues by looping back to the
   beginning of the table.

   The programming paradigm is mostly used for safety critical programs,
   since the behaviour of the program is highly deterministic. No external
   events are allowed to affect the control-flow of the program, the same
   pattern (i.e., described by the dispatch table) will be repeated time
   after time. However, idle time of the processor is also highly
   deterministic, allowing for the scheduling of other non-critical tasks
   through slack stealing techniques during these idle periods.

   The drawback with the method is that the program becomes static (in the
   sense that small changes may recompile into large effects on execution
   structure), and unsuitable for applications requiring a large amount of
   flexibility. For example, the execution time of a task may change if
   its program code is altered. As a consequence, a new dispatch table
   must be regenerated for the entire task set. Such a change may require
   expensive retesting as is often required in safety critical systems.
