   The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution
   provides the procedure for electing the President and Vice President.
   It replaced Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, which provided the
   original procedure by which the Electoral College functioned. Problems
   with the original procedure arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800.
   The Twelfth Amendment refined the process whereby a President and a
   Vice President are elected by the electors of the Electoral College.
   The amendment was proposed by the Congress on December 9, 1803, and was
   ratified by the requisite three–fourths of state legislatures on June
   15, 1804.

Text[edit]

     The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by
     ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least,
     shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they
     shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and
     in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they
     shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and
     all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes
     for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit
     sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed
     to the President of the Senate.

     The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and
     House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes
     shall then be counted.

     The person having the greatest Number of votes for President, shall
     be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number
     of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then
     from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on
     the list of those voted for as President, the House of
     Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President.
     But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states,
     the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for
     this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of
     the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a
     choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a
     President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them,
     before the fourth day of March next following, then the
     Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death
     or other constitutional disability of the President.^[1]

     The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President,
     shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the
     whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a
     majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate
     shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall
     consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a
     majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no
     person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall
     be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.^[2]

Background[edit]

   Under the original procedure for the Electoral College, as provided in
   Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, each elector could vote for two
   persons. The two people chosen by the elector could not both inhabit
   the same state as that elector. This prohibition was designed to keep
   electors from voting for two "favorite sons" of their respective
   states.^[3] The person receiving the greatest number of votes, provided
   that number equaled a majority of the electors, was elected President.

   If there was more than one individual who received the same number of
   votes, and such number equaled a majority of the electors, the House of
   Representatives would choose one of them to be President. If no
   individual had a majority, then the House of Representatives would
   choose from the five individuals with the greatest number of electoral
   votes. In either case, a majority of state delegations in the House was
   necessary for a candidate to be chosen to be President.

   Selecting the Vice President was a simpler process. Whichever candidate
   received the greatest number of votes, except for the one elected
   President, became Vice President. The Vice President, unlike the
   President, did not require the votes of a majority of electors. In the
   event of a tie for second place among multiple candidates, the Senate
   would choose one of them to be Vice President, with each Senator
   casting one vote. It was not specified in the Constitution whether the
   sitting Vice President could cast a tie-breaking vote for Vice
   President under the original formula.

   Problems developed almost immediately. In the 1796 election, John
   Adams, the Federalist Party presidential candidate, received a majority
   of the electoral votes. However, the Federalist electors scattered
   their second votes, resulting in the Democratic-Republican Party
   presidential candidate, Thomas Jefferson, receiving the second highest
   number of electoral votes and thus being elected Vice President.

   The 1800 election exposed a defect in the original formula in that if
   each member of the Electoral College followed party tickets, there
   would be a tie between the two candidates from the most popular ticket.
   The emergence of partisan political activity caused the failure of the
   original constitutional plan.

   Additionally, it was becoming increasingly apparent that a situation in
   which the Vice President had been a defeated electoral opponent of the
   President would impede the ability of the two to effectively work
   together. By having the Presidential and Vice Presidential elected on a
   party ticket, this possibility would be eliminated, or at least
   minimized.

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   Twelfth Amendment in the National Archives

   The Twelfth Amendment was proposed by the 8th Congress on December 9,
   1803, when it was approved by the House of Representatives by vote of
   83–42,^[4] having been previously passed by the Senate, 22–10, on
   December 2.^[5] The amendment was officially submitted to the states on
   December 12, 1803, and was ratified by the legislatures of the
   following states:^[6]
    1. North Carolina — December 21, 1803
    2. Maryland — December 24, 1803
    3. Kentucky — December 27, 1803
    4. Ohio — December 30, 1803
    5. Pennsylvania — January 5, 1804
    6. Vermont — January 30, 1804
    7. Virginia — February 3, 1804
    8. New York — February 10, 1804
    9. New Jersey — February 22, 1804
   10. Rhode Island — March 12, 1804
   11. South Carolina — May 15, 1804
   12. Georgia — May 19, 1804
   13. New Hampshire — June 15, 1804^[7]
       Having been ratified by the requisite three–fourths of the several
       states, there being 17 states in the Union at the time, the
       ratification of the Twelfth Amendment was completed. It was
       subsequently ratified by:
   14. Tennessee — July 27, 1804
   15. Massachusetts — 1961 (After rejection — February 3, 1804)

   The amendment was rejected by:
    1. Delaware — January 18, 1804
    2. Connecticut — May 10, 1804.

   On September 25, 1804, in a circular letter to the governors of the
   states, Secretary of State Madison declared the amendment ratified by
   three-fourths of the states.

Electoral College under the Twelfth Amendment[edit]

   While the Twelfth Amendment did not change the composition of the
   Electoral College or the duties of the electors, it did change the
   process whereby a President and a Vice President are elected. The new
   electoral process was first used for the 1804 election. Each
   presidential election since has been conducted under the terms of the
   Twelfth Amendment.

   The Twelfth Amendment, stipulates that each elector must cast distinct
   votes for President and Vice President, instead of two votes for
   President. Additionally, electors may not vote for presidential and
   vice-presidential candidates who both reside in the elector's state—at
   least one of them must be an inhabitant of another state.

   The Twelfth Amendment explicitly states that the vice president must
   meet the same constitutional requirements as provided for the
   president.^[8] A majority of electoral votes is still required for a
   person to be elected President or Vice President. If no candidate for
   President has a majority of the total votes, the House of
   Representatives, voting by states and with the same quorum requirements
   as under the original procedure, chooses the President. The Twelfth
   Amendment requires the House to choose from the three highest receivers
   of electoral votes, compared to five under the original procedure. If
   no candidate for Vice President has a majority of the total votes, the
   Senate, with each Senator having one vote, chooses the Vice President.
   The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose between the
   candidates with the "two highest numbers" of electoral votes. If
   multiple individuals are tied for second place, the Senate may consider
   all of them, in addition to the individual with the greatest number of
   votes. The Twelfth Amendment introduced a quorum requirement of
   two-thirds of the whole number of Senators for the conduct of
   balloting. Furthermore, the Twelfth Amendment provides that the votes
   of "a majority of the whole number" of Senators are required to arrive
   at a choice.

   In order to prevent deadlocks from keeping the nation leaderless, the
   Twelfth Amendment provided that if the House could not choose a
   President before March 4 (then the first day of a Presidential term),
   the individual elected Vice President would act as President, "as in
   the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the
   President." The Twelfth Amendment did not state for how long the Vice
   President would act as President or if the House could still choose a
   President after March 4. Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment modified
   that provision of the Twelfth Amendment. This amendment, ratified in
   1933, changed the date upon which a new presidential term commences to
   January 20, clarifies that the Vice President-elect would only act as
   President if the House has not chosen a President by January 20, and
   permits the Congress to direct, through legislation, "who shall then
   act as President" if there is no President-elect or Vice
   President-elect by January 20. It also clarifies that if there is no
   President-elect on January 20, whoever acts as President does so until
   a person "qualified" to occupy the Presidency is elected to be
   President.

   There is a point of contention regarding the interpretation of the
   Twelfth Amendment as it relates to the Twenty-second Amendment,
   ratified in 1951, which provides that "No person shall be elected to
   the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held
   the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years
   of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be
   elected to the office of the President more than once.

   While it is clear that under the Twelfth Amendment the original
   constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply
   to both the President and Vice President, it is unclear whether a
   two-term president could later serve as Vice President. Some argue that
   the Twenty-second Amendment and Twelfth Amendment both bar any two-term
   president from later serving as Vice President as well as from
   succeeding to the presidency from any point in the United States
   presidential line of succession.^[9] Others contend that the Twelfth
   Amendment concerns qualification for service, while the Twenty-second
   Amendment concerns qualifications for election, and thus a former
   two-term president is still eligible to serve as vice president.^[10]
   The practical applicability of this distinction has not been tested, as
   no former president has ever sought the vice presidency, and thus the
   courts have never been required to make a judgment regarding the
   matter.

Elections since 1804[edit]

   Starting with the election of 1804, each Presidential election has been
   conducted under the Twelfth Amendment.

   A. Wheeler for the State of Louisiana

   Only once since then has the House of Representatives chosen the
   President: In 1824, Andrew Jackson received 99 electoral votes, John
   Quincy Adams (son of John Adams) 84, William H. Crawford 41 and Henry
   Clay 37. All of the candidates were members of the
   Democratic-Republican Party (though there were significant political
   differences among them), and each had fallen short of the 131 votes
   necessary to win. Because the House could only consider the top three
   candidates, Clay could not become President. Crawford's poor health
   following a stroke made his election by the House unlikely. Andrew
   Jackson expected the House to vote for him, as he had won a plurality
   of the popular and electoral votes.^[11] Instead, the House elected
   Adams on the first ballot with thirteen states, followed by Jackson
   with seven and Crawford with four.^[12] Clay had endorsed Adams for the
   Presidency; the endorsement carried additional weight because Clay was
   the Speaker of the House. When Adams later appointed Clay his Secretary
   of State, many—particularly Jackson and his supporters—accused the pair
   of making a "Corrupt Bargain".^[13] In the less contested election for
   vice president, John C. Calhoun received 182 votes and was elected
   outright.

   In 1836, the Whig Party nominated different candidates in different
   regions in the hopes of splintering the electoral vote and denying
   Martin Van Buren, the Democratic candidate, a majority in the Electoral
   College, thereby throwing the election into the Whig-controlled House.
   However, this strategy failed with Van Buren winning majorities of both
   the popular and electoral vote. In that same election no candidate for
   Vice President secured a majority in the electoral college as
   Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Richard Mentor Johnson did not
   receive the electoral votes of Democratic electors from Virginia,
   because of his relationship with a former slave. As a result Johnson
   received 147 electoral votes, one vote short of a majority; to be
   followed by Francis Granger with 77, John Tyler with 47 and William
   Smith with 23. This caused the Senate to choose whether Johnson or
   Granger would be the new Vice President. Johnson won with 33 votes,
   with Granger receiving 16.^[14]

   Since 1836, no major U.S. party has nominated multiple regional
   presidential or vice presidential candidates in an election. However,
   since the Civil War there have been two serious attempts by
   Southern-based parties to run regional candidates in hopes of denying
   either of the two major candidates an electoral college majority. Both
   attempts (in 1948 and 1968) failed, but not by much—in both cases a
   shift in the result of two close states would have forced the
   respective elections into the House.^[citation needed]

   In modern elections, a running mate is often selected in order to
   appeal to a different set of voters. A Habitation Clause issue arose
   during the 2000 presidential election contested by George W. Bush
   (running-mate Dick Cheney) and Al Gore (running-mate Joe Lieberman),
   because it was alleged that Bush and Cheney were both inhabitants of
   Texas and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth
   Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Bush's residency was
   unquestioned, as he was Governor of Texas at the time. Cheney and his
   wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of
   chief executive at Halliburton. Cheney grew up in Wyoming and had
   represented it in Congress. A few months before the election, he
   switched his voter registration and driver's license to Wyoming and put
   his home in Dallas up for sale. Three Texas voters challenged the
   election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to
   the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where it was
   dismissed.^[15]

       New Hampshire legislature approved the amendment. However, the
       state's governor, John Taylor Gilman, vetoed the resolution of
       ratification on June 20, and the act failed to pass again by the
       two-thirds vote then required by the state constitution. As Article
       V of the Constitution specifies that amendments shall become
       effective "when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of
       the several States or by conventions in three-fourths thereof," it
       has been generally believed that an approval or veto by a governor
       is without significance. Nonetheless, if the ratification by New
       Hampshire be deemed ineffective, then the amendment became
       operative by Tennessee's ratification on July 27, 1804.
