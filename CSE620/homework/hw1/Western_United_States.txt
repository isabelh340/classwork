   Regional definitions vary from source to source. This map reflects the
   Western United States as defined by the Census Bureau, which includes
   13 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho,
   Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. In
   turn, this region is sub-divided into Mountain and Pacific areas.^[1]

   The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West or
   simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the
   westernmost states of the United States. Because the U.S. expanded
   westward after its founding, the meaning of the West has evolved over
   time. Prior to about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was
   seen as the western frontier. Since then, the frontier moved further
   west and the Mississippi River was referenced as the easternmost
   possible boundary of the West.

   The West mostly comprises arid to semi-arid plateaus and plains and
   forested mountains.

   In the 21st century, the states which include the Rocky Mountains and
   the Great Basin to the West Coast are generally considered to comprise
   the American West.

   The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, also known as the "Gateway to the West",
   commemorates the westward expansion of the United States.

   Besides being a purely geographical designation, "The West" also has
   anthropological connotations. While this region has its own internal
   diversity, there is arguably an overall shared history, culture (music,
   cuisine), mind set or world view, and closely interrelated dialects of
   English. As with any region of such geographically large extent and
   varied cultural histories, many subregions of The American West possess
   distinguishing and idiosyncratic qualities.

   The "West" had played an important part in American history; the Old
   West is embedded in America's folklore.

   In its most extensive definition, the western U.S. is the largest
   region, covering more than half the land area of the United States. It
   is also the most geographically diverse, incorporating geographic
   regions such as the Pacific Coast, the temperate rainforests of the
   Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, most of the
   tall-grass prairie eastward to Western Wisconsin, Illinois, the western
   Ozark Plateau, the western portions of the southern forests, the Gulf
   Coast, and all of the desert areas located in the United States (the
   Mojave, Sonoran, Great Basin, and Chihuahua deserts).

   The states from the Rockies westward have something of a dual nature of
   semiarid steppes and arid deserts in the lowlands and plateaus, and
   mountains and coniferous forests in the highlands and coastal regions.

   The region encompasses some of the Louisiana Purchase, most of the land
   ceded by Britain in 1818, some of the land acquired when the Republic
   of Texas joined the U.S., all of the land ceded by Britain in 1846, all
   of the land ceded by Mexico in 1848, and all of the Gadsden Purchase.

   Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah are typically
   considered to be part of the Southwest, and Texas and Oklahoma are
   frequently considered part of the Southwest as well. Idaho, Montana,
   Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming can be considered part of the
   Northwest, and the addition of the Canadian province of British
   Columbia comprise the Pacific Northwest. There is also another region
   of both southwest and northwest states called the Mountain West, which
   is Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, and
   Wyoming.

   The West can be divided into the Pacific States; Alaska, California,
   Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington, with the term West Coast usually
   restricted to just California, Oregon, and Washington, and the Mountain
   States, always Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
   Utah, and Wyoming. Alaska and Hawaii, being detached from the other
   western states, have few similarities with them, but are usually also
   classified as part of the West. Western Texas in the Chihuahuan Desert
   is also traditionally considered part of the Western U.S, though from a
   climatological perspective the West might be said to begin just west of
   Austin where annual rainfall drops off significantly from what is
   typically experienced in the East, with a concurrent change in plant
   and animal species.

   Some western states are grouped into regions with eastern states.
   Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North
   Dakota are often included in the Midwest, which also includes states
   like Illinois and Wisconsin. Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas
   are also considered part of the South.

   It is rare for any state east of the Mississippi River to be considered
   part of the modern west. Historically, however, the Northwest Territory
   was an important early territory of the U.S., comprising the modern
   states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as
   the northeastern part of Minnesota. Also, American sports leagues with
   a "Western" conference or division often have members east of the
   Mississippi for various reasons such as not enough true Western teams,
   not strictly adhering to geographic regions, etc. For example, the NBA
   and NHL each have a Western Conference with a member in Tennessee.

   Cultural heritage institutions dedicated to the study of the American
   West include the Autry National Center, Briscoe Western Art Museum, and
   Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art.

Demographics[edit]

     * 52.8% Non-Hispanic Whites

     * 28.6% were Hispanic or Latino (of any race)^[2]

     * 9.3% Asian

     * 4.8% of Some other race

     * 4.6% Black or African American

   As defined by the United States Census Bureau,^[3] the Western region
   of the United States includes 13 states (with a total 2010 estimated
   population of 71,945,553^[4]) and is split into two smaller units, or
   divisions:

   Mountain States
          Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, Arizona,
          and Nevada

   Pacific States
          Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii

   However, the United States Census Bureau uses only one definition of
   the West in its reporting system, which may not coincide with what may
   be historically or culturally considered the West. For example, in the
   2000 Census, the Census Bureau included the state with the second
   largest Hispanic population, Texas, in the South, included the state
   with the second largest American Indian population, Oklahoma, also in
   the South, and included the Dakotas, with their large populations of
   Plains Indians, in with the Midwest. However, it should be noted that
   the western half of Oklahoma and Far West Texas, are usually neither
   culturally, geographically, or socioeconomically identified with the
   South.

   Statistics from the 2000 United States Census, adjusted to include the
   second tier of States west of the Mississippi, show that, under that
   definition, the West would have a population of 91,457,662, including
   1,611,447 Indians, or 1.8% of the total, and 22,377,288 Hispanics (the
   majority Mexican), or 24.5% of the total. Indians comprise 0.9% of all
   Americans, and Hispanics, 12.5%. Asians, important from the very
   beginning in the history of the West, totaled 5,161,446, or 5.6%, with
   most living in the Far West. African-Americans, totaled 5,929,968, or
   6.5%—lower than the national proportion (12.8%). The highest
   concentrations (12%) of black residents in the West are found in
   Texas—which is also considered a Southern state—and in California.

   The West is still one of the most sparsely settled areas in the United
   States with 49.5 inhabitants per square mile (19/km²). Only Texas with
   78.0 inhabitants/sq mi. (30/km²), Washington with 86.0 inhabitants/sq
   mi. (33/km²), and California with 213.4 inhabitants/sq mi. (82/km²)
   exceed the national average of 77.98 inhabitants/sq mi. (30/km²).
   These maps from the 2000 US Census highlight differences from state to
   state of three minority groups. Note that most of the American Indian,
   Hispanic, and Asian population is in the West.

   The entire Western region has also been strongly influenced by Hispanic
   or Latino, Asian, American Indians, and Pacific Islander; it contains
   the largest number of minorities in the U.S. While most of the studies
   of racial dynamics in America such as riots in Los Angeles have been
   written about European and African Americans, in many cities in the
   West and California, whites and blacks together are less than half the
   population because of the preference for the region by Hispanics and
   Asians. African and European Americans, however, continue to wield a
   stronger political influence because of the lower rates of citizenship
   and voting among Asians and Hispanics.

   The Western United States has a higher sex ratio (more males than
   females) than any other region in the United States.^[5]

   Because the tide of development had not yet reached most of the West
   when conservation became a national issue, agencies of the federal
   government own and manage vast areas of land. (The most important among
   these are the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management
   within the Interior Department, and the U.S. Forest Service within the
   Agriculture Department.) National parks are reserved for recreational
   activities such as fishing, camping, hiking, and boating, but other
   government lands also allow commercial activities like ranching,
   logging, and mining. In recent years, some local residents who earn
   their livelihoods on federal land have come into conflict with the
   land's managers, who are required to keep land use within
   environmentally acceptable limits.

   The largest city in the region is Los Angeles, located on the West
   Coast. Other West Coast cities include San Diego, San Bernardino, San
   Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, Bakersfield, Sacramento, Seattle, Tacoma,
   and Portland. Prominent cities in the Mountain States include Denver,
   Colorado Springs, Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Salt Lake
   City, Boise, El Paso, and Cheyenne.

Natural geography[edit]

   The geography of the Western United States is split into three major
   physiographic divisions: the Rocky Mountain System (areas 16-19 on
   map), the Intermontane Plateaus (20-22), and the Pacific Mountain
   System (23-25).
   Zion National Park in southern Utah is one of five national parks in
   the state.
   Big Sur, California
   The High Desert region of Oregon.
   The quartzite of the Prospect Mountain Formation on top of Wheeler
   Peak, the highest peak in Nevada

   Grand Canyon, Arizona

   Along the Pacific Ocean coast lie the Coast Ranges, which, while not
   approaching the scale of the Rocky Mountains, are formidable
   nevertheless. They collect a large part of the airborne moisture moving
   in from the ocean. East of the Coast Ranges lie several cultivated
   fertile valleys, notably the San Joaquin Valley of California and the
   Willamette Valley of Oregon.

   Beyond the valleys lie the Sierra Nevada in the south and the Cascade
   Range in the north. Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421 m) the tallest
   peak in the contiguous 48 states, is in the Sierra Nevada. The Cascades
   are also volcanic. Mount Rainier, a volcano in Washington, is also over
   14,000 feet (4,300 m). Mount St. Helens, a volcano in the Cascades
   erupted explosively in 1980. A major volcanic eruption at Mount Mazama
   around 4860 BC formed Crater Lake. These mountain ranges see heavy
   precipitation, capturing most of the moisture that remains after the
   Coast Ranges, and creating a rain shadow to the east forming vast
   stretches of arid land. These dry areas encompass much of Nevada, Utah,
   and Arizona. The Mojave Desert and Sonoran Desert along with other
   deserts are found here.

   Beyond the deserts lie the Rocky Mountains. In the north, they run
   almost immediately east of the Cascade Range, so that the desert region
   is only a few miles wide by the time one reaches the Canadian border.
   The Rockies are hundreds of miles (kilometers) wide, and run
   uninterrupted from New Mexico to Alaska. The Rocky Mountain Region is
   the highest overall area of the United States, with an average
   elevation of above 4,000 feet (1,200 m). The tallest peaks of the
   Rockies, 54 of which are over 14,000 feet (4,300 m), are found in
   central and western Colorado.

   The West has several long rivers that empty into the Pacific Ocean,
   while the eastern rivers run into the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi
   River forms the easternmost possible boundary for the West today. The
   Missouri River, a tributary of the Mississippi, flows from its
   headwaters in the Rocky Mountains eastward across the Great Plains, a
   vast grassy plateau, before sloping gradually down to the forests and
   hence to the Mississippi. The Colorado River snakes through the
   Mountain states, at one point forming the Grand Canyon.

   The Colorado is a major source of water in the Southwest and many dams,
   such as the Hoover Dam, form reservoirs along it. So much water is
   drawn for drinking water throughout the West and irrigation in
   California that in most years, water from the Colorado no longer
   reaches the Gulf of California. The Columbia River, the largest river
   in volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from North America, and its
   tributary, the Snake River, water the Pacific Northwest. The Platte
   runs through Nebraska and was known for being a mile (2 km) wide but
   only a half-inch (1 cm) deep. The Rio Grande forms the border between
   Texas and Mexico before turning due north and splitting New Mexico in
   half.

   According to the United States Coast Guard, "The Western Rivers System
   consists of the Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
   Cumberland, Arkansas, and White Rivers and their tributaries, and
   certain other rivers that flow towards the Gulf of Mexico."^[6]

Climate and agriculture[edit]

   Most of the public land held by the U.S. National Forest Service and
   Bureau of Land Management is in the Western states. Public lands
   account for 25 to 75 percent of the total land area in these
   states.^[7]

   As a generalization, the climate of the West can be described as
   overall semiarid; however, parts of the West get extremely high amounts
   of rain and/or snow, and still other parts are true desert and get less
   than 5 inches (130 mm) of rain per year. Also, the climate of the West
   is quite unstable, and areas that are normally wet can be very dry for
   years and vice versa.

   The seasonal temperatures vary greatly throughout the West. Low
   elevations on the West Coast have warm to very hot summers and get
   little to no snow. The Desert Southwest has very hot summers and mild
   winters. While the mountains in the southwest receive generally large
   amounts of snow. The Inland Northwest has a continental climate of warm
   to hot summers and cold to bitter cold winters.

   Annual rainfall is greater in the eastern portions, gradually tapering
   off until reaching the Pacific Coast where it again increases. In fact,
   the greatest annual rainfall in the United States falls in the coastal
   regions of the Pacific Northwest. Drought is much more common in the
   West than the rest of the United States. The driest place recorded in
   the U.S. is Death Valley, California.^[8]

   Violent thunderstorms occur east of the Rockies. Tornadoes occur every
   spring on the southern plains, with the most common and most
   destructive centered on Tornado Alley, which covers eastern portions of
   the West, (Texas to North Dakota), and all states in between and to the
   east.

   Agriculture varies depending on rainfall, irrigation, soil, elevation,
   and temperature extremes. The arid regions generally support only
   livestock grazing, chiefly beef cattle. The wheat belt extends from
   Texas through the Dakotas, producing most of the wheat and soybeans in
   the U.S. and exporting more to the rest of the world. Irrigation in the
   Southwest allows the growing of great quantities of fruits, nuts, and
   vegetables as well as grain, hay, and flowers. Texas is a major cattle
   and sheep raising area, as well as the nation's largest producer of
   cotton. Washington is famous for its apples, and Idaho for its
   potatoes. California and Arizona are major producers of citrus crops,
   although growing metropolitan sprawl is absorbing much of this land.

   Local and state government officials started to understand, after
   several surveys made during the latter part of the 19th century, that
   only action by the federal government could provide water resources
   needed to support the development of the West^[citation needed].
   Starting in 1902, Congress passed a series of acts authorizing the
   establishment of the United States Bureau of Reclamation to oversee
   water development projects in seventeen western states.

   During the first half of the 20th century, dams and irrigation projects
   provided water for rapid agricultural growth throughout the West and
   brought prosperity for several states, where agriculture had previously
   only been subsistence level. Following World War II, the West's cities
   experienced an economic and population boom. The population growth,
   mostly in the Southwest states of New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Arizona,
   and Nevada, has strained water and power resources, with water diverted
   from agricultural uses to major population centers, such as the Las
   Vegas Valley and Los Angeles.

Geology[edit]

   Plains make up much of the eastern portion of the West, underlain with
   sedimentary rock from the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.
   The Rocky Mountains expose igneous and metamorphic rock both from the
   Precambrian and from the Phanerozoic eon. The Inter-mountain States and
   Pacific Northwest have huge expanses of volcanic rock from the Cenozoic
   era. Salt flats and salt lakes reveal a time when the great inland seas
   covered much of what is now the West.

   The Pacific states are the most geologically active areas in the United
   States. Earthquakes cause damage every few to several years in
   California. While the Pacific states are the most volcanically active
   areas, extinct volcanoes and lava flows are found throughout most of
   the West.

History and culture[edit]

   Facing both the Pacific Ocean and the Mexican border, the West has been
   shaped by a variety of ethnic groups. Hawaii is the only state in the
   union in which Asian Americans outnumber white American residents.
   Asians from many countries have settled in California and other coastal
   states in several waves of immigration since the 19th century,
   contributing to the Gold Rush, the building of the transcontinental
   railroad, agriculture, and more recently, high technology.

   The border states—California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—all have
   large Hispanic populations, and the many Spanish place names attest to
   their history as former Spanish and Mexican territories. Other
   southwestern states such as Colorado, Utah, and Nevada have large
   Hispanic populations as well, with many names places also attest to the
   history of former Mexican territories. Mexican-Americans have also had
   a growing population in Northwestern states of Oregon and Washington,
   as well as the southern state of Oklahoma.

   The West also contains much of the Native American population in the
   U.S., particularly in the large reservations in the mountain and desert
   states.
   Hollywood is a well-known area of Los Angeles and the symbolic center
   of the American film industry.

   The largest concentrations for African Americans in the West can be
   found in Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Phoenix,
   Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver, and Colorado Springs.

   Alaska—the northernmost state in the Union—is a vast land of few
   people, many of them native, and of great stretches of wilderness,
   protected in national parks and wildlife refuges. Hawaii's location
   makes it a major gateway between the U.S. and Asia, as well as a center
   for tourism.

   In the Pacific Coast states, the wide areas filled with small towns,
   farms, and forests are supplemented by a few big port cities which have
   evolved into world centers for the media and technology industries. Now
   the second largest city in the nation, Los Angeles is best known as the
   home of the Hollywood film industry; the area around Los Angeles also
   was a major center for the aerospace industry by World War II, though
   Boeing, located in Washington State would lead the aerospace industry.
   Fueled by the growth of Los Angeles, as well as the San Francisco Bay
   area, including Silicon Valley, the center of America's high tech
   industry, California has become the most populous of all the 50 states.

   Oregon and Washington have also seen rapid growth with the rise of
   Boeing and Microsoft along with agriculture and resource based
   industries. The desert and mountain states have relatively low
   population densities, and developed as ranching and mining areas which
   are only recently becoming urbanized. Most of them have highly
   individualistic cultures, and have worked to balance the interests of
   urban development, recreation, and the environment.
   Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument, Utah contains petroglyphs left
   by the first inhabitants of the American Southwest.

   Culturally distinctive points include the large Mormon population in
   the Mormon Corridor, including southeastern Idaho, Utah, Northern
   Arizona, and Nevada; the extravagant casino resort towns of Las Vegas
   and Reno, Nevada; and the numerous American Indian tribal reservations.

Western frontier[edit]

   Main article: American frontier

   Major settlement of the western territories developed rapidly in the
   1840s, largely through the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush of
   1849. California experienced such a rapid growth in a few short months
   that it was admitted to statehood in 1850 without the normal transitory
   phase of becoming an official territory.^[9]

   One of the largest migrations in American history occurred in the 1840s
   as the Latter Day Saints left the Midwest to build a theocracy in Utah.

   Both Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis, Missouri laid claim to the title,
   "Gateway to the West" during this period. Omaha, home to the Union
   Pacific Railroad and the Mormon Trail, made its fortunes on outfitting
   settlers; St. Louis built itself upon the vast fur trade in the West
   before its settlement.

   The 1850s were marked by political battles over the expansion of
   slavery into the western territories, issues leading to the Civil
   War.^[10]

   The history of the American West in the late 19th and early 20th
   centuries has acquired a cultural mythos in the literature and cinema
   of the United States. The image of the cowboy, the homesteader, and
   westward expansion took real events and transmuted them into a myth of
   the west which has shaped much of American popular culture since the
   late 19th century.^[11]

   Writers as diverse as Bret Harte and Zane Grey celebrated or derided
   cowboy culture, while artists such as Frederic Remington created
   western art as a method of recording the expansion into the west. The
   American cinema, in particular, created the genre of the western movie,
   which, in many cases, use the West as a metaphor for the virtue of
   self-reliance and an American ethos. The contrast between the
   romanticism of culture about the West and the actuality of the history
   of the westward expansion has been a theme of late 20th and early 21st
   century scholarship about the West. Cowboy culture has become embedded
   in the American experience as a common cultural touchstone, and modern
   forms as diverse as country and western music have celebrated the sense
   of isolation and independence of spirit inspired by the frontiersmen on
   virgin land.^[12]

The 20th century[edit]

   The advent of the automobile enabled the average American to tour the
   West. Western businessmen promoted U.S. Route 66 as a means to bring
   tourism and industry to the West. In the 1950s, representatives from
   all the western states built the Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western
   Heritage Center to showcase western culture and greet travelers from
   the East. During the latter half of the 20th century, several
   transcontinental interstate highways crossed the West bringing more
   trade and tourists from the East. Oil boom towns in Texas and Oklahoma
   rivaled the old mining camps for their rawness and wealth. The Dust
   Bowl forcing children of the original homesteaders even further
   west.^[13]

   The movies became America's chief entertainment source featuring
   western fiction, later the community of Hollywood in Los Angeles became
   the headquarters of the mass media such as radio and television
   production.^[14]

   California has emerged as the most populous state and one of the top 10
   economies in the world. Massive late 19th-20th century population and
   settlement booms created two megalopolis areas of the Greater Los
   Angeles/Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area/Northern
   California regions, one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas and
   in the top 25 largest urban areas in the world. Four more metropolitan
   areas of San Bernardino-Riverside, San Diego, Denver, Phoenix, and
   Seattle have over a million residents, while the three fastest growing
   metro areas were the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the Las Vegas
   metropolitan area; and the Portland metropolitan area.^[15]^[16]

   Although there has been segregation, along with accusations of racial
   profiling and police brutality towards minorities due to issues such as
   illegal immigration and a racial shift (i.e. White flight and now black
   flight) in neighborhood demographics, sometimes leading to racially
   based riots (i.e. the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and 1965 Watts Riots), the
   West has a continuing reputation for being open-minded and for being
   one of the most racially progressive areas in the United States.

   Los Angeles is said to have the largest Mexican population outside of
   Mexico, while San Francisco has the largest Chinese community in North
   America and also has a large LGBT community, and Oakland, California
   has a large percentage of residents being African-American, as well
   Long Beach, California has a large Black community. The state of Utah
   has a Mormon majority (estimated at 62.4% in 2004),^[17] while some
   cities like Albuquerque, New Mexico; Spokane, Washington; and Tucson,
   Arizona faces Indian Reservations of American Indian tribes, and there
   are Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians to bring forth a great deal of
   racial diversity.

Politics[edit]

   The region's distance from historical centers of power in the East, and
   the celebrated "frontier spirit" of its settlers offer two clichés for
   explaining the region's independent, heterogeneous politics.
   Historically, the West was the first region to see widespread women's
   suffrage. California birthed both the property rights and conservation
   movements, and spawned such phenomena as the Taxpayer Revolt and the
   Berkeley Free Speech Movement. It has also produced three presidents:
   Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.

   The prevalence of libertarian political attitudes is widespread. For
   example, the majority of Western states have legalized medicinal
   marijuana (all but Utah and Wyoming) and some forms of gambling (except
   Utah), Oregon and Washington have legalized physician-assisted suicide,
   most rural counties in Nevada allow licensed brothels, and voters in
   Washington and Colorado have legalized recreational use of
   marijuana.^[19] There is less resistance to the legal recognition of
   same-sex unions: California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico,
   Oregon, and Washington recognize them.

   The West Coast leans toward the Democratic Party. San Francisco's two
   main political parties are the Green Party and the Democratic Party.
   Seattle has historically been a center of radical left-wing politics.
   Both the Democratic leaders of the Congress are from the region: House
   Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader
   Harry Reid of Nevada.

   Interior areas are more Republican, with Alaska, Arizona, Idaho,
   Montana, Utah, and Wyoming being Republican strongholds, and Colorado,
   Nevada, and New Mexico being swing states. The state of Nevada is
   considered a political bellwether, having correctly voted for every
   president except once (in 1976) since 1912. New Mexico too is
   considered a bellwether, having voted for the popular vote winner in
   every presidential election since statehood, except in 1976. The state
   of Arizona has been won by the Republican presidential candidate in
   every election except one since 1948, while the states of Idaho, Utah,
   and Wyoming have been won by the Republican presidential candidate in
   every election since 1964. In recent years, both Utah and Arizona have
   become widely recognized as the country's most conservative states.

   As the fastest-growing demographic group, after Asians, Latinos are
   hotly contested by both parties. Immigration is an important political
   issue for this group. Backlash against illegal aliens led to the
   passage of California Proposition 187 in 1994, a ballot initiative
   which would have denied many public services to illegal aliens.
   Association of this proposal with California Republicans, especially
   incumbent governor Pete Wilson, drove many Hispanic voters to the
   Democrats.^[20]
