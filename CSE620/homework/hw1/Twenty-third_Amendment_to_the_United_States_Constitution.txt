   The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States
   Constitution extends the right to vote in the presidential election to
   citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District
   electors in the Electoral College, as if it were a state. The amendment
   was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the
   states on March 29, 1961.

   The Electoral College, established in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2
   of the United States Constitution, is the institution that officially
   elects the President and Vice President of the United States every four
   years. The President and Vice President are not elected directly by the
   voters. Instead, they are elected by "electors" who are chosen by
   popular vote on a state-by-state basis. As the District of Columbia is
   not a state, it was not entitled to any electors prior to the adoption
   of the Twenty-third Amendment. Citizens living in the district were
   therefore, shut out from the presidential–vice presidential election
   process. The first presidential election in which the District of
   Columbia participated was the election of 1964.

   According to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as
   many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors
   than the least populous state. The least populous state, Wyoming, has
   three electors; thus, the district cannot have more than three
   electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would
   entitle it to only three electors.^[1] Since the passage of this
   amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the
   Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in
   every election.

Text[edit]

     Section 1. The District constituting the seat of Government of the
     United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may
     direct:

     A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the
     whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which
     the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event
     more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to
     those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the
     purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be
     electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District
     and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of
     amendment.

     Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by
     appropriate legislation.^[2]

Background[edit]

   The United States Constitution's rules for the composition of the House
   of Representatives and the Senate explicitly grant seats to states, and
   no other entities. Similarly, electors to the electoral college are
   apportioned to states, not to territories or the federal district. The
   main reference to the federal district is in Article One, Section Eight
   of the Constitution which gives Congress the power "To exercise
   exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not
   exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States,
   and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of
   the United States."^[3] In the early existence of the District, it was
   too small and rural to merit a hypothetical seat in the House of
   Representatives anyway, with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants.^[4]

   In 1890, a bill was introduced into Congress to grant Washington, D.C.
   voting rights in presidential elections; it did not proceed forward,
   however.^[5] Theodore W. Noyes, a writer of the Washington Evening
   Star, published a number of stories in support of D.C. voting rights.
   Noyes also helped found the Citizens' Joint Committee on National
   Representation for the District of Columbia, a citizen's group which
   lobbied Congress to pass an amendment expanding D.C. voting rights.
   Noyes died in 1946, but the Citizens' Joint Committee continued onward,
   and the issue of District voting rights began to be seen as similar to
   the civil rights movement.^[5] A split developed between advocates for
   greater power for the District after World War II. The Evening Star,
   continuing in the Noyes mold, supported D.C. representation in Congress
   and the electoral college, but opposed "home rule" (locally elected
   mayors & councils with actual power, rather than direct rule by
   Congress). The Washington Post, however, supported "home rule" and
   civil rights, but opposed full-fledged representation for the
   District.^[5] Additionally, while many of the people leading the push
   were liberal Democrats, the District of Columbia in the 1950s was
   fairly balanced in its potential voting impact; Democrats had only a
   slight edge over Republicans, although District Republicans in the
   1950s were liberal by national standards.^[5] Thus, an amendment to
   grant the District increased voting powers was able to gain bipartisan
   support in a way that would have been more difficult later. Only 28% of
   the District was African-American according to the 1940 census, and the
   black population was young compared to other residents, making the
   voting electorate even smaller due to the voting age of 21. This grew
   to 54% in the 1960 census, but according to historian Clement E. Vose,
   "various factors—inexperience in voting, educational handicaps,
   residency requirements, welfare laws, and social ostracism before the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965—minimized black registration and voting."^[6]

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   The Twenty-third Amendment in the National Archives

Adoption by the Congress[edit]

   Senate Joint Resolution–39, which would eventually become the
   Twenty-third Amendment was introduced in 1959 by Tennessee Democratic
   Senator Estes Kefauver. His proposal would provide for the emergency
   functioning of Congress and continuity of the legislative process by
   authorized governors to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives
   “on any date that the total number of vacancies ... exceeds half of the
   authorized membership.” The governor’s appointive authority would have
   been limited to 60 days, and the appointee would have served until a
   successor was elected in a special election. The bill was amended twice
   on the Senate floor. One added provision, proposed by New York
   Republican Kenneth Keating, would grant the District of Columbia
   electoral votes in national elections and non-voting delegate(s) to the
   House. The other, offered by Florida Democrat Spessard Holland, would
   eliminate the poll tax or other property qualification as a
   prerequisite for voting in federal elections. The Senate passed SJR–39
   in this three-amendment form on February 2, 1960, by a vote of 70–18,
   and sent it forward to the House.

   The House Judiciary Committee, after setting aside the anti-poll tax
   and House emergency appointment provisions of SJR–39, sent its own
   proposal, House Joint Resolution–757, devoted solely to presidential
   electors for the District of Columbia, to the House floor for
   consideration. This was adopted in the House without amendment, by
   voice vote, on June 14, 1960. Then, by unanimous consent, the text of
   HJR–757 was inserted into SJR–39, the original language of which was
   removed. The Senate adopted the revised resolution by voice vote on
   June 16, 1960.^[7]^[8]^[9]

Ratification by the states[edit]

     No action taken on amendment

   To become valid as part of the Constitution, the Twenty-third Amendment
   needed to be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the
   states (38, following admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the union in
   1959) within seven years from its submission to the states by Congress
   (June 16, 1967). President Eisenhower, along with both major party
   candidates in the 1960 presidential election, John F. Kennedy and
   Richard Nixon, endorsed the proposal. Amendment supporters ran an
   effective ratification campaign, mobilizing persons in almost every
   state to press for its approval.^[6]

   The following states ratified the amendment:^[10]
    1. Hawaii — June 23, 1960
    2. Massachusetts — August 22, 1960
    3. New Jersey — December 19, 1960
    4. New York — January 17, 1961
    5. California — January 19, 1961
    6. Oregon — January 27, 1961
    7. Maryland — January 30, 1961
    8. Idaho — January 31, 1961
    9. Maine — January 31, 1961

   17. Alaska — February 10, 1961
   18. Wyoming — February 13, 1961
   19. South Dakota — February 14, 1961 (date of filing in Office of
       Secretary of State of South Dakota)
   20. Delaware — February 20, 1961
   21. Utah — February 21, 1961
   22. Wisconsin — February 21, 1961
   23. Pennsylvania — February 28, 1961
   24. Indiana — March 3, 1961
   25. North Dakota — March 3, 1961
   26. Tennessee — March 6, 1961
   27. Michigan — March 8, 1961
   28. Connecticut — March 9, 1961
   29. Arizona — March 10, 1961
   30. Illinois — March 14, 1961
   31. Nebraska — March 15, 1961
   32. Vermont — March 15, 1961
   33. Iowa — March 16, 1961
   34. Missouri — March 20, 1961
   35. Oklahoma — March 21, 1961
   36. Rhode Island — March 22, 1961
   37. Kansas — March 29, 1961
   38. Ohio — March 29, 1961
       Ratification was completed on March 29, 1961, 9 months and 12 days
       after being proposed by Congress.^[11] The amendment was
       subsequently ratified by the following states:
   39. New Hampshire — March 30, 1961 (Date in official notice; preceded
       by ratification on March 29, 1961, as the 37th state to ratify,
       which was annulled and then repeated later that same day.)
   40. Alabama — April 11, 2002

   On April 3, 1961, John L. Moore, Administrator of General Services,
   certiﬁed that the amendment had been adopted by the requisite number of
   States and had become a part of the Constitution.

   The amendment was rejected by Arkansas on January 24, 1961.^[12] Nine
   states took no action on the amendment: Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi,
   Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina, and Virginia

Political impact[edit]

   See also: District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment and District of
   Columbia home rule

   While perceived as politically neutral and only somewhat
   liberal-leaning at the time of passage in 1961, the District swung
   dramatically toward the Democratic Party in the years after passage.
   African-Americans voted in greater numbers than they had in the 1940s
   and 1950s with the clearing away of restrictions on the vote, and their
   share of the District electorate increased - according to the 1970
   census, 71% of the Federal District was black, a dramatic jump.^[6]
   Accordingly, the District has sent its 3 electoral votes to the
   Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964,
   including the 1984 landslide re-election of President Reagan, where
   only the District of Columbia and Minnesota voted for Democratic
   candidate Walter Mondale.

   Unaddressed by the Twenty-third Amendment were the parallel issues of
   congressional representation and "home rule" for the district. On
   December 24, 1973, Congress approved the District of Columbia Home Rule
   Act, which established an elected office of mayor and a 13-member
   elected council for the district.^[13] These officials were empowered
   pass laws and enact administrative policies for the District, though
   Congress retained veto power, if they chose to intervene. On March 23,
   1971, President Nixon signed the District of Columbia Delegate Act
   which authorized voters in the District to elect one non-voting
   delegate to represent them in the House of Representatives.^[14] On
   August 22, 1978, Congress adopted the District of Columbia Voting
   Rights Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification.^[15]^[16]
   This sweeping proposal would have granted the District of Columbia full
   representation in the United States Congress as if it were a state,
   repealed the 23rd Amendment and granted the District full
   representation in the Electoral College plus participation in the
   process by which the Constitution is amended as if it were a
   state.^[17] The amendment failed to become part of the Constitution
   however, as it was not ratified by the required number of states (38)
   prior to its August 22, 1985 ratification deadline.^[18] The campaign
   for the DCRA ran into much fiercer conservative opposition due to the
   open and obvious fact by 1978 that the DCRA would practically guarantee
   2 Democratic Senators for some time; the amendment was criticized on
   various other grounds as well, and did not gain support even from
   several more "liberal" states.^[19]
