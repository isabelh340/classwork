National constitutions[edit]

   The historian William Hardy McNeill argued that the United States saw
   itself as "one of a family of peoples and nations" making a history
   apart from the European civilization of their colonization.^[1]

   The United States Constitution is an expression of Americans diverging
   from colonial rule, according to this viewpoint. Its effect is
   reflected in the ideals of limiting the rulers of a state apart and
   above sitting law-givers in a parliament. The concepts of governance
   influencing others internationally are not only found among
   similarities in phrasing and entire passages from the U.S.
   Constitution. They are in the principles of the rule of law and
   recognition of individual rights. The American experience of
   fundamental law with amendments and judicial review has motivated
   foreign constitutionalists to reconsider possibilities for their own
   future.^[1] This view informed Abraham Lincoln during the American
   Civil War,^[a] his contemporary and ally Benito Juarez of Mexico,^[b]
   and the second generation of 19th constitutional nationalists, José
   Rizal of the Philippines^[c] and Sun Yat-sen of China.^[d]

   Generally the influence of the Constitution is documented in
   trans-national history of ideas, foreign translations, and exchanges
   between Americans and their counterparts from the beginning with
   smuggled translations into Hispanic America until today with
   conferences among national legislators. Innovations include
   constitutional conventions, written constitutions, ratification and
   amendment procedures. There are common provisions for presidential
   executives, federalism and judicial review.^[1]

   George Athan Billias, studying the Constitution and related documents,
   describes six waves of influence:
    1. From 1776-1811, after the American Revolution began, it influenced
       northwestern Europe and its colonial connections.
    2. 1811-1848, after the decline of Napoleon's reputation, it was
       referenced by Latin American, Caribbean, and European nationalists.
    3. 1898-1918, after the Spanish American War, nationalist movements
       borrowed from the U.S. Constitution in Asia and Latin America.
    4. 1918-1945, after World War I, its influence spread with movements
       for decolonization of Africa, Mid-east and Asia.
    5. 1945-1974, after World War II, independence movements consulted it.
    6. 1974-1989, after United Nations expansion, once nondemocratic
       regimes, including European ones, transitioned towards
       constitutional democracies incorporating elements of the U.S.
       Constitution.^[1]

   Over its history, American constitutionalism has waxed and waned in
   influence. Democratizing countries have often chosen the more
   centralized, consolidated British or French models. Countries that were
   once part of the British Empire favored the British Westminster
   parliamentary system.^[7] Internationally it appears that those of
   Confucian and Islamic cultures do not readily adopt some of its
   premises. Nevertheless, "the influence of American constitutionalism
   abroad was profound in the past and remains a remarkable contribution
   to humankind’s search for freedom under a system of laws."^[1]

   According to a 2012 study published in the New York University Law
   Review, however, the influence of the U.S. Constitution may be waning.
   The study examined more than 700 federal constitutions from nearly 200
   countries. "Rather than leading the way for global constitutionalism,
   the U.S. Constitution appears instead to be losing its appeal as a
   model for constitutional drafters elsewhere,” the researchers write.
   “The idea of adopting a constitution may still trace its inspiration to
   the United States, but the manner in which constitutions are written
   increasingly does not."^[8]^[9]

   In particular, the study found that the U.S. Constitution guarantees
   relatively few rights compared to the constitutions of other countries
   and contains less than half (26 of 60) of the provisions listed in the
   average bill of rights. It is also one of the few in the world today
   that still features the right to bear arms; the only others are the
   constitutions of Guatemala and Mexico. Overall, the research suggests
   that the Constitution of Canada, revised in 1982, is now a leading
   international model rather than that of the United States.^[8]^[9]

Translations[edit]

   The Constitution has been translated into many languages.

   The Federal Judicial Center has links to materials about the United
   States government and judicial system. The site has materials in 16
   languages besides English, such as Dari, Indonesian, Malay, Serb, and
   Turkish. ^[10] The Center's statutory mission includes compiling
   histories and research resources and conferences. Its goal is to
   improve administration of justice in the U.S. and foreign countries.
   The Center works with judges and court officials of other nations, and
   other judicial education organizations.^[11]

   The Columbia Law Review sponsors the International Constitutional Law
   Project. The Project has over 100 constitutions and provides English
   translations of and other textual material related to constitutional
   documents. The Project cross-references those documents for quick
   comparison of constitutional provisions internationally and internally
   within each document; the Project includes background information.^[12]
   The Historical Society of Philadelphia lists translations of the United
   States Constitution into various foreign languages. One example is
   Armenian.^[13]

   University of Chicago Library features constitutional resources on the
   influence of the Constitution abroad. The Library holds texts of
   non-U.S. Constitutions, case reports, books, journals, articles and
   current commentary.^[14] At the University of Richmond’s Constitution
   Finder, there are international constitutions, historical constitutions
   and state constitutions. There is the Constitution of 1787 with its
   amendments, five unpassed amendments, the Articles of Confederation,
   the Confederate Constitution and 84 state constitutions past and
   present.^[15]

   Professor James Chen has annotated the Spanish translation prepared by
   the U.S. State Department. His notes focus on the problems and nuances
   of this translation.^[16] Nguyen Canh Binh has translated the
   Constitution into Vietnamese.^[17] The Bill of Rights has been
   translated into Hawaiian.^[18] Elizabeth Claire has rewritten the
   Constitution into simplified English.^[19] Some of the many
   translations of the Constitution are listed below.

Commemorative stamps[edit]

                            *

                                                     150th Anniversary
                                                2nd Spanish Republic, 1937

   In 1937 the U.S. Post Office released a commemorative stamp to
   celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S.
   Constitution. The engraving shown on this issue is after an 1856
   painting by Junius Brutus Stearns of Washington and shows delegates
   signing the Constitution at the 1787 Convention. George Washington is
   on dais with an open document in hand; James Madison sits at the table,
   taking his famous notes on the convention.

   One commemorative of the 19th Amendment (permitting women the right to
   vote) was celebrated in a commemorative in 1950 and again in 1970. The
   woman is voting in a curtained mechanical voting booth. She chooses
   levers to punch or mark her votes on a paper roll. The Model T has a
   man driver with a banner "Votes for women" on the car, women riders and
   marchers as though in a parade.

   The Second Polish Republic issued a commemorative of the U.S. and
   Polish Constitutions in 1938 under the government of Prime Minister,
   Major General Składkowski The stamp features George Washington in
   military regalia, holding a 48-star American flag and a drawn sword.
   Thomas Paine holds a book on a rod, and Kosciuszko poses with a cross
   and saber. The next scene shows a line of infantry flying a Polish
   flag. The right panel shows the Statue of Liberty imposed in front of
   the New York 1930s skyline.

   In 1937 the Second Spanish Republic commemorated the 150th anniversary
   of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, under the government of Prime
   Minister Juan Negrín of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE).
   The Statue of Liberty is the central focus, flanked by flags of Spain
   and the United States. The Spanish Republic Flag of red, yellow and
   purple, as battle flag or civil ensign, lacks the coat of arms.

    1. ^ "Secession was indeed unconstitutional...military resistance to
       secession was not only constitutional but also morally
       justified.^[2] "the primary purpose of the Constitution was ... to
       create ‘a more perfect union’... the Constitution was an exercise
       in nation building.^[3]
    2. ^ Juarez regarded the United States as a model of republican
       democracy and consistently supported Abraham Lincoln.^[4]
    3. ^ The institutions of the two countries which have most influenced
       constitutional development are Spain and the United States." One of
       the reforms, "sine quibus non", to use the words of Rizal and
       Mabini, always insisted upon by the Filipinos, was Philippine
       representation in the Spanish Cortez, the promulgation in the
       Islands of the Spanish Constitution, and the complete assimilation
       equal to that of any in the Spanish provinces on the continent.^[5]
    4. ^ In the modern history of China, there were many revolutionaries
       who tried to seek the truth from the West in order to overthrow the
       feudal system of the Ching Dynasty. Dr. Sun Yat-sen for example was
       much influenced by American democracy, especially the U.S.
       Constitution.^[6]
