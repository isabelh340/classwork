   United States. Light red states are considered "Southeastern" with less
   frequency.

   The Southeastern United States, colloquially referred to as the South,
   is the eastern portion of the Southern United States, and the southern
   portion of the Eastern United States.

Demographics[edit]

   There is no official Census Bureau definition of the southeastern
   United States. However, the Association of American Geographers defines
   the southeastern United States as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
   Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and
   West Virginia.^[1]

Most populous states[edit]

   The most populous state in the region was Florida (19,552,860),^[2]
   followed by Georgia (9,992,167),^[3] and North Carolina
   (9,848,060).^[4]

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the Southern United States

Culture[edit]

   Main article: Culture of the Southern United States

   The predominant culture of the South has its origins with the
   settlement of the region by British colonists and African slaves in the
   17th century, as well as large groups of English, Scots and
   Ulster-Scots, Germans, French, and Acadians in succeeding centuries.

Economy[edit]

   articles for further suggestions. (March 2014)

   The South has changed dramatically in the last two generations. Since
   1980, there has been a boom in its service economy, manufacturing base,
   high technology industries, and the financial sector. Examples of this
   include the surge in tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast;
   numerous new automobile production plants such as Mercedes-Benz in
   Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Hyundai in Montgomery, Alabama; Toyota Motors in
   Blue Springs, Mississippi; Kia in West Point, Georgia; the BMW
   production plant in Greer, South Carolina; Volkswagen in Chattanooga,
   Tennessee; the GM manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; and
   the Nissan North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee; the two
   largest research parks in the country: Research Triangle Park in the
   Triangle area of North Carolina (the world's largest) and the Cummings
   Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama (the world's fourth largest); and
   the corporate headquarters of major banking corporations Bank of
   America in Charlotte; Regions Financial Corporation, AmSouth
   Bancorporation, and BBVA Compass in Birmingham; SunTrust Banks and the
   district headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; and BB&T
   in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As well as Fortune 500 companies,
   there are several large companies including several paper companies,
   such as Georgia Pacific in Atlanta and International Paper and Verso
   Paper in Memphis, as well as FedEx, which is one of the world's largest
   shipping companies. Fortune 500 companies having headquarters in the
   region included 20 in Virginia, 16 in Florida, 15 in North Carolina,
   and 14 in Georgia. This economic expansion has enabled parts of the
   South to have of some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United
   States.^[5] Alabama is also home to a large-scale manufacturing project
   owned by the German steel megacorporation Thyssen-Krupp, which operates
   a massive, state-of-the-art facility in Mobile.

   University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida

   The Southeast is home to a number of prominent universities, with
   several large research universities of longstanding significance which
   exert influence beyond the region.

   Research Triangle Park, in the Raleigh-Durham urban area of North
   Carolina, has emerged as a major hub of technology, governmental, and
   biotechnological research and development, as has the Virginia
   BioTechnology Research Park in Richmond. The Cummings Research Park in
   the Huntsville, Alabama area is the second largest research complex in
   the nation. It is one of the biggest areas of aerospace engineering and
   missile defense technology.^[citation needed] Huntsville is also home
   to Redstone Arsenal, United States Army Missile Command, the U.S. Space
   and Rocket Center, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and many other
   key government, military, and aerospace agencies. The National High
   Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida is the largest
   laboratory in the world devoted to the study of magnetism.^[citation
   needed] The University of South Carolina is currently constructing a
   research campus in downtown Columbia, and the University is the
   nation’s only National Science Foundation-funded Industry/University
   Cooperative Research Center for Fuel Cells.^[6]

Combined Statistical Areas[edit]

   Beyond Megalopolis by Virginia Tech's Metropolitan Institute, an
   attempt to update Jean Gottmann's work with current trends, defines two
   "megapolitan areas" contained within the Southeast, out of a total of
   ten such areas in the United States:
     * "Piedmont" extending from North Carolina to Alabama
     * "Peninsula" covering South Florida and Central Florida

   Two others tie some areas on the margins of the Southeast to urban
   centers in other regions:
     * "Gulf Coast" extending as far east as the western tip of Florida
     * "Northeast" including much of eastern Virginia

   These are the combined statistical areas of the Southeastern region
   which exceed 1 million in population according to the United States
   Census Bureau's 2013 estimates. Note that the metropolitan areas of
   Tampa and Richmond are not included in any CSA's so they are included
