   In the United States, affirmative action refers to equal opportunity
   employment measures that Federal contractors and subcontractors are
   legally required to adopt. These measures are intended to prevent
   discrimination against employees or applicants for employment on the
   basis of "color, religion, sex, or national origin".^[1]^[2] Examples
   of affirmative action offered by the United States Department of Labor
   include outreach campaigns, targeted recruitment, employee and
   management development, and employee support programs.^[2]

   The impetus toward affirmative action is to redress the
   disadvantages^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7] associated with overt historical
   discrimination.^[8] Further impetus is a desire to ensure public
   institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are
   more representative of the populations they serve.^[9] Affirmative
   action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as
   affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for
   collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse
   discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been
   ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger.
   Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the court's decision in
   Grutter v. Bollinger.^[10]

History[edit]

Roosevelt Administration[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Franklin D. Roosevelt.

   The first appearance of the term ‘affirmative action’ was in the
   National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, of
   1935.^[11]^:15 Proposed and championed by U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner
   of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt’s goal
   of providing economic security to workers and other low-income
   groups.^[12] During this time period it was not uncommon for employers
   to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. The Wagner Act
   allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated
   against, and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review
   potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of
   discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status
   in the company through ‘affirmative action’.^[13] While the Wagner Act
   protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who,
   exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred
   from union ranks.^[11]^:11 This original coining of the term therefore
   has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today,
   but helps set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address
   an individual’s unjust treatment.

   FDR’s New Deal programs often contained equal opportunity clauses
   stating “no discrimination shall be made on account of race, color or
   creed”,^[11]^:11 but the true forerunner to affirmative action was the
   Interior Secretary of the time, Harold L. Ickes. Ickes prohibited
   discrimination in hiring for Public Works Administration funded
   projects and oversaw not only the institution of a quota system, where
   contractors were required to employ a fixed percentage of Black
   workers, by Robert C. Weaver and Clark Foreman,^[11]^:12 but also the
   equal pay of women proposed by Harry Hopkins.^[11]^:14FDR’s largest
   contribution to affirmative action, however, lay in his Executive Order
   8802 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry or
   government.^[11]^:22 The executive order promoted the idea that if
   taxpayer funds were accepted through a government contract, then all
   taxpayers should have an equal opportunity to work through the
   contractor.^[11]^:23–4 To enforce this idea, Roosevelt created the Fair
   Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) with the power to investigate
   hiring practices by government contractors.^[11]^:22

Truman Era[edit]

   Following the Sergeant Isaac Woodard incident, President Harry S.
   Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order
   9808 establishing the President's Committee on Civil Rights to examine
   the violence and recommend appropriate federal legislation. Hearing of
   the incident, Truman turned to NAACP leader Walter F. White and
   declared, “My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We’ve got
   to do something.” In 1947 the committee published its findings, To
   Secure These Rights. The book was widely read, influential, and
   considered utopian for the times: “In our land men are equal, but they
   are free to be different. From these very differences among our people
   has come the great human and national strength of America.” The report
   discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms,
   education, public facilities, personal safety, and employment
   opportunities. The committee was disturbed by the state of race
   relations, and included the evacuation of Americans of Japanese descent
   during the war “made without a trial or any sort of hearing…Fundamental
   to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not
   a matter of heredity or association.” The recommendations were radical,
   calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and
   bring about equality: “We can tolerate no restrictions upon the
   individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race, his
   color, his religion, or the social position to which he is born.” To
   Secure These Rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next
   generation that eventually would be signed into law by Lyndon Baines
   Johnson.^[14]

   To Secure These Rights also called for desegregation of the armed
   forces. “Prejudice in any area is an ugly, undemocratic phenomenon, but
   in the armed services, where all men run the risk of death, it is
   especially repugnant.” The rationale was fairness: “When an individual
   enters the service of the country, he necessarily surrenders some of
   the rights and privileges which are inherent in American citizenship.”
   In return, the government “undertakes to protect his integrity as an
   individual.” Yet that was not possible in the segregated Army, since
   “any discrimination which…prevents members of the minority groups from
   rendering full military service in defense of their country is for them
   a humiliating badge of inferiority.” The report called for an end to
   “all discrimination and segregation based on race, color, creed, or
   national origins in…all branches of the Armed Services.”^[15]

   In 1947 Truman and his advisors came up with a plan for a large
   standing military, called Universal Military Training, and presented it
   to Congress. The plan opposed all segregation in the new postwar armed
   forces: “Nothing could be more tragic for the future attitude of our
   people, and for the unity of our nation” than a citizens’ military that
   emphasized “class or racial difference.”^[16]

   On February 2, 1948 President Truman delivered a special message to
   Congress. It consisted of ten objectives that Congress should focus on
   when enacting legislation. Truman concluded by saying, “If we wish to
   inspire the peoples of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy, if we
   wish to restore hope to those who have already lost their civil
   liberties, if we wish to fulfill the promise that is ours, we must
   correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy.”^[17]

   In June, Truman became the first president to address the NAACP. His
   speech was a significant departure from traditional race relations in
   the United States. In front of 10,000 at the Lincoln Memorial, the
   president left no doubt where he stood on civil rights. America had
   “reached a turning point in the long history of our country’s efforts
   to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens…Each man must be
   guaranteed equality of opportunity.” He proposed what black citizens
   had been calling for - an enhanced role of federal authority through
   the states. “We must make the Federal government a friendly, vigilant
   defender of the rights and equalities of all Americans. And again I
   mean all Americans.”^[18]

   On July 26, Truman mandated the end of hiring and employment
   discrimination in the federal government, reaffirming FDR’s order of
   1941.^[18] He issued two executive orders on July 26, 1948: Executive
   Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981. Executive Order 9980, named
   Regulations Governing for Employment Practices within the Federal
   Establishment,^[19] instituted fair employment practices in the
   civilian agencies of the federal government. The order created the
   position of Fair Employment Officer. The order “established in the
   Civil Service Commission a Fair Employment Board of not less than seven
   persons.”^[20] Executive Order 9981, named Establishing the President’s
   Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed
   Services,^[21] called for the integration of the armed forces and the
   creation of the National Military Establishment to carry out the
   executive order.^[22]

   On December 3, 1951 Truman issued Executive Order 10308, named
   Improving the Means for Obtaining Compliance with the Nondiscrimination
   Provisions of Federal Contracts,^[23] which established an
   anti-discrimination committee on government contract compliance
   responsible for ensuring that employers doing business with the federal
   government comply with all laws and regulations enacted by Congress and
   the committee on the grounds of discriminatory practices.^[24]

Eisenhower Administration[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Dwight D. Eisenhower.

   When Eisenhower was elected President in 1952, he believed hiring
   practices and anti discrimination laws should be decided by the states,
   although the administration gradually continued to desegregate the
   armed forces and the federal government.^[11]^:50 The President also
   established the Government Contract Committee in 1953, which “conducted
   surveys of the racial composition of federal employees and
   tax-supported contractors”.^[11]^:50–51 The committee, chaired by Vice
   President Richard Nixon, had minimal outcomes in that they imposed the
   contractors with the primary responsibility of desegregation within
   their own companies and corporations.^[11]^:51

Kennedy Administration[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see John F. Kennedy.

   In the 1960 presidential election, democratic candidate and future
   President John F. Kennedy “criticized President Eisenhower for not
   ending discrimination in federally supported housing” and “advocated a
   permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission”.^[11]^:59 Shortly after
   taking office, Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925 in March 1961,
   requiring government contractors to “consider and recommend additional
   affirmative steps which should be taken by executive departments and
   agencies to realize more fully the national policy of
   nondiscrimination…. The contractor will take affirmative action to
   ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated
   during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or
   national origin”.^[11]^:60 The order also established the President’s
   Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), chaired by Vice
   President Lyndon Johnson. Federal contractors who failed to comply or
   violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and
   the possible debarment from future government contracts. The
   administration was “not demanding any special preference or treatment
   or quotas for minorities” but was rather “advocating racially neutral
   hiring to end job discrimination”.^[11]^:61 Turning to issues of
   women’s rights, Kennedy initiated a Commission on the Status of Women
   in December 1961. The commission was charged with “examining employment
   policies and practices of the government and of contractors” with
   regard to sex.^[11]^:66

   In June 1963, President Kennedy continued his policy of affirmative
   action by issuing another mandate, Executive Order 11114. The order
   supplemented to his previous 1961 executive order declaring it was the
   “policy of the United States to encourage by affirmative action the
   elimination of discrimination in employment”.^[11]^:72 Through this
   order, all federal funds, such as “grants, loans, unions and employers
   who accepted taxpayer funds, and other forms of financial assistance to
   state and local governments,” were forced to comply to the government’s
   policies on affirmative action in employment practices.^[11]^:72

Lyndon B. Johnson[edit]

   Lyndon B. Johnson, the Texan Democrat and Senate Majority Leader from
   1955–1961, began to consider running for high office, and in doing so
   showed how his differing racial views from the traditional South. In
   1957, Johnson brokered a civil rights act through Congress. The bill
   established a Civil Rights Division and Commission in the Justice
   Department. The commission was empowered to investigate allegations of
   minority deprivation of rights.^[25]

   The first time “affirmative action” is used by the federal government
   concerning race is in President John F. Kennedy’s Executive Order
   10925, which was chaired by Vice President Johnson. At Johnson’s
   inaugural ball in Texas, he met with a young black lawyer, Hobart
   Taylor Jr., and gave him the task to co-author the executive order. He
   wanted a phrase that “gave a sense of positivity to performance under
   the order.” He was torn between the words “positive action” and
   “affirmative action,” and selected the later due to its alliterative
   quality. The term “active recruitment” started to be used as well. This
   order, albeit heavily worked up as a significant piece of legislation,
   in reality carried little actual power. The scope was limited to a
   couple hundred defense contractors, leaving nearly $7.5 billion in
   federal grants and loans unsupervised.^[26]

   NAACP had many problem’s with JFK’s “token” proposal. They wanted jobs.
   One day after the order took effect, NAACP labor secretary Herbert Hill
   filed complaints against the hiring and promoting practices of Lockheed
   Aircraft Corporation. Lockheed was doing business with the defense
   department on the first billion-dollar contract. Due to
   taxpayer-funding being 90% of Lockheed’s business, along with
   disproportionate hiring practices, black workers charged Lockheed with
   “overt discrimination.” Lockheed signed an agreement with Vice
   President Johnson that pledged an “aggressive seeking out for more
   qualified minority candidates for technical and skill positions.^[27]
   This agreement was the administration’s model for a “plan of progress.”
   Johnson and his assistants soon pressured other defense contractors,
   including Boeing and General Electric, to sign similar voluntary
   agreements indicating plans for progress. However, these plans were
   just that, voluntary. Many corporations in the South, still afflicted
   with Jim Crow, largely ignored the federal recommendations.^[27]

   This eventually led to LBJ’s Civil Rights Act, which came shortly after
   President Kennedy’s assassination. This document was more holistic than
   any President Kennedy had offered, and therefore more controversial. It
   aimed not only to integrate public facilities, but also private
   businesses that sold to the public, such as motels, restaurants,
   theaters, and gas stations. Public schools, hospitals, libraries,
   parks, among other things, were included in the bill as well. It also
   worked with JFK’s executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination
   in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the
   government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate. Maybe most
   significant of all, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act aimed to end
   discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees. Another
   provision established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as
   the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation’s
   workplace.^[28]

   Title VII was perhaps the most controversial of the entire bill. Many
   conservatives accused it of advocating of a quota system, and claimed
   unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota
   Senator Hubert H. Humphrey corrected this notion: “there is nothing in
   [Title VII] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring,
   firing, and promotion to meet a racial ‘quota.’ [. . .] Title VII is
   designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and
   qualifications, not race or religion.” Title VII prohibits
   discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill’s passing
   through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just
   nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business
   Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (IL) to
   support Title VII.^[29]

   On July 2, 1964, the Act was signed into law by President Johnson. A
   Harris poll that spring showed 70% citizen approval of the Act.^[30]

Richard Nixon Administration[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Richard Nixon.

   The strides that the Johnson presidency made in ensuring equal
   opportunity in the workforce were further picked up by his successor
   Nixon. In 1969 the Nixon administration Initiated the “Philadelphia
   Order”. It was regarded as the most forceful plan thus far to guarantee
   fair hiring practices in construction jobs. Philadelphia was selected
   as the test case because, as assistant secretary of labor Arthur
   Fletcher explained, "The craft unions and the construction industry are
   among the most egregious offenders against equal opportunity laws . . .
   openly hostile toward letting blacks into their closed circle." The
   order included definite "goals and timetables." As President Nixon
   asserted, "We would not impose quotas, but would require federal
   contractors to show 'affirmative action' to meet the goals of
   increasing minority employment."^[31]

   It was through the Philadelphia Plan that the Nixon administration
   formed their adapted definition of affirmative action and became the
   official policy of the US government. The plan was defined as “racial
   goals and timetables, not quotas”^[11]^:124

Ford Administration[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Gerald Ford.

   After the Nixon administration, advancements in affirmative action
   became less prevalent. “During the brief Ford administration,
   affirmative action took a back seat, while enforcement stumbled
   along.”^[11]^:145 Equal rights was still an important subject to many
   Americans, yet the world was changing and new issues were being raised.
   People began to look at affirmative action as a glorified issue of the
   past and now there were other areas that needed focus. “Of all the
   triumphs that have marked this as America’s Century –...none is more
   inspiring, if incomplete, than our pursuit of racial justice.”^[32]

   In the first half of the twentieth century segregation was considered
   fair and normal. Fortunately because of changes made in American
   society and governmental policies the United States is past the
   traditional assumptions of race relations.^[11]^:275 Affirmative action
   has gone a long way to changing the definition of fairness and equality
   in America. The concept and application of affirmative action has
   developed since its inception, though its motivation remains the same.

   “Affirmative action is a national policy that concerns the way
   Americans feel about race, past discrimination, preferences, merit –
   and about themselves. This is why it is an American dilemma, and that
   is why we much understand how it developed and how its rationale and
   definition have changed since the 1960’s.”^[11]^:283

     * 1961 – Executive Order 10925,^[33] issued by President Kennedy

          Established the concept of affirmative action by mandating that
          projects financed with federal funds "take affirmative action"
          to ensure that hiring and employment practices are free of
          racial bias.

     * 1964 – Section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
     * 1965 – U.S. Executive Order 11246 and Executive Order 11375

          The Johnson administration embraced affirmative action in 1965,
          by issuing U.S Executive order 11246, later amended by Executive
          order 11375. The order, as amended, aims "to correct the effects
          of past and present discrimination". It prohibits federal
          contractors and subcontractors from discriminating against any
          employee or applicant for employment because of race, skin
          color, religion, gender, or national origin. The order requires
          that contractors take affirmative action to ensure that
          "protected class, underutilized applicants" are employed when
          available, and that employees are treated without negative
          discriminatory regard to their protected-class status.

          The order specifically requires certain organizations accepting
          federal funds to take affirmative action to increase employment
          of members of preferred racial or ethnic groups and women. Any
          organization with fifty or more employees and an aggregate
          revenue exceeding $50,000 from a single federal contract during
          a twelve-month period must have a written affirmative action
          plan. This plan must include goals and timetables for achieving
          full utilization of women and members of racial minorities, in
          quotas based on an analysis of the current workforce compared to
          the availability in the general labor pool of women and members
          of racial minorities.

          The order is enforced by the Office of Federal Contract
          Compliance Programs of the Employment Standards Administration
          of the U. S. Department of Labor and by the Office of Civil
          Rights of the Justice Department.

     * 1969 – Revised Philadelphia Plan

          During the Nixon administration, affirmative action was adopted
          as a federal mandate for companies with federal contracts and
          for labor unions whose workers were engaged in those projects.
          This revised Philadelphia Plan was spearheaded by Labor
          Department official Arthur Fletcher.^[34]

     * 1971 – Executive Order No. 11625,^[35] issued by President Nixon

          This order claims to build upon the Office of Minority Business
          Enterprise (MBE) established in 1969 by clarifying the Secretary
          of Commerce's authority to "(a) implement Federal policy in
          support of the minority business enterprise program; (b) provide
          additional technical and management assistance to disadvantaged
          businesses; (c) to assist in demonstration projects; and (d) to
          coordinate the participation of all Federal departments and
          agencies in an increased minority enterprise effort."

     * 1971 – Griggs v. Duke Power Company 401 U.S. 424 (1971)

          Griggs V. Duke Power Company was a court case in December of
          1970 and was ruled in favor of the prosecutor in March 1971. The
          case was arguing that Duke’s requirement of a high school
          diploma and an IQ test was discriminating against
          African-Americans. When compared to white candidates,
          African-Americans were accepted far less for positions. It was
          found that Whites that had been working the jobs who fulfilled
          neither requirement did it just as well as those who did. The
          Supreme Court ruled that under title VII of the Civil Rights Act
          that if the requirements were impeding minorities, the business
          had to demonstrate that the tests were necessary for the
          job.^[36] They ruled that these tests were not necessary, and
          Duke was found in violation of the Act.

     * 1973 – Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

          Section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
          Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require all United
          States Federal Agencies to implement affirmative employment
          opportunity programs for all federal employees. EEOC Equal
          Employment Opportunity Management Directive 715 (MD 715)
          provides guidance as to how such programs are to be implemented.

     * 1978 – Regents of the University of California v. Bakke 438 U.S.
       265 (1978)

          The Supreme Court held that the UC Davis medical school
          admissions program violated the equal protection clause with the
          institution of quotas for underrepresented minorities. However,
          Justice Lewis Powell's decision in the majority upheld diversity
          in higher education as a "compelling interest" and held that
          race could be one of the factors in university admissions.

     * 1979 – U.S. Executive Order 12138^[37]

          Issued by President Carter, this executive order created a
          National Women's Business Enterprise Policy and required
          government agencies to take affirmative action in support of
          women's business enterprises.

California[edit]

     * 1946 – Mendez v. Westminster School District
     * Penn/Stump v City of Oakland, 1967

          This Consent Decree stated that men and women should be hired by
          race and gender as police officers in the same percentage that
          they are represented in the population of the city. This process
          took more than twenty years to achieve. At the time, there were
          approximately 34 black police officers on the Oakland Police
          department and no black females among them. At this time, the
          militant Black Panther Party had formed in part due to police
          brutality at the hands of Oakland's overwhelmingly white police
          force. The City of Oakland, by contrast, had a population that
          was nearly majority African American, prompting the push for
          recruiting minority police officers.^[39]

     * Proposition 209, 1996

          This proposition mandates that "the state shall not discriminate
          against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or
          group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national
          origin in the operation of public employment, public education,
          or public contracting."[1] Prop 209 was controversial because it
          was promoted as civil rights legislation, although it was
          essentially a ban on affirmative action.^[40] Proponents argue
          that the measure ensures that the civil rights of whites and
          Asian Americans are protected by ensuring parity between races.

     * Senate Constitutional Amendment No.5, 2014

          This initiative proposed an amendment to the Constitution of the
          State to delete provisions of California Proposition 209 related
          to public education, in order to allow the State of California
          giving preferential treatment in public education to individuals
          and groups on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or
          national origin. In consequence certain individuals and groups
          may be denied their rights to public education.^[41]

Washington[edit]

     * Initiative 200, 1998

          in Washington was overwhelmingly passed by the electorate.
          Taking effect on December 3, 1998, it applies to all local
          governments, including counties, cities, and towns. I-200
          prohibits "preferential treatment" based on race, sex, color,
          ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education,
          and contracting.

     * Smith v. University of Washington 233 F.3d 1188 (9th Cir.
       2000) :^[42]
     * Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District
       No. 1, 149 Wn.2d 660, 72 P.3d 151 (2003), 2003

          The Washington State Supreme Court interpreted I-200 to forbid
          affirmative actions that promote a "less qualified" applicant
          over a "better qualified" one, but not programs that sought to
          achieve diversity without consideration of individual merit.

   In the beginning, racial classifications that identified race were
   inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. These
   classifications would only be upheld if necessary to promote a
   compelling governmental interest. Later the U.S. Supreme Court decided
   that racial classifications that benefited underrepresented minorities
   were to only be upheld if necessary and promoted a compelling
   governmental purpose. (See Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.) There is no
   clear guidance about when government action is not "compelling", and
   such rulings are rare.

Michigan[edit]

     * Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003

          The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that race could be used as one
          of several factors in professional school admissions without
          necessarily violating the equal protection clause of the 14th
          Amendment. The Court found that the University of Michigan Law
          School's narrowly tailored policy which considered race and
          other factors, with no quota or predetermined weight associated
          with the factors, was constitutional and appropriate "to further
          a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that
          flow from a diverse student body."

     * Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003

          The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the University of Michigan's
          undergraduate admissions system, which granted extra "points" to
          minorities based on race, and which determined admissions status
          based on cumulative points, was unconstitutional because it is
          too mechanical and does not appear to consider the individual's
          actual contribution to the educational environment.

          An attorney who filed an amicus brief on behalf of Pennsylvania
          legislators and former legislators in Grutter v. Bollinger, Rep.
          Mark B. Cohen of Philadelphia, said that "The cumulative effect
          of the Bakke, Grutter, and Bollinger cases is that no one has a
          legal right to have any demographic characteristic they possess
          be considered a favorable point on their behalf, but an employer
          has a right to take into account the goals of the organization
          and the interests of American society in making decisions. This
          is a moderate, inclusive position that ably balances the various
          legal interests involved."

     * Proposal 2, 2006

          After Grutter and Gratz, in November 2006, voters in the State
          of Michigan made affirmative action illegal by passing Proposal
          2 (Michigan Civil Rights Initiative), a state-wide referendum
          amending the Michigan Constitution. Proposal 2 bans public
          affirmative action programs that give preferential treatment to
          groups or individuals based on their race, gender, color,
          ethnicity or national origin for public employment, public
          education or public contracting purposes. The amendment,
          however, contains an exception for actions that are mandated by
          federal law or that are necessary in order for an institution to
          receive federal funding. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court
          upheld the ban by their ruling in Schuette v. Coalition to
          Defend Affirmative Action "that there is no authority...for the
          judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters
          the determination whether racial preferences may be considered
          in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school
          decisions."^[43]

Nebraska[edit]

     * Nebraska Civil Rights Initiative 424

          In November of 2008, Nebraska voters passed a constitutional ban
          on government-sponsored affirmative action. Initiative 424 bars
          government from giving preferential treatment to people on the
          basis of ethnicity or gender.^[44]

Arizona[edit]

   In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on
   government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107.^[45]

Connecticut[edit]

   Ricci v. DeStefano was heard by the United States Supreme Court in
   2009. The case concerns white and Hispanic firefighters in New Haven,
   Connecticut, who upon passing their test for promotions to management
   were denied the promotions, allegedly because of a discriminatory or at
   least questionable test. The test gave 17 whites and two Hispanics the
   possibility of immediate promotion. Although 23% of those taking the
   test were African American, none scored high enough to qualify. Because
   of the possibility the tests were biased in violation of Title VII of
   the Civil Rights Act,^[46]^[47] no candidates were promoted pending
   outcome of the controversy.^[48]^[49] In a split 5-4 vote, the Supreme
   Court ruled that New Haven had engaged in impermissible racial
   discrimination against the White and Hispanic majority.

New Hampshire[edit]

   As of January 1, 2012 (House Bill 623), affirmative action is not
   allowed in college admissions and employment.^[50]

Oklahoma[edit]

   During November 6, 2012 election poll, majority of Oklahoma voters
   voted 'yes' to Oklahoma Affirmative Action Ban Amendment which will end
   affirmative action in college admissions and employment.^[51]

Arguments in favor of affirmative action[edit]

   President Kennedy stated in Executive Order 10925 that "discrimination
   because of race, creed, color, or national origin is contrary to the
   Constitutional principles and policies of the United States"; that "it
   is the plain and positive obligation of the United States Government to
   promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons, without
   regard to race, creed, color, or national origin, employed or seeking
   employment with the Federal Government and on government contracts";
   that "it is the policy of the executive branch of the Government to
   encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified
   persons within the Government"; and that "it is in the general interest
   and welfare of the United States to promote its economy, security, and
   national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization
   of all available manpower".^[52]

   Some individual American states also have orders that prohibit
   discrimination and outline affirmative action requirements with regard
   to race, creed, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin,
   gender, age, and disability status.

   Proponents of affirmative action argue that by nature the system is not
   only race based, but also class and gender based. To eliminate two of
   its key components would undermine the purpose of the entire system.
   The African American Policy Forum believes that the class based
   argument is based on the idea that non-poor minorities do not
   experience racial and gender based discrimination. The AAPF believes
   that "Race-conscious affirmative action remains necessary to address
   race-based obstacles that block the path to success of countless people
   of color of all classes". The groups goes on to say that affirmative
   action is responsible for creating the African American middle class,
   so it does not make sense to say that the system only benefits the
   middle and upper classes.^[53]

   A study conducted at the University of Chicago in 2003 found that
   people with "black-sounding" names such as Lakisha and Jamal are 50
   percent less likely to be interviewed for a job compared to people with
   "white-sounding" names such as Emily or Greg.^[54]

   A recent study by Deirdre Bowen tested many of the arguments used by
   the anti-affirmative action camp. Her research showed that minority
   students experience greater hostility, and internal and external stigma
   in schools located in states that ban affirmative action—not the
   schools where students may have benefited from affirmative action
   admissions.^[55]

Example of Success in Women[edit]

   Supporters of affirmative action point out the benefits white women
   have received from the policy as evidence of its ability to assist
   historically marginalized groups. In the fifty years that
   disenfranchised groups have been actively recruited in education their
   representation has risen exponentially.^[56] So much so that white
   women are now attending college at higher rates than white men.^[57]
   Furthermore, likely building off of their educational gains, women have
   made huge strives in the workforce:

     “Thanks in large measure to affirmative action and civil rights
     protections that opened up previously restricted opportunities to
     women of all colors, from 1972-1993:

     – The percentage of women architects increased from 3% to nearly 19%
     of the total;

     – The percentage of women doctors more than doubled from 10% to 22%
     of all doctors;

     – The percentage of women lawyers grew from 4% to 23% of the
     national total;

     – The percentage of female engineers went from less than 1% to
     nearly 9%;]

     – The percentage of female chemists grew from 10% to 30% of all
     chemists; and,]

     – The percentage of female college faculty went from 28% to 42% of
     all faculty. (Moseley-Braun 1995, 8)
     Furthermore, since only 1983, the percentage of women business
     managers and professionals grew from 41% of all such persons, to
     48%, while the number of female police officers more than doubled,
     from 6% to 13% (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
     1995, Table 649). According to a 1995 study, there are at least six
     million women — the overwhelming majority of them white — who simply
     wouldn’t have the jobs they have today, but for the inroads made by
     affirmative action (Cose 1997, 171).^[58]

   Proponents of the policy see this as evidence that women have had the
   aptitude all along but have lacked the opportunity to compete with men
   on an equal playing field. They suspect this is the case with other
   groups as well, making continuation of the policy imperative for
   bridging inequalities between the white majority and minority groups.
   Although White women still suffer from unequal wages, disproportionate
   representation in traditionally feminine career fields and the glass
   ceiling barrier, the gains in numerical representation for women as a
   result of affirmative action are unmistakable.^[59]

Need to Counterbalance Historic Inequalities[edit]

   African-Americans
   Main article: Atlantic slave trade

   For the first 250 years of America's history, Black-Americans were
   traded as commodities and forced to work without pay, first as
   indentured servants then as slaves. During this time they were barred
   from all levels of education, including basic reading to higher-level
   skills useful outside of the plantation setting.
   Main article: Racial segregation in the United States

   After slavery's abolishment in 1865, Black-Americans saw the
   educational gap between themselves and whites compounded by
   segregation. They were forced to attend separate, under-funded schools
   due to Plessy v. Ferguson. Though de jure school segregation ended with
   Brown v. Board of Education, de facto segregation continues in
   education into the present day.
   Main article: G.I. Bill

   Following the end of World War II the gap educational gap between White
   and Black Americans was widened by Dwight D. Eisenhower's GI Bill. This
   piece of legislation paved the way for white GI's to attend college.
   Despite their veteran status returning black servicemen were not
   afforded loans at the same rate as whites. Furthermore at the time of
   its introduction, segregation was still the law of the land barring
   blacks from the best institutions. Overall, "Nearly 8 million
   servicemen and servicewomen were educated under the provisions of the
   GI Bill after World War II. But for blacks, higher educational
   opportunities were so few that the promise of the GI Bill went largely
   unfulfilled.^[60]"

Fair vs. Equal/Discrimination vs. Inclusion[edit]

   Proponents of affirmative action recognize that the policy is
   inherently unequal, however, minding the inescapable fact that historic
   inequalities exist in America, they believe the policy is much more
   fair than one in which these circumstances are not taken into account.
   Furthermore those in favor of affirmative action see it as an effort
   towards inclusion rather than a discriminatory practice. "Job
   discrimination is grounded in prejudice and exclusion, whereas
   affirmative action is an effort to overcome prejudicial treatment
   through inclusion. The most effective way to cure society of
   exclusionary practices is to make special efforts at inclusion, which
   is exactly what affirmative action does.^[61]"

Prominent people in support of affirmative action[edit]

   There are a multitude of supporters as well as opponents to the policy
   of affirmative action. Many presidents throughout the last century have
   failed to take a very firm stance on the policy, and the public has had
   to discern the president’s opinion for themselves. Bill Clinton,
   however, made his stance on affirmative action very clear in a speech
   on July 19, 1995, nearly two and a half years after his inauguration.
   In his speech, he discussed the history in the United States that
   brought the policy into fruition: slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation.
   Clinton also mentioned a point similar to President Lyndon B. Johnson’s
   “Freedom is not Enough” speech, and declared that just outlawing
   discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in
   America equality. He addressed the arguments that affirmative action
   hurt the white middle class and said that the policy was not the source
   of their problems. Clinton plainly outlined his stance on affirmative
   action, saying:

     “Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and
     what I won’t allow it to be. It does not mean – and I don’t favor –
     the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of
     any race or gender. It doesn’t mean – and I don’t favor – numerical
     quotas. It doesn’t mean – and I don’t favor – rejection or selection
     of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender
     without regard to merit…”

   In the end, Clinton stated that all the evidence shows that, even
   though affirmative action should be a temporary policy, the time had
   not come for it to be ended. He felt it was still a relevant practice
   and overall, the goal of the nation should be to “mend it, but don’t
   end it.” Clinton’s words became a slogan for many Americans on the
   topic of affirmative action.^[62]

Arguments against affirmative action[edit]

   Affirmative action has been the subject of numerous court cases, where
   it is often contested on constitutional grounds. Some states
   specifically prohibit affirmative action, such as California
   (Proposition 209), Washington (Initiative 200), Michigan (Michigan
   Civil Rights Initiative), and Nebraska (Nebraska Civil Rights
   Initiative).

Bias against Asians and whites[edit]

   CAPTION: College Acceptance Rates (2005)^[63]

              Overall Acceptance Rate Black Acceptance Rate  % Difference
    Harvard   10.0%                   16.7%                 + 67.0%
      MIT     15.9%                   31.6%                 + 98.7%
     Brown    16.6%                   26.3%                 + 58.4%
      Penn    21.2%                   30.1%                 + 42.0%
   Georgetown 22.0%                   30.7%                 + 39.5%

   A 2005 study by Princeton sociologists Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang
   Y. Chung compared the effects of affirmative action on racial and
   special groups at three highly selective private research universities.
   The data from the study represent admissions disadvantage and advantage
   in terms of SAT points (on the old 1600-point scale):
     * Whites: 0 (control group)
     * Blacks: +230
     * Hispanics: +185
     * Asians: –50
     * Recruited athletes: +200
     * Legacies (children of alumni): +160^[64]

   In 2009, Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and researcher
   Alexandria Walton Radford, in their book No Longer Separate, Not Yet
   Equal, examined data on students applying to college in 1997 and
   calculated that Asian-Americans needed nearly perfect SAT scores of
   1550 to have the same chance of being accepted at a top private
   university as whites who scored 1410 and African Americans who got
   1100.

   CAPTION: Medical School Acceptance Rates (2009–11)^[65]

            MCAT 24-26, GPA 3.20-3.39 MCAT 27-29, GPA 3.20-3.39 MCAT 27-29, GPA

    Asian   7.7%                      17.6%                     30.0%
    White   12.3%                     24.5%                     35.9%
   Hispanic 36.0%                     54.5%                     68.7%
    Black   67.3%                     83.3%                     85.9%

   After controlling for grades, test scores, family background (legacy
   status), and athletic status (whether or not the student was a
   recruited athlete), Espenshade and Radford found that whites were three
   times, Hispanics six times, and blacks more than 15 times as likely to
   be accepted at a US university as Asian Americans.^[66]

Mismatch Effect[edit]

   Richard Sander claims that by artificially elevating minority students
   into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending, this
   discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates
   for these students. For example, the claims^[citation needed] that
   about half of black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of
   their classes, black law school graduates are four times as likely to
   fail bar exams as are whites, and interracial friendships are more
   likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of
   academic preparation; thus, blacks and Hispanics are more socially
   integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched.[2]
   He claims that the supposed "beneficiaries" of affirmative action –
   minorities – do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the
   policy.^[67]

Class inequality[edit]

   The controversy surrounding affirmative action’s effectiveness is based
   on the idea of class inequality. Opponents of racial affirmative action
   argue that the program actually benefits middle- and upper-class
   African Americans and Hispanic Americans at the expense of lower-class
   European Americans and Asian Americans. This argument supports the idea
   of class-based affirmative action. America’s poor is disproportionately
   made up of people of color, so class-based affirmative action would
   disproportionately help people of color. This would eliminate the need
   for race-based affirmative action as well as reducing any
   disproportionate benefits for middle- and upper-class people of
   color.^[68]

   In 1976, a group of Italian American professors at City University of
   New York asked to be added as an affirmative action category for
   promotion and hiring. Italian Americans are usually considered white in
   the US and would not be covered under affirmative action policies, but
   the professors believed they were underrepresented.^[69] Libertarian
   economist Thomas Sowell wrote in his book, Affirmative Action Around
   the World: An Empirical Study, that affirmative action policies
   encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of
   preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to
   take advantage of group preference policies;

Discrimination[edit]

   Some opponents of affirmative action, like Ward Connerly, call it
   reverse discrimination, saying affirmative action requires the very
   discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these
   opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action
   counter-productive. Other opponents say affirmative action causes
   unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational
   institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for
   example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School,
   bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say
   that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive
   for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement
   (see, for example, Clarence Thomas's "My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir".)
   Some argue that affirmative action itself has some merit when it is
   targeted to true causes of social deprivation such as poverty but that
   race-, ethnicity-, or gender-based affirmative action is
   misguided.^[70]

   Some opponents^[71] further claim that affirmative action has
   undesirable side-effects and that it fails to achieve its goals. They
   argue that it hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new
   wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages
   groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are
   not.^[72] It may increase racial tension and benefit the more
   privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the
   disenfranchised within better-off groups (such as lower-class whites
   and Asians). There has recently been a strong push among American
   states to ban racial or gender preferences in university admissions, in
   reaction to the controversial and unprecedented decision in Grutter v.
   Bollinger. In 2006, nearly 60% of Michigan voters decided to ban
   affirmative action in university admissions. Michigan joined
   California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race
   or sex in admissions considerations.^[73] Some opponents believe, among
   other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of
   people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making
   affirmative action counter-productive.

Prominent people against affirmative action[edit]

   Conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the only current
   black Justice, opposes affirmative action. He believes the Equal
   Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of
   race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment.
   He also believes it creates "a cult of victimization" and implies
   blacks require "special treatment in order to succeed". Thomas also
   cites his own experiences of affirmative action programs as a reason
   for his criticism.^[74]^[75]

   Frederick Lynch, the author of Invisible Victims: White Males and the
   Crisis of Affirmative Action, did a study on white males that said they
   were victims of reverse discrimination. Lynch explains that these white
   men felt frustrated and unfairly victimized by affirmative action.^[76]
   Shelby Steele, another author against affirmative action, wanted to see
   affirmative action go back to its original meaning of enforcing equal
   opportunity. He argued that blacks had to take full responsibility in
   their education and in maintaining a job. Steele believes that there is
   still a long way to go in America to reach our goals of eradicating
   discrimination.^[77]

   Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action:
   The Case for Colorblind Justice states, “Most arguments for affirmative
   action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and
   promoting diversity”.^[78] Eastland believes that the founders of
   affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative
   action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class
   minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries
   with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement
   in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great
   risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able
   to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas
   Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative
   action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical
   Study.^[79] Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage
   non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred
   groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take
   advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit
   primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and
   middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate
   among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they
   reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to
   perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and
   the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net
   losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward
   preferred groups as well.^[80]

Implementation in universities[edit]

   In the US, a prominent form of racial preferences relates to access to
   education, particularly admission to universities and other forms of
   higher education. Race, ethnicity, native language, social class,
   geographical origin, parental attendance of the university in question
   (legacy admissions), and/or gender are sometimes taken into account
   when the university assesses an applicant's grades and test scores.
   Individuals can also be awarded scholarships and have fees paid on the
   basis of criteria listed above. In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in
   Bakke v. Regents that public universities (and other government
   institutions) could not set specific numerical targets based on race
   for admissions or employment.^[81] The Court said that "goals" and
   "timetables" for diversity could be set instead.^[81]

   The racial preferences debate related to admission to US colleges and
   universities reflects competing notions of the mission of colleges: "To
   what extent should they pursue scholarly excellence, to what extent
   civic goods, and how should these purposes be balanced?".^[82] Scholars
   such as Ronald Dworkin have asserted that no college applicant has a
   right to expect that a university will design its admissions policies
   in a way that prizes any particular set of qualities.^[83] In this
   view, admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit but
   rather a way to advance the mission as each university defines it. If
   diversity is a goal of the university and their racial preferences do
   not discriminate against applicants based on hatred or contempt, then
   affirmative action can be judged acceptable based on the criteria
   related to the mission the university sets for itself.^[82]

   Consistent with this view, admissions officers often claim to select
   students not based on academic record alone but also on commitment,
   enthusiasm, motivation, and potential.^[84] Highly selective
   institutions of higher learning do not simply select only the highest
   SAT performers to populate their undergraduate courses, but high
   performers, with scores of 2250 to 2400 points, are extraordinarily
   well-represented at these institutions.^[85]

   During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African
   American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black
   professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis
   Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies
   at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard
   undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were
   born into the African American community. The majority of black
   students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their
   children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples.
   One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose
   ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said
   that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African
   American community that they took to calling themselves "the
   descendants" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for
   this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible
   remedies, remain a subject of debate.^[86]

   UCLA professor Richard H. Sander published an article in the November
   2004 issue of the Stanford Law Review that questioned the effectiveness
   of racial preferences in law schools. He noted that, prior to his
   article, there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of
   affirmative action.^[87] The article presents a study that shows that
   half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class
   after the first year of law school and that black law students are more
   likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam.^[87] The
   article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black
   lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative
   action programs at all law schools were ended. Less qualified black
   students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more
   closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform
   relatively better.^[87] Sander helped to develop a
   socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of
   Law after the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which prohibited the
   use of racial preferences by public universities in California. This
   change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks
   at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites.

   To accommodate the ruling in Hopwood v. Texas banning any use of race
   in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing
   entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of
   their graduating class. Florida and California have also replaced
   racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to
   benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment
   of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may
   be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more
   likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue
   that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self.
   The top 10% rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still
   highly racially segregated because of residential patterns.^[88] The
   class rank rule has the same consequence as traditional affirmative
   action: opening schools to students who would otherwise not be admitted
   had the given school used a holistic, merit-based approach.^[88] From
   1996 to 1998, Texas had merit-based admission to its state
   universities, and minority enrollment dropped. The state's adoption of
   the "top 10 percent" rule returned minority enrollment to pre-1996
   levels.^[88]

   In 2006, Jian Li, a Chinese undergraduate at Yale University, filed a
   civil rights complaint with the Office for Civil Rights against
   Princeton University, claiming that his race played a role in their
   decision to reject his application for admission and seeking the
   suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it
   "discontinues discrimination against Asian Americans in all forms" by
   eliminating race and legacy preferences. Princeton Dean of Admissions
   Janet Rapelye responded to the claims in the November 30, 2006, issue
   of the Daily Princetonian by stating that "the numbers don't indicate
   [discrimination]." She said that Li was not admitted because "many
   others had far better qualifications." Li's extracurricular activities
   were described as "not all that outstanding".^[89] Li countered in an
   email, saying that his placement on the waitlist undermines Rapelye's
   claim. “Princeton had initially waitlisted my application,” Li said.
   “So if it were not for a yield which was higher than expected, the
   admissions office very well may have admitted a candidate whose
   "outside activities were not all that outstanding".^[90]

   A study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the University
   of Washington, demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action
   proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship
   universities in California, Texas, and Washington.^[91] More
   specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained
   by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and
   the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be
   white students.^[91] At the same time, affirmative action itself is
   both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace
   (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished,
   implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review
   is expected to cost the universities an additional $1.5 million to $2
   million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.^[91]

   In 2012, Abigail Fisher, an undergraduate student at Louisiana State
   University, and Rachel Multer Michalewicz, a law student at Southern
   Methodist University, filed a lawsuit to challenge the University of
   Texas admissions policy, asserting it had a "race-conscious policy"
   that "violated their civil and constitutional rights".^[92] The
   University of Texas employs the "Top Ten Percent Law", under which
   admission to any public college or university in Texas is guaranteed to
   high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high
   school class.^[93] Fisher has brought the admissions policy to court
   because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the University
   of Texas based on her race, and thus, her right to equal protection
   according to the 14th Amendment was violated.^[94] The Supreme Court
   heard oral arguments in Fisher on October 10, 2012, and rendered an
   ambiguous ruling in 2013 that sent the case back to the lower court,
   stipulating only that the University must demonstrate that it could not
   achieve diversity through other, non-race sensitive means. In July
   2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that U of
   T maintained a "holistic" approach in its application of affirmative
   action, and could continue the practice.
