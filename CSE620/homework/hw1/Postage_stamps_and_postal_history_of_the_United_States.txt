                            Postage stamp of 1895

   The history of postal service of the United States evolved from
   stampless letters, whose cost was borne by the receiving person, to
   letters carried by private mail carriers and provisional post offices,
   and then on to letters bearing adhesive postage stamps. Ship captains
   arriving in port with stampless mail would advertise in the local
   newspaper names of those having mail and for them to come collect and
   pay for it, if not already paid for by the sender.

   The postal history of the United States was rather haphazard until
   after the Revolutionary War, when eventually a national postal system
   was established. Stampless letters, paid for by the receiver, and
   private postal systems, continued until the introduction of adhesive
   postage stamps, first issued by the U.S. government post office July 1,
   1847 in the denominations of five and ten cents.

   The issue and use of adhesive postage stamps continued during the 19th
   Century primarily for first class mail. Each of these stamps generally
   bore the face or bust of an American president or another historically
   important statesman. However, once the Post Office realized during the
   1890s that it could increase revenues by selling stamps as
   "collectibles," it began issuing commemorative stamps, first in
   connection with important national expositions, later for the
   anniversaries of significant American historical events. Continued
   technological innovation subsequently prompted the introduction of
   special stamps, such as those for use with airmail, zeppelin mail,
   registered mail, certified mail, and so on. Postage due stamps were
   issued for some time and were pasted by the post office to letters
   having insufficient postage with the postage due to be paid to the
   postal carrier at the receiving address.

   Today, stamps issued by the post office are self-adhesive, and no
   longer require that the stamps be "licked" to dissolve the glue on
   their back. In many cases, post office clerks now use Postal Value
   Indicators (PVI), which are computer labels, instead of stamps.

   Where for a century-and-a-half or so, stamps were almost invariably
   denominated with their values (5 cent, 10 cent, etc.) the United States
   post office now sells non-denominated "forever" stamps for use on
   first-class and international mail. These stamps are still valid even
   if there is a rate increase. However, for other uses, adhesive stamps
   with denomination indicators are still available and sold.

Early postal history[edit]

   Postal services began in the first half of the 17th century serving the
   first American colonies; today, the United States Postal Service is a
   large government organization providing a wide range of services across
   the U.S. and its territories abroad.
   B Free Franklin Post Office in Philadelphia

   In the American colonies, informal independently-run postal routes
   began in Boston as early as 1639, with Boston to New York City service
   starting in 1672.

   Officially sanctioned mail service began in 1692 when King William III
   granted to an English nobleman a delivery "patent" that included the
   exclusive right to establish and collect a formal postal tax on
   official documents of all kinds. (Years later, taxation implemented
   through the mandatory purchase of stamps was an issue that helped to
   spark the American Revolution.) The tax was repealed a year later, and
   very few were ever actually used in the thirteen colonies, but they saw
   service in Canada and the British Caribbean islands.^[1]

   In the years leading up to the American Revolution mail routes among
   the colonies existed along the few roads between Boston, New York and
   Philadelphia. In the middle 18th century, individuals like Benjamin
   Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed
   the mails then and were the general architects of a postal system that
   started out as an alternative to the Crown Post (the colonial mail
   system then) which was now becoming more distrusted as the American
   Revolution drew near. The postal system that Franklin and Goddard
   forged out of the American Revolution became the standard for the new
   U.S. Post Office and is a system whose basic designs are still used in
   the United States Postal Service today.^[2]^[3]

Post offices and postmarks[edit]

   In 1775, when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster
   General, the U.S. Post Office was born. So important was the Postmaster
   General that in 1829 this position was included among those in the
   President's Cabinet. As America began to grow and new towns and
   villages began to appear, so too did the Post Office along with them.
   The dates and postmarks generated from these places often has provided
   the historian with a window into a given time and place in question.
   Each postmark is uniquely distinctive with its own name of state and
   town, in addition to its distinctive date. Post Offices that existed
   along railroad lines and at various military posts have their own
   special historical aspect. Mail and postmarks generated from prisoner
   of war camps during the Civil War, or from aboard naval ships, each
   with a U.S. Post Office aboard, can and have offered amazing insights
   into United States history and are avidly sought after by historians
   and collectors alike.

Mail before postage stamps[edit]

   An 1832 stampless single sheet "Liverpool Ship Letter" pen franked
   "Paid 5" by a U.S. postal clerk in Philadelphia, PA.

   Before the introduction of stamps, it was the recipient of mail—not the
   sender—who generally paid the cost of postage, giving the fee directly
   to the postman on delivery. The task of collecting money for letter
   after letter greatly slowed the postman on his route. Moreover the
   addressee would not infrequently refuse a piece of mail, which then had
   to be taken back to the Post Office (post office budgets always allowed
   for an appreciable volume of unpaid-for mail). Only occasionally did a
   sender pay delivery costs in advance, an arrangement that usually
   required a personal visit to the Post Office. To be sure, postmasters
   allowed some citizens to run charge accounts for their delivered and
   prepaid mail, but bookkeeping on these constituted another
   inefficiency.

   Postage stamps revolutionized this process, leading to universal
   prepayment; but a precondition for their issue by a nation was the
   establishment of standardized rates for delivery throughout the
   country. If postal fees were to remain (as they were in many lands) a
   patchwork of many different jurisdictional rates, the use of stamps
   would produce only limited gains in efficiency, for postal clerks would
   still have to spend time calculating the rates on many letters: only
   then would senders know how much postage to put on them.

Provisional issue stamps[edit]

                            New York Postmaster's

                              Provisional, 1845

                           Provisional stamp from

                          Providence, Rhode Island.

   The introduction of postage stamps in the UK in May 1840 was received
   with great interest in the United States (and around the world). Later
   that year, Daniel Webster rose in the U.S. Senate to recommend that the
   recent English postal reforms—standardized rates and the use of postage
   stamps—be adopted in America.^[4]

   It would be private enterprise, however, that brought stamps to the U.
   S. On February 1, 1842 a new carrier service called "City Despatch
   Post" began operations in New York City, introducing the first adhesive
   postage stamp ever produced in the western hemisphere, which it
   required its clients to use for all mail. This stamp was a 3¢ issue
   bearing a rather amateurish drawing of George Washington,^[5] printed
   from line engraved plates in sheets of 42 images. The company had been
   founded by Henry Thomas Windsor, a London merchant who at the time was
   living in Hoboken, New Jersey. Alexander M. Greig was advertised as the
   post's "agent," and as a result, historians and philatelists have
   tended to refer to the firm simply as "Greig's City Despatch Post,"
   making no mention of Windsor.^[6] In another innovation, the company
   placed mail-collection boxes around the city for the convenience of its
   customers.

   A few months after its founding, the City Despatch Post was sold to the
   U.S. Government, which renamed it the "United States City Despatch
   Post." The government began operation of this local post on August 16,
   1842, under an Act of Congress of some years earlier that authorized
   local delivery. Greig, retained by the Post Office to run the service,
   kept the firm's original Washington stamp in use, but soon had its
   lettering altered to reflect the name change. In its revised form, this
   issue accordingly became the first postage stamp produced under the
   auspices of a government in the western hemisphere.

   An Act of Congress of March 3, 1845 (effective July 1, 1845),
   established uniform (and mostly reduced) postal rates throughout the
   nation, with a uniform rate of five cents for distances under 300 miles
   (500 km) and ten cents for distances between 300 and 3000 miles.^[7]
   However, Congress did not authorize the production of stamps for
   nationwide use until 1847; still, postmasters realized that standard
   rates now made it feasible to produce and sell "provisional" issues for
   prepayment of uniform postal fees, and printed these in bulk. Such
   provisionals included both prepaid envelopes and stamps, mostly of
   crude design, the New York Postmaster's Provisional being the only one
   of quality comparable to later stamps.

   The provisional issues of Baltimore were notable for the reproduced
   signature of the city's postmaster—James M. Buchanan (1803-1876), a
   cousin to President James Buchanan. All provisional issues are rare,
   some inordinately so: at a Siegel Gallery auction in New York on March
   2012, an example of the Millbury provisional fetched $400,000,^[8]
   while copies of the Alexandria and Annapolis provisionals each sold for
   $550,000.^[9]^[10] Eleven cities printed provisional stamps in 1845 and
   1846:
   Provisional stamp issued in St. Louis, Missouri
     * Alexandria, Virginia ("ALEXANDRIA POST OFFICE" in circle)
     * Annapolis, Maryland (eagle in circle)
     * Baltimore, Maryland (James Buchanan signature)
     * Boscawen, New Hampshire ("PAID / 5 / CENTS")
     * Brattleboro, Vermont (shaded box with postmaster initials inside)
     * Lockport, New York ("LOCKPORT N.Y." in oval)
     * Millbury, Massachusetts (woodcut of George Washington)
     * New Haven, Connecticut ("POST OFFICE" in box, P.M. signature)
     * New York, New York ("POST OFFICE" over Washington portrait)
     * Providence, Rhode Island ("POST OFFICE / PROV. R.I." in shaded box)
     * St. Louis, Missouri (St. Louis Bears, Missouri coat of arms)

   (See also:A Gallery of U. S. Postmasters' Provisional Stamps, 1845-47.)

   The 1845 Congressional act did, in fact, raise the rate on one
   significant class of mail: the so-called “drop letter”—i. e., a letter
   delivered from the same post office that collected it. Previously one
   cent, the drop letter rate became two cents.

First national postage stamps[edit]

                   Benjamin Franklin and George Washington

                        The First U.S. Postage Stamps

                                 Issued 1847

   The first stamp issues were authorized by an act of Congress and
   approved on March 3, 1847.^[11] The earliest known use of the Franklin
   5¢ is July 7, 1847, while the earliest known use of the Washington 10¢
   is July 2, 1847. Remaining in postal circulation for only a few years,
   these issues were declared invalid for postage on July 1, 1851.^[12]

   Congress finally provided for the issuance of stamps by passing an act
   on March 3, 1847, and the Postmaster-General immediately let a contract
   to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and
   Edson.^[13] The first stamp issue of the U.S. was offered for sale on
   July 1, 1847, in New York City, with Boston receiving stamps the
   following day and other cities thereafter. They consisted of an
   engraved 5-cent red brown stamp depicting Benjamin Franklin (the first
   postmaster of the U.S.), and a 10-cent value in black with George
   Washington. Like all U.S. stamps until 1857, they were imperforate.

   The 5-cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than 1 ounce and
   traveling less than 300 miles, the 10-cent stamp for deliveries to
   locations greater than 300 miles, or, twice the weight deliverable for
   the 5-cent stamp. Each stamp was hand engraved in what is believed to
   be steel, and laid out in sheets of 200 stamps. The 5-cent stamp is
   often found today with very poor impressions because the type of ink
   used contained small pieces of quartz that wore down the steel plates
   used to print the stamp. On the other hand, most 10-cent stamps are of
   strong impressions. A fresh and brilliantly printed 5-cent stamp is
   prized by collectors.

   The use of stamps was optional: letters could still be sent requiring
   payment of postage on delivery. Indeed, the post office issued no
   2-cent value for prepaying drop letters in 1847, and these continued to
   be handled as they had been. Nevertheless many Americans took up using
   stamps; about 3,700,000 of the 5¢ and about 865,000 of the 10¢ were
   sold, and enough of those have survived to ensure a ready supply for
   collectors, although the demand is such that a very fine 5¢ sells for
   around $500 as of 2003, and the 10¢ in very fine condition sells for
   around $1,400 in used form. Unused stamps are much scarcer, fetching
   around $6,000 and $28,000 respectively, if in very fine condition. One
   can pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of these figures if the stamps are
   in poor condition.

   The post office had become so efficient by 1851 that Congress was able
   to reduce the common rate to three cents (which remained unchanged for
   over thirty years), necessitating a new issue of stamps. Moreover, the
   common rate now applied to letters carried up to 3000 miles. This rate,
   however, only applied to prepaid mail: a letter sent without a stamp
   still cost the recipient five cents—clear evidence that Congress
   envisioned making stamp use mandatory in the future (it did so in
   1855). The 1-cent drop-letter rate was also restored, and Post Office
   plans did not at first include a stamp for it; later, however, an essay
   for a 6-cent Franklin double-weight stamp was converted into a
   drop-letter value. Along with this 1¢ stamp, the post office initially
   issued only two additional denominations in the series of 1851: 3¢ and
   12¢, the three stamps going on sale that July and August. Since the
   1847 stamps no longer conformed to any postal rate, they were declared
   invalid after short period during which the public could exchange old
   stamps for new ones. Ironically, however, within a few years the Post
   Office found that stamps in the old denominations were needed after
   all, and so, added a 10¢ value to the series in 1855, followed by a 5¢
   stamp the following year. The full series included a 1¢ profile of
   Franklin in blue, a 3¢ profile of Washington in red brown, a 5¢
   portrait of Thomas Jefferson, and portraits of Washington for 10¢ green
   and 12¢ black values. The 1¢ stamp achieved notoriety, at least among
   philatelists, because production problems (the stamp design was too
   tall for the space provided) led to a welter of plate modifications
   done in piecemeal fashion, and there are no fewer than seven major
   varieties, ranging in price from $100 to $200,000 (the latter for the
   only stamp of the 200 images on the first plate that displays the
   design's top and bottom ornamentation complete). Sharp-eyed collectors
   periodically find the rare types going unrecognized.

   1857 saw the introduction of perforation, and in 1860 24¢, 30¢ and 90¢
   values (with still more images of Washington and Franklin) were issued
   for the first time. These higher denominations, especially the 90c
   value, were available for such a short time (a little over a year) that
   they had virtually no chance of being used. The 90c stamp used is a
   very rare item, and so frequently forged that authorities counsel
   collectors to shun cancelled copies that lack expert
   certification.^[12]

   In February 1861, a congressional act directed that “cards, blank or
   printed. . .shall also be deemed mailable matter, and charged with
   postage at the rate of one cent an ounce.” Private companies soon began
   issuing post cards, printed with a rectangle in the top right corner
   where the stamp was to be affixed. (The Post Office would not produce
   pre-stamped “postal cards” for another dozen years.)

   The issue was declared invalid for postage in May 1861, as the
   Confederate States had supplies of them. Therefore, stamps used after
   that date usually have the marking "OLD STAMPS/NOT RECOGNIZED" on the
   cover.

Issues of the Civil War era[edit]

                                Issue of 1863

   The outbreak of the American Civil War threw the postal system into
   turmoil. On April 13, 1861, (the day after the firing on Fort Sumter)
   John H. Reagan, postmaster-general of the Confederate States of
   America, ordered local postmasters to return their U.S. stamps to
   Washington D.C. (although it is unlikely that many did so), while in
   May the Union decided to withdraw and invalidate all existing U.S.
   stamps, and to issue new stamps. Confederate post offices were left
   without legitimate stamps for several months, and while many reverted
   to the old system of cash payment at the post office, over 100 post
   offices across the South came up with their own provisional issues.
   Many of these are quite rare, with only single examples surviving of
   some types. Eventually the Confederate government issued its own
   stamps; see stamps and postal history of the Confederate States.

   In the North, the new stamp designs became available in August, and old
   stamps were accepted in exchange until the end of the year. The whole
   process was very confusing to the public, and there are number of
   covers from 1862 and later with 1857 stamps and bearing the marking
   "OLD STAMPS NOT RECOGNIZED".

   The 1861 stamps had in common the letters "U S" in their design. To
   make them differentiable from the older stamps at a glance, all were
   required to have their values expressed in Arabic numerals (in the
   previous series, Arabic numerals had appeared only on the 30¢ stamp).
   The original issue included all the denominations offered in the
   previous series: 1¢, 3¢, 5¢, 10¢, 12¢, 24¢, 30¢ and 90¢ stamps.
   Numerals apart, several of these are superficially similar to their
   earlier counterparts—particularly because Franklin, Washington and
   Jefferson still appear on the same denominations as previously.
   Differences in the design of the frames are more readily apparent.

   A 2¢ stamp in black featuring Andrew Jackson was issued in 1863 and is
   now known to collectors as the "Black Jack". A black 15¢ stamp
   depicting the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln was issued in 1866,
   and is generally considered part of the same series. Although it was
   not officially described as such, and the 15¢ value was chosen to cover
   newly established fee for registered letters, many philatelists
   consider this to be the first memorial stamp ever issued.

   The war greatly increased the amount of mail in the North; ultimately
   about 1,750,000,000 copies of the 3¢ stamp were printed, and a great
   many have survived to the present day, typically selling for 2-3
   dollars apiece. Most are rose-colored; pink versions are much rarer and
   quite expensive, especially the "pigeon blood pink", which goes for
   $3,000 and up.

   The stamps of the 1861 series, unlike those of the two previous issues,
   remained valid for postage after they had been superseded—as has every
   subsequent United States stamp.

Pony Express[edit]

   In 1860, the U.S. Post Office incorporated the services of the Pony
   Express to get mail to and from San Francisco, an important undertaking
   with the outbreak of the Civil War, as a communication link between
   Union forces and San Francisco and the West Coast was badly needed. The
   Pony Express Trail from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento,
   California, was 1,840 miles long. Upon arrival in Sacramento, the U.S.
   mail was placed on a steamer and continued down the Sacramento River to
   San Francisco for a total of 1,966 miles. The Pony Express was a
   short-lived enterprise, remaining in operation for only 18 months.
   Consequently, there is little surviving Pony Express mail today, only
   250 examples known in existence.

Encased postage stamps[edit]

   Encased.jpg

   Widespread hoarding of coins during the Civil War created a shortage,
   prompting the use of stamps for currency. To be sure, the fragility of
   stamps made them unsuitable for hand-to-hand circulation, and to solve
   this problem, John Gault invented the encased postage stamp in 1862. A
   normal U. S. stamp was wrapped around a circular cardboard disc and
   then placed inside a coin-like circular brass jacket. A transparent
   mica window in the jacket allowed the face of the stamp to be seen. All
   eight denominations available in 1861-62, ranging from 1 cent to 90
   cents, were offered in encased versions. Raised lettering on the metal
   backs of the jackets often advertised the goods or services of business
   firms; these included the Aerated Bread Company; Ayers Sarsaparilla and
   Cathartic Pills; Burnett’s Cocoaine; Sands Ale; Drake’s Plantation
   Bitters; Buhl & Co. Hats and Furs; Lord & Taylor; Tremont House,
   Chicago; Joseph L. Bates Fancy Goods; White the Hatter, New York City;
   and Ellis McAlpin & Co. Dry Goods, Cincinnati.^[14]^[15]^[16]

Grills[edit]

   "G" grill on an 1869 issue
   Main article: Grill (philately)

   During the 1860s, the postal authorities became concerned about postage
   stamp reuse. Although there is little evidence that this occurred
   frequently, many post offices had never received any canceling devices.
   Instead, they improvised a canceling process by scribbling on the stamp
   with an ink pen ("pen cancellation"), or whittling designs in pieces of
   cork, sometimes very creatively ("fancy cancels"), to mark the stamps.
   However, since poor-quality ink could be washed from the stamp, this
   method would only have been moderately successful. A number of
   inventors patented various ideas to attempt to solve the problem.

   The Post Office eventually adopted the grill, a device consisting of a
   pattern of tiny pyramidal bumps that would emboss the stamp, breaking
   up the fibers so that the ink would soak in more deeply, and thus be
   harder to clean off. While the patent survives (No. 70,147), much of
   the actual process of grilling was not well documented, and there has
   been considerable research trying to recreate what happened and when.
   Study of the stamps shows that there were eleven types of grill in use,
   distinguished by size and shape (philatelists have labeled them with
   letters A-J and Z), and that the practice started some time in 1867 and
   was gradually abandoned after 1871. A number of grilled stamps are
   among the great rarities of US philately. The United States 1¢ Z grill
   was long thought to be the rarest of all U.S. stamps, with only two
   known to exist. In 1961, however, it was discovered that the 15¢ stamp
   of the same series also existed in a Z grill version; this stamp is
   just as rare as the 1¢, for only two examples of the 15¢ Z grill are
   known.^[17] Rarer still may be the 30¢ stamp with the I Grill, the
   existence of which was discovered only recently: as of October 2011,
   only one copy is known.^[18]

1869[edit]

   Main article: 1869 Pictorial Issue
   SS Adriatic, 1869
   Horse & rider, Pony Express

   In 1868, the Post Office contracted with the National Bank Note Company
   to produce new stamps with a variety of designs. These came out in
   1869, and were notable for the variety of their subjects; the 2¢
   depicted a Pony Express rider, the 3¢ a locomotive, the 12¢ the
   steamship Adriatic, the 15¢ the landing of Christopher Columbus, and
   the 24¢ the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

   Other innovations in what has become known as the 1869 Pictorial Issue
   included the first use of two-color printing on U.S. stamps, and as a
   consequence the first invert errors. Although popular with collectors
   today, the unconventional stamps were not very popular among a
   population who was accustomed to postage that bore classic portrayals
   of Washington, Franklin and other forefathers. Consequently the Post
   Office recalled all remaining stocks after one year.

                                 1870 issue

   The postage stamps issued in the 1870s and 1880s are collectively known
   as the "Bank Notes" because they were produced by the National Bank
   Note Company, the Continental Bank Note Company, then the American Bank
   Note Company. After the 1869 fiasco with pictorial stamp issues, the
   new Postmaster-General decided to base a series of stamps on the
   "heads, in profile, of distinguished deceased Americans" using "marble
   busts of acknowledged excellence" as models. George Washington was
   returned to the normal-letter-rate stamp: he had played that role in
   the issues of 1851 and 1861 and would continue to do so in every
   subsequent definitive set until the Presidential Series of 1938. The
   various subjects on the remaining denominations included both
   presidents and other notables, such as Henry Clay and Oliver Hazard
   Perry. National first printed these, then in 1873 Continental received
   the contract—and the plates that National used. Continental added
   secret marks to the plates of the lower values, distinguishing them
   from the previous issues. The American Bank Note Company acquired
   Continental in 1879 and took over the contract, printing similar
   designs on softer papers and with some color changes. Major
   redesigning, however, came only in 1890, when the American Bank Note
   Company issued a new series in which stamp-size was reduced by about
   10% (the so-called "Small Bank Notes").

   In 1873, the Post Office began producing a pre-stamped post card. One
   side was printed with a Liberty-head one-cent stamp design, along with
   the words “United States Postal Card” and three blank lines provided
   for the mailing address. Six years later, it introduced a series of
   seven Postage Due stamps in denominations ranging from 1¢ to 50¢, all
   printed in the same brownish-red color and conforming to the same
   uniform and highly utilitarian design, with their denominations
   rendered in numerals much larger than those found on definitive stamps.
   The design remained unchanged until 1894, and only four different
   postage due designs have appeared to date.

   In 1883, the first-class letter rate was reduced from 3¢ to 2¢,
   prompting a redesign of the existing 3¢ green Washington stamp, which
   now became a 2¢ brown issue.

Special Delivery[edit]

                     First Special Delivery stamp, 1885

   In 1885 the Post Office established a Special Delivery service, issuing
   a ten-cent stamp depicting a running messenger, along with the wording
   “secures immediate delivery at a special delivery office.” Initially,
   only 555 such offices existed but the following year all U. S. Post
   Offices were obliged to provide the service—an extension not, however,
   reflected on the Special Delivery stamp until 1888, when the words “at
   any post office” appeared on its reprint. (On stamps of future years,
   the messenger would be provided the technological enhancements of a
   bicycle [1902] a motorcycle [1922] and a truck [1925]. Although the
   last new U.S. Special Delivery stamp appeared issued in 1971, the
   service was continued until 1997, by which time it had largely been
   supplanted by Priority Mail delivery, introduced in 1989.) The 1885
   Special Delivery issue was the first U.S. postage stamp designed in the
   double-width format. Eight years later, this shape would be chosen for
   the Columbian Exposition commemoratives, as it offered appropriate
   space for historical tableaux. The double-width layout would
   subsequently be employed in many United States Commemoratives.

Columbian Issue[edit]

                       Landing of Christopher Columbus

                                Issue of 1893

   Main article: Columbian Issue

   The World Columbian Exposition of 1893 commemorated the 400th
   anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. The
   Post Office got in on the act, issuing a series of 16 stamps depicting
   Columbus and episodes in his career, ranging in value from 1¢ to $5 (a
   princely sum in those days). They are often considered the first
   commemorative stamps issued by any country.

   The stamps were interesting and attractive, designed to appeal to not
   only postage stamps collectors but to historians, artists and of course
   the general public who bought them in record numbers because of the
   fanfare of the Columbian Exposition of the World's Fair of 1892 in
   Chicago, Illinois.

   They were quite successful (a great contrast to the pictorials of
   1869), with lines spilling out of the nation's post offices to buy the
   stamps. They are prized by collectors today with the $5 denomination,
   for example, selling for between $1,500 to $12,500 or more, depending
   upon the condition of the stamp being sold.

   Another release in connection with the Columbian series was a reprint
   of the 1888 Special Delivery stamp, now colored orange (reportedly, to
   prevent postal clerks from confusing it with the 1¢ Columbian). After
   sales of the series ceased, the Special Delivery stamp reappeared in
   its original blue.

Bureau issues[edit]

   George Washington on 2-cent Bureau issue clearly showing the triangles
   in the upper corners

   Also during 1893, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing competed for the
   postage stamp printing contract, and won it on the first try. For the
   postage issues of the 1894 series, the Bureau took over the plates of
   the 1890 small banknote series but modified them by adding triangles to
   the upper corners of the designs. Three new designs were needed,
   because the Post Office elected to add $1, $2 and $5 stamps to the
   series (previously, the top value of any definitive issue had been
   90¢). On many of the 1894 stamps, perforations are of notably poor
   quality, but the Bureau would soon make technical improvements. In 1895
   counterfeits of the 2¢ value were discovered, which prompted the BEP to
   begin printing stamps on watermarked paper for the first time in U.S.
   postal history. The watermarks imbedded the logo U S P S into the paper
   in double-lined letters. The Bureau's definitive issues of the 1890s
   consisted of 13 different denominations ranging from 1 cent to 5
   dollars, and may be differentiated by the presence or absence of this
   watermark, which would appear on all U. S. Postage stamps between 1895
   and 1910.^[12] The final issue of 1898 altered the colors of many
   denominations to bring the series into conformity with the
   recommendations of the Universal Postal Union (an international body
   charged with facilitating the course of transnational mail). The aim
   was to ensure that in all its member nations, stamps for given classes
   of mail would appear in the same colors. Accordingly, U.S. 1¢ stamps
   (postcards) were now green and 5¢ stamps (international mail) were now
   blue, while 2¢ stamps remained red. (As a result, it was also necessary
   to replace the blue and green on higher values with other colors.) U.S.
   postage continued to reflect this color-coding quite strictly until the
   mid-1930s, continuing also in the invariable use of purple for 3¢
   stamps.

Start of the 20th century[edit]

   Trans Mississippi Issue, 1898-1c

   In 1898, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition opened in Omaha, Nebraska,
   and the Post Office was ready with the Trans-Mississippi Issue. The
   nine stamps were originally to be two-toned, with black vignettes
   surrounded by colored frames, but the BEP, its resources overtaxed by
   the needs of the Spanish-American War, simplified the printing process,
   issuing the stamps in single colors. They were received favorably,
   though with less excitement than the Columbians; but like the
   Columbians, they are today prized by collectors, and many consider the
   $1 "Western Cattle in Storm"^[19] the most attractive of all U.S.
   stamps.
   Pan-American Issue, 1901-2c

   Collectors, still smarting from the expense of the Columbian stamps,
   objected that inclusion of $1 and $2 issues in the Trans-Mississippi
   series presented them with an undue financial hardship.^[20]
   Accordingly, the next stamp series commemorating a prominent
   exposition, the Pan-American Exposition held in Buffalo, New York in
   1901, was considerably less costly, consisting of only five stamps
   ranging from in value 1¢ to 10¢. The result, paradoxically, was a
   substantial increase in Post Office profits; for, while the higher
   valued Columbians and Trans-Mississippis had sold only about 20,000
   copies apiece, the public bought well over five million of every
   Pan-American denomination.^[21] In the Pan-American series^[22] the
   Post Office realized the plan for two-toned stamps that it had been
   obliged to abandon during the production of the Trans-Mississippi
   issue. Upside-down placement of some sheets during the two-stage
   printing process resulted in the so-called Pan-American invert errors
   on rare copies of the 1¢, 2¢ and 4¢ stamps.

Definitive issues of 1902-1903[edit]

   Main article: Series of 1902

   The definitive stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1902-1903 were
   markedly different in their overall designs from the regular definitive
   stamps released over the previous several decades. Among the prominent
   departures from tradition in these designs was that the names of the
   subjects were printed out, along with their years of birth and death.
   (Printed names and birth and death dates are more typically a feature
   of Commemorative stamps.) Unlike any definitive stamps ever issued
   before, the 1902-03 issues also had ornate sculptural frame work
   redolent of Beaux-Arts architecture about the portrait, often including
   allegorical figures of different sorts, with several different types of
   print used to denote the country, denominations and names of the
   subjects. This series of postage stamps were the first definitive
   issues to be entirely designed and printed by the Bureau of Engraving
   and Printing, and their Baroque revival style is much akin to that of
   the Pan-American commemoratives the Bureau had issued in 1901. There
   are fourteen denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars. The 2-cent
   George Washington stamp appeared with two different designs (the
   original version was poorly received) while each of the other values
   has its own individual design.^[12]^[23] This was the first U.S.
   definitive series to include the image of a woman: Martha Washington,
   who appeared on the 8-cent stamp.

Commemorative issues, 1904-1907[edit]

   In these years, the postal service continued to produce commemorative
   sets in conjunction with important national expositions. The Louisiana
   Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri in 1904 prompted a set of
   five stamps,^[24] while a trio of stamps commemorated the Jamestown
   Exposition, held in Norfolk, Virginia in 1907.^[25]

Washington-Franklin era[edit]

   Main article: Washington-Franklin Issues

   1908 saw the beginning of the long-running Washington-Franklin series
   of stamps. Although there were only two central images, a profile of
   Washington and one of Franklin, many subtle variants appeared over the
   years; for the Post Office experimented with half-a-dozen different
   perforation sizes, two kinds of watermarking, three printing methods,
   and large numbers of values, all adding to several hundred distinct
   types identified by collectors. Some are quite rare, but many are
   extremely common; this was the era of the postcard craze, and almost
   every antique shop in the U.S. will have some postcards with green 1¢
   or red 2¢ stamps from this series. In 1910 the Post Office began
   phasing out the double-lined watermark, replacing it by the same U S P
   S logo in smaller single-line letters. Watermarks were discontinued
   entirely in 1916.

                                                     issue of 1918

   Toward the beginning of the Washington-Franklin era, in 1909, the Post
   Office issued its first individual commemorative stamps—three single 2¢
   issues honoring, respectively, the Lincoln Centennial, the Alaska-Yukon
   Exposition, and the tercentennial/centennial Hudson-Fulton Celebration
   in New York.^[26] A four-stamp series commemorating the Panama-Pacific
   Exposition in San Francisco, California appeared in 1913,^[27] but no
   further commemoratives were issued until after World War I.

                           20¢ Parcel Post Stamp

   Issued in 1912, this was the first time in history an airplane appeared
   on a postage stamp.

   It was also in 1913, in January, that the Post Office introduced
   domestic parcel post service (a belated development, given that
   international parcel post service between the United States and other
   countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps
   intended for this service had already been released in December 1912,
   ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and
   designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values
   illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher
   denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and
   Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared
   concurrently. It soon became obvious that none of these stamps was
   needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or
   commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for
   parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were
   replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one
   denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series—20¢—had proved
   useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin
   issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.

   On November 3, 1917, the normal letter rate was raised from 2¢ to 3¢ in
   support of the war effort. The rate hike was reflected in the first
   postwar commemorative—a 3¢ "victory" stamp released on March 3, 1919
   (not until July 1 would postal fees return to peacetime levels). Only
   once before (with the Lincoln Memorial issue of 1909) had the Post
   Office issued a commemorative stamp unconnected to an important
   national exposition; and the appearance of the Pilgrim Tercentenary
   series in 1920 confirmed that a new policy was developing: the Post
   Office would no longer need the pretext of significant patriotic trade
   fairs to issue commemoratives: they could now freely produce stamps
   commemorating the anniversaries of any notable historical figures,
   organizations or events.

The 1920s and 1930s[edit]

   1923 Freedom, $5, blue and red

   The stamps of the 1920s were dominated by the Series of 1922, the first
   new design of definitive stamps to appear in a generation. The lower
   values mostly depicted various presidents, with the 5c particularly
   intended as a memorial of the recently deceased Theodore Roosevelt,
   while the higher values included an "American Indian" (Hollow Horn
   Bear), the Statue of Liberty, Golden Gate (without the bridge, which
   had yet to be built), Niagara Falls, a bison, the Lincoln Memorial and
   so forth. Higher values of the series (from 17¢ through $5) were
   differentiated from the cheaper stamps by being designed in horizontal
   (landscape) rather than vertical format, an idea carried over from the
   "big Bens" of the Washington-Franklin series.

                         Regular Issues 1922–1925

   Stamp printing was switching from a flat plate press to a rotary press
   while these stamps were in use, and most come in two perforations as a
   result; 11 for flat plate, and 11x10.5 for rotary. In 1929, theft
   problems in the Midwest led to the Kansas-Nebraska overprints on the
   regular stamps. (See also: Fourth Bureau issue).

   From 1924 on, commemorative stamps appeared every year. The 1920s saw a
   number of 150th anniversaries connected with the American Revolutionary
   War, and a number of stamps were issued in connection with those. These
   included the first U.S. souvenir sheet, for the Battle of White Plains
   sesquicentennial, and the first overprint, reading "MOLLY / PITCHER",
   the heroine of the Battle of Monmouth.

Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926–1932[edit]

             Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926–1932

   During this period, the U.S. Post Office issued more than a dozen 'Two
   Cent Reds' commemorating the 150th anniversaries of Battles and Events
   that occurred during the American Revolution. The first among these was
   the Liberty Bell 150th Anniversary Issue of 1926, designed by Clair
   Aubrey Huston, and engraved by J.Eissler & E.M.Hall, two among
   America's most renowned master engravers. The 'Two Cent Reds' were
   among the last stamps used to carry a letter for 2 cents, the rate
   changing to 3 cents on July 6, 1932. The rate remained the same for 26
   years until it finally changed to 4 cents in 1958.

Graf Zeppelin stamps[edit]

   65-cent "Zeppelin" of 1930, issued in April for the May–June
   Pan-American flight of the Graf Zeppelin

   The German zeppelins were of much interest during this period, and in
   1930 the Department issued special stamps to be used on the
   Pan-American flight of Graf Zeppelin.

   Although the Graf Zeppelin stamps are today highly prized by collectors
   as masterpieces of the engraver's art, in 1930 the recent stock market
   crash meant that few were able to afford these stamps (the $4.55 value
   for the set represented a week's food allowance for a family of four).
   Less than 10 percent of the 1,000,000 of each denomination issued were
   sold and the remainders were incinerated (the stamps were only
   available for sale to the public from April 19, 1930, to June 30,
   1930). It is estimated that less than 8 percent of the stamps produced
   survive today and they remain the smallest U.S. issue of the 20th
   century (only 229,260 of these stamps were ever purchased, and only
   61,296 of the $2.60 stamp were sold).

   In 1932, a set of 12 stamps was issued to celebrate the George
   Washington's 200th birthday 1932 Washington Bicentennial. For the 2¢
   value, which satisfied the normal letter rate, the most familiar
   Gilbert Stuart image of Washington had been chosen. After postal rates
   rose that July, this 2¢ red Washington was redesigned as a 3¢ stamp and
   issued in the purple color that now became ubiquitous among U.S.
   commemoratives.

The New Deal Era[edit]

   In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt became President. He was notable not
   only as an avid collector in his own right (with a collection estimated
   at around 1 million stamps), but also for taking an interest in the
   stamp issues of the Department, working closely with Postmaster James
   Farley, the former Democratic Party Committee Chairman. Many designs of
   the 1930s were inspired or altered according to Roosevelt's advice. In
   2009-10, the National Postal Museum exhibited six Roosevelt sketches
   that were developed into stamp issues: the 6-cent eagle airmail stamp
   and five miscellaneous commemoratives, which honored the Byrd Antarctic
   Expedition, the Mothers of America, Susan B. Anthony, Virginia Dare and
   the Northwest Territories' rise to statehood. A steady stream of
   commemoratives appeared during these years, including a striking 1934
   issue of ten stamps presenting iconic vistas of ten National Parks—a
   set that has remained widely beloved. (In a memorable sequence from
   Philip Roth’s novel The Plot Against America, the young protagonist
   dreams that his National Parks stamps, the pride and joy of his
   collection, have become disfigured with swastika overprints.) Choosing
   an orange color for the 2¢ Grand Canyon tableau instead of the standard
   2¢ carmine red, the Post Office departed from U. P. U. color-coding for
   the first time.

                            National Parks Issue

    1936 Souvenir sheet reproducing four recent three-cent commemoratives

   With a philatelist in the White House, the Post Office catered to
   collectors as never before, issuing seven separate souvenir sheets
   between 1933 and 1937. In one case, a collectors' series had to be
   produced as the result of a miscalculation. Around 1935, Postmaster
   Farley removed sheets of the National Parks set from stock before they
   had been gummed or perforated, giving these and unfinished examples of
   ten other issues to President Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Harold
   Ickes (also a philatelist) as curiosities for their collections. When
   word of these gifts got out, public outcries arose. Some accused Farley
   of a corrupt scheme to enrich Roosevelt and Ickes by creating valuable
   rarities for them at taxpayer expense. Stamp aficionados, in turn,
   demanded that these curiosities be sold to the public so that ordinary
   collectors could acquire them, and Farley duly issued them in bulk.
   This series of special printings soon became known as “Farley’s
   Follies.” As the decade progressed, the purples used for 3¢ issues,
   although still ostensibly conforming to the traditional purple,
   displayed an increasingly wide variety of hues, and one 1940 issue, a
   3¢ stamp commemorating the Pony Express, dispensed with purple
   entirely, appearing in a rust brown earth tone more suitable to the
   image of a horse and rider departing from a western rural post office.

Presidential Issue of 1938[edit]

                         Presidential issue of 1938

   Main article: Presidential Issue

   The famous Presidential Issue, known as "Prexies" for short, came out
   in 1938. The series featured all 29 U.S. presidents through Calvin
   Coolidge, each of whom appeared in profile as a small sculptural bust.
   Values of 50¢ and lower were mono-colored; on the $1, $2, and $5 stamps
   the presidents' images were printed in black on white, surrounded by
   colored lettering and ornamentation. Up through the 22¢ Cleveland
   stamp, the denomination assigned to each president corresponds to his
   position in the presidential roster: thus the first president,
   Washington, is on the 1¢ value, the seventeenth, Andrew Johnson, is on
   the 17¢ value, etc. Additional stamps depict Franklin (½¢), Martha
   Washington (1½¢), and the White House (4½¢). Many of the values were
   included merely to place the presidents in proper numerical order and
   did not necessarily correspond to a postal rate; and one of the
   (difficult) games for Prexie collectors is to find a cover with, for
   instance, a single 16¢ stamp that pays a combination of rate and fees
   valid during the Prexies' period of usage. Many such covers remain to
   be discovered; some sellers on eBay have been surprised to discover an
   ordinary-seeming cover bid up to several hundred dollars because it was
   one of the sought-after solo usages. The Presidential issue remained in
   distribution for many years. Not until 1954 did the Post Office begin
   replacing its values with the stamps of a new definitive issue, the
   Liberty series.

Famous Americans Series of 1940[edit]

   In 1940, the U.S. Post Office issued a set of 35 stamps, issued over
   the course of approximately ten months, commemorating America's famous
   Authors, Poets, Educators, Scientists, Composers, Artists and
   Inventors. The Educators included Booker T. Washington, who now became
   the first African-American to be honored on a U.S. stamp. This series
   of Postage issues was printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
   These stamps were larger in size than normal definitive issues, with
   only 280 stamp images contained on the printing plate (400 images was
   standard for the Presidential series). Notable also is the red-violet
   color chosen for the 3¢ stamps, a brighter hue than the traditional
   purple.

World War II[edit]

                                 Scott # 905

   During World War II, production of new U. S. 3¢ commemorative stamps
   all but ceased. Among the three issues that appeared in 1942^[28] was
   the celebrated Win the War stamp, which enjoyed enormously wide use,
   owing partly to patriotism and partly to the relative unavailability of
   alternatives. It presents an eagle posed in a "V" shape for victory
   surrounded by 13 stars. The eagle is grasping arrows, but has no olive
   branch. A notable commemorative set did, indeed, appear in 1943-44, but
   its stamps, all valued at 5 cents, were not competitive with the Win
   the War issue. This was the Overrun Countries series (known to
   collectors as the Flag set), produced as a tribute to the thirteen
   nations that had been occupied by the Axis Powers.^[29]

   The thirteen stamps present full color images of the national flags of
   Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium,
   France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Austria, Denmark, and Korea, with
   the names of the respective countries written beneath. To the left of
   each flag appears the image of the phoenix, which symbolizes the
   renewal of life, and to its right appears a kneeling female figure with
   arms raised, breaking the shackles of servitude.^[30]

                          Overrun Countries stamps

   The stamps with flags of European countries were released at intervals
   from June to December 1943, while the Korea flag stamp was released in
   November 1944.^[31] These stamps were priced at 5 cents, although the
   standard cost for a first class stamp was 3 cents. These stamps were
   intended for use on V-mail, a means whereby mail intended for military
   personnel overseas was delivered with certainty.

   The service persons overseas used the same method for writing letters
   home, and the same process was used to reconstruct their letters,
   except that their postage was free.

   The two-cent surcharge on the V-mail letters helped pay for the
   additional expense of this method of delivery.

   Because of the elaborate process necessary for the full-color printing,
   the Bureau of Engraving and Printing contracted with a private firm,
   the American Bank Note Company, to produce the series - the first U. S.
   stamps to be printed by a private company since 1893. Uniquely among U.
   S. issues, the sheets lack the plate numbers usually printed on the
   selvage surrounding the stamps. In the places where the numbers
   normally appear on each sheet, the name of the country is substituted,
   engraved in capital letters.

Post-World War II[edit]

   The post-World War II stamp program followed a consistent pattern for
   many years: a steady stream of commemorative issues sold as single
   stamps at the first-class letter rate. While the majority of these were
   designed in the double-width format, an appreciable number issued in
   honor of individuals conformed instead to the format, size, general
   design style and red-violet hue used in the 1940 Famous Americans
   series.

                            George W. Carver 1948

   The Postal Service had become increasingly lax about employing purple
   for 3¢ stamps, and after the war, departures from that color in
   double-width commemoratives veritably became the rule rather than the
   exception (although U. P. U. colors and purple for 3¢ stamps would
   continue to be used in the definitive issues of the next decades).
   Beginning in 1948, Congressional Representatives and Senators began to
   push the Post Office for stamps proposed by constituents, leading to a
   relative flood of stamps honoring obscure persons and organizations.
   Stamp issue did not again become well regulated until the formation of
   the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) in 1957.

   The Liberty issue of 1954, deep in the Cold War, took a much more
   political slant than previous issues. The common first-class stamp was
   a 3¢ Statue of Liberty in purple, and included the inscription "In God
   We Trust", the first explicit religious reference on a U.S. stamp (ten
   days before the issue of the 3¢ Liberty stamp, the words "under God"
   had been inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance). The Statue of Liberty
   appeared on two additional higher values as well, 8¢ and 11¢, both of
   which were printed in two colors. The other stamps in the series
   included liberty-related statesmen and landmarks, such as Patrick Henry
   and Bunker Hill, although other subjects, (Benjamin Harrison, for
   example) seem unrelated to the basic theme.

   In 1957, the American Flag was featured on a U. S. stamp for the first
   time. The Post Office had long avoided this image, fearing accusations
   that, in issuing stamps on which they would be defacing the flag by
   cancellation marks, they would be both committing and fomenting
   desecration. However, protests against this initial flag issue were
   muted, and the flag has remained a perennially popular U. S. stamp
   subject ever since.

   The 3¢ rate for first-class had been unchanged since 1932, but by 1958
   there were no more efficiency gains to keep the lid on prices,^[32] and
   the rate went to 4¢, beginning a steady series of rate increases that
   reached 46¢ as of January 27, 2013.^[33]

   The Prominent Americans series superseded the "Liberties" in the 1960s
   and proved the last definitive issue to conform to the Universal Postal
   Union color code. In the 1970s, they were replaced by the Americana
   series, in which colors became purely a matter of designer preference.

   In 1971, the Post Office was reorganized, becoming the United States
   Postal Service (USPS). However, it is still heavily regulated, with,
   for instance, the CSAC continuing to decide which commemorative stamps
   to issue.

Air Mail[edit]

   1918 6c was the same design as the notable 24-cent Inverted Jenny
   variety of this series
   Main articles: Airmails of the United States and List of United States
   airmail stamps

   Airmail in the United States Post Office emerged in three stages
   beginning with the 'pioneer period'^[34] where there were many
   unofficial flights carrying the mail prior to 1918, the year the US
   Post Office assumed delivery of all Air Mail. The US Post office began
   contracting out to the private sector to carry the mail (Contract Air
   Mail, CAM) on February 15, 1926. In 1934, all US Air Mail was carried
   by the U.S. Army for six months, after which the contract system
   resumed.

Abraham Lincoln postage issues[edit]

   In 1866, about a year after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, the U.S.
   Post Office issued its first postage stamp honoring the fallen
   President. The Post Office stated that the release took place on June
   17. Some sources, however, believe that the stamp was introduced on
   April 14, the one-year anniversary of Lincoln's death, and one notable
   expert made an (unverifiable) claim that the stamp first saw use on
   April 15.^[20] In any case, it is considered by some as America's first
   commemorative stamp. From that point on Lincoln's portrait appeared on
   a variety of US postage stamps and today exists on more than a dozen
   issues. Lincoln is also honored on commemorative stamps issued by Costa
   Rica and Nicaragua. With the exceptions of George Washington and
   Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln appears on US Postage more than any other
   famous American.^[12]

Modern U.S. stamps[edit]

   5¢ George Washington, 1962

   The first self-adhesive stamp was a 10 cent stamp from the Christmas
   issue of 1974. It was not considered successful, and the surviving
   stamps, though not rare, are all gradually becoming discolored due to
   the adhesive used. Self-adhesives were not issued again until 1989,
   gradually becoming so popular that as of 2004^[update], only a handful
   of types are offered with the traditional gum (now affectionately
   called "manual stamps" by postal employees).

   The increasing frequency of postal rate increases from the 1970s on,
   and the necessity to wait for these to be approved by Congress, made it
   problematic for the Postal Service to provide stamps matching the
   increased costs in a timely manner. Until it was known, for example,
   whether the new first-class rate would be 16c or, instead, 15c, no
   denominated stamp could be printed. The Postal Service found a way to
   bypass this problem in 1978. Preparatory to that year’s increase, an
   orange colored stamp with a simple eagle design appeared bearing the
   denomination "A" instead of a number; and the public was informed that
   this stamp would satisfy the new first-class rate, whatever it turned
   out to be. Subsequent rate increases resulted in B, C and D stamps,
   which bore the same eagle design but were printed, respectively, in
   purple, buff-brown and blue-green. When it came time for an E stamp in
   1987, the Postal Service commissioned a more elaborate design: a color
   picture of the globe as seen from space (E for Earth). Rises since have
   prompted F for Flower, G for Old Glory and H for Hat stamps, all
   appropriately illustrated. The F stamp in 1991 was accompanied by an
   undenominated "make-up" stamp with no pictorial design beyond a frame,
   which enclosed the words "This U. S. stamp, along with 25c of
   additional U. S. postage, is equivalent to the 'F' stamp rate."

   The Great Americans series and the Transportation coils began appearing
   in 1980 and 1981, respectively. The transportation coils were used
   steadily for some 20 years, while Great Americans was replaced by the
   Distinguished Americans series, which began in 2000.^[35]

   The increasing use of email and other technologies during the 1990s led
   to a decline in the amount of first-class mail, while bulk mail
   increased. A large variety of commemorative stamps continue to appear,
   but more of them just go to collectors, while the stamps of the average
   person's daily mail are non-denominated types issued specifically for
   businesses.^[citation needed]

   In 2005, after 111 years of producing American postage stamps, the
   Bureau of Engraving and Printing ended its involvement with the postal
   service.

   On April 12, 2007, the Forever stamp went on sale for 41 cents, and is
   good for mailing one-ounce First-Class letters anytime in the
   future—regardless of price changes. In 2011, the Post Office began
   issuing all new stamps for First-Class postage—both definitives and
   commemoratives—as Forever stamps: denominations were no longer included
   on them.

   On February 25, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the
   Federal Circuit ruled 2-1 that Frank Gaylord, sculptor of a portion of
   the Korean War Veterans Memorial, was entitled to compensation when an
   image of that sculpture was used on a 37 cent postage stamp because he
   had not signed away his intellectual property rights to the sculpture
   when it was erected. The appeals court rejected arguments that the
   photo was transformative.^[36] In 2006 sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted
   Fish & Richardson to make a pro bono claim that the Postal Service had
   violated his Intellectual property rights to the sculpture and thus
   should have been compensated. The Postal Service argued that Gaylord
   was not the sole sculptor (saying he had received advice from federal
   sources—who recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind) and
   also that the sculpture was actually architecture. Gaylord won all of
   his arguments in the lower court except for one: the court ruled the
   photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation.
   Gaylord appealed and won the case on appeal. The case can now either be
   appealed to the United States Supreme Court or damages can be assessed
   by the lower court.^[36]

   Later in the 2010, automated stamp and bank automatic teller machines
   began dispensing thinner stamps. The thin stamps were to make it easier
   for automated stamp machines to dispense and to make the stamps more
   environmentally friendly.^[37]

   On January 26, 2014, the postal service raised the price of First-class
   postage stamps to 49 cents. Rates for other mail, including postcards
   and packages, also increased.^[38]

New stamps[edit]

   Twelve criteria for new stamps and postal stationery^[39] include that
   "events of historical significance shall be considered for
   commemoration only on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years." For many
   years, these included the restriction that "no postal item will be
   issued sooner than five years after the individual's death," with an
   exception provided for stamps memorializing recently deceased U.S.
   Presidents. In September 2011, however, the postal service announced
   that, in an attempt to increase flagging revenues, stamps would soon
   offer images of celebrated living persons, chosen by the Committee in
   response to suggestions submitted by the public via surface mail and
   social networks on the Internet. The revised criterion reads: "The
   Postal Service will honor living men and women who have made
   extraordinary contributions to American society and culture."^[39]

   On June 14, 2008, in Washington, DC, the Postal Service issued the
   first set of 10 designs in the 42–cent Flags of Our Nation stamps. The
   stamps were designed by Howard E. Paine of Delaplane, Virginia. Five
   subsequent sets of ten stamps each had appeared by August 16, 2012,
   bringing the total of stamp designs to sixty. Sets nos. 3 and 4 were
   denominated 44-cents, while the final two sets appeared as Forever
   stamps.^[40]^[41]

   In August 2014, former Postmaster General Benjamin F. Bailar complained
   that the USPS was "prostituting" its stamps by focusing on stamps
   centered on popular culture, not cultural icons. He claims that this is
   a move aimed at making up for the USPS' revenue shortage at the expense
   of the values of the stamp program.^[42]
