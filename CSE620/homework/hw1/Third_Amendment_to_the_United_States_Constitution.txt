   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives

   The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution
   places restrictions on the quartering of soldiers in private homes
   without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime. The
   amendment is a response to Quartering Acts passed by the British
   parliament during the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the
   British Army to lodge soldiers in private residences.

   The Third Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison
   as a part of the United States Bill of Rights, in response to
   Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress proposed
   the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15,
   1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it.
   Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the
   amendment on March 1, 1792.

   The amendment is one of the least controversial of the Constitution and
   is rarely litigated. As of 2012, it had never been the primary basis of
   a Supreme Court decision.^[1]^[2]^[3]

Text[edit]

     No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house,
     without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a
     manner to be prescribed by law.^[4]

Background[edit]

   In 1769, the British parliament enacted the first of the Quartering
   Acts, requiring the American colonies to pay the costs of British
   soldiers serving in the colonies, and requiring that if the local
   barracks provided insufficient space, that the colonists lodge the
   troops in alehouses, inns, and livery stables. After the Boston Tea
   Party, the Quartering Act of 1774 was enacted. One of the Intolerable
   Acts that pushed the colonies toward revolution, it authorized British
   troops to be housed wherever necessary, including in private homes.^[5]
   The quartering of troops was cited as one of the colonists' grievances
   in the United States Declaration of Independence.^[2]

Adoption[edit]

   After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles
   of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed
   a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief
   executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention
   delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed
   that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be
   included. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights drafter James
   Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil
   liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual
   rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were
   unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a
   unanimous vote of the state delegations.^[6]

   For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen
   states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to
   ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's
   lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the
   Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification
   (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed
   that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for
   the addition of a bill of rights. Several state conventions
   specifically proposed a provision against the quartering of troops in
   private homes.^[2] At the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention, Patrick
   Henry stated, "One of our first complaints, under the former
   government, was the quartering of troops among us. This was one of the
   principal reasons for dissolving the connection with Great Britain.
   Here we may have troops in time of peace. They may be billeted in any
   manner — to tyrannize, oppress, and crush us."^[5]

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   James Madison, drafter of the Bill of Rights

   In the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures'
   request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based
   on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights
   1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in
   private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were
   proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed in the way in which peace
   and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation,
   such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the
   executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize
   quartering.^[7] However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress
   almost unchanged and by unanimous vote.^[2] Congress reduced Madison's
   proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the
   states for ratification on September 25, 1789.^[8]

   By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for
   ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists,
   who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as
   a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism.
   Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the
   Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second
   constitutional convention, which they desired.^[9] Anti-Federalists
   such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most
   objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal
   judiciary and direct taxation, intact.^[10]

   On November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve
   amendments, rejecting Article II, which regulated Congressional pay
   raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North
   Carolina ratified all twelve amendments.^[11] On January 19, 25, and
   28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware
   ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on
   Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected Article I, which
   regulated the size of the House.^[11] This brought the total of
   ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in
   other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights
   unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most
   of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary
   of State that it had done so.^[10]^[a]

   In February through June of 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode
   Island ratified eleven of the amendments, though all three rejected the
   amendment on Congressional pay raises. Virginia initially postponed its
   debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total
   number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont
   ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and
   Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791.^[10] Secretary of State
   Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully
   ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.^[12]

Judicial interpretation[edit]

   Justice William O. Douglas

   The Third Amendment is among the least cited sections of the U.S.
   Constitution.^[13] In the words of Encyclopedia Britannica, "as the
   history of the country progressed with little conflict on American
   soil, the amendment has had little occasion to be invoked."^[14] As of
   2012, no major Supreme Court decision has used the amendment as its
   primary basis.^[2]^[3]

   The Third Amendment has been invoked in a few instances as helping
   establish an implicit right to privacy in the Constitution.^[15]
   Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along with others in the
   Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in Griswold
   v. Connecticut (1965),^[16] which cited the Third Amendment as implying
   a belief that an individual's home should be free from agents of the
   state.^[15]

   In one of the seven opinions in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer
   (1952), Justice Robert H. Jackson cited the Third Amendment as
   providing evidence of the Framers' intent to constrain executive power
   even during wartime:^[15]

     "[t]hat military powers of the Commander in Chief were not to
     supersede representative government of internal affairs seems
     obvious from the Constitution and from elementary American history.
     Time out of mind, and even now in many parts of the world, a
     military commander can seize private housing to shelter his troops.
     Not so, however, in the United States, for the Third Amendment
     says...[E]ven in war time, his seizure of needed military housing
     must be authorized by Congress."^[17]

   One of the few times a federal court was asked to invalidate a law or
   action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982).^[18]
   In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were
   evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to
   members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as
   prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second
   Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes
   tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment,
   governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as
   soldiers for the purposes of the Third Amendment, and (3) that the
   Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the
   states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.^[19] The case was
   remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds
   that state officials could not have been aware of this
   interpretation.^[20]

   In an earlier case, United States v. Valenzuela (1951),^[21] the
   defendant asked that a federal rent-control law be struck down because
   it was "the incubator and hatchery of swarms of bureaucrats to be
   quartered as storm troopers upon the people in violation of Amendment
   III of the United States Constitution."^[22] The court declined his
   request. Later, in Jones v. United States Secretary of Defense
   (1972),^[23] Army reservists unsuccessfully cited the Third Amendment
   as justification for refusing to march in a parade. Similar arguments
   in a variety of contexts have been denied in other cases.^[24]
