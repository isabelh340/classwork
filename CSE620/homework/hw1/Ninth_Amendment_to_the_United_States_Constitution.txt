Text[edit]

     The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
     construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.^[1]

Background prior to adoption[edit]

   When the U.S. Constitution was put to the states for ratification after
   being signed on September 17, 1787, the Anti-Federalists argued that a
   Bill of Rights should be added. One of the arguments the Federalists
   gave against the addition of a Bill of Rights, during the debates about
   ratification of the Constitution, was that a listing of rights could
   problematically enlarge the powers specified in Article One, Section 8
   of the new Constitution by implication. For example, in Federalist 84,
   Alexander Hamilton asked, "Why declare that things shall not be done
   which there is no power to do?"^[2] Likewise, James Madison explained
   to Thomas Jefferson, "I conceive that in a certain degree ... the
   rights in question are reserved by the manner in which the federal
   powers are granted"^[3] by Article One, Section 8 of the Constitution.

   The Anti-Federalists persisted in favor of a Bill of Rights during the
   ratification debates, but also were against ratification, and
   consequently several of the state ratification conventions gave their
   assent with accompanying resolutions proposing amendments to be added.
   In 1788, the Virginia Ratifying Convention attempted to solve the
   problem that Hamilton and the Federalists had identified by proposing a
   constitutional amendment specifying:^[4]

     That those clauses which declare that Congress shall not exercise
     certain powers be not interpreted in any manner whatsoever to extend
     the powers of Congress. But that they may be construed either as
     making exceptions to the specified powers where this shall be the
     case, or otherwise as inserted merely for greater caution.

   This proposal ultimately led to the Ninth Amendment.

   In 1789, while introducing to the House of Representatives nineteen^[5]
   draft Amendments, James Madison addressed what would become the Ninth
   Amendment as follows:^[6]

     It has been objected also against a Bill of Rights, that, by
     enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would
     disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration;
     and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not
     singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the
     General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of
     the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission
     of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may
     be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by
     turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.

   Like Alexander Hamilton, Madison was concerned that enumerating various
   rights could "enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution."^[6] To
   attempt to solve this problem, Madison submitted this draft to
   Congress:

     The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution, made in favor
     of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the
     just importance of other rights retained by the people; or as to
     enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as
     actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater
     caution.^[6]

   This was an intermediate form of the Ninth Amendment that borrowed
   language from the Virginia proposal, while foreshadowing the final
   version.

   The final text of the Ninth Amendment, like Madison's draft, speaks of
   other rights than those enumerated in the Constitution. The character
   of those other rights was indicated by Madison in his speech
   introducing the Bill of Rights (emphasis added):

     It has been said, by way of objection to a bill of rights....that in
     the Federal Government they are unnecessary, because the powers are
     enumerated, and it follows, that all that are not granted by the
     constitution are retained; that the constitution is a bill of
     powers, the great residuum being the rights of the people; and,
     therefore, a bill of rights cannot be so necessary as if the
     residuum was thrown into the hands of the Government. I admit that
     these arguments are not entirely without foundation, but they are
     not as conclusive to the extent it has been proposed. It is true the
     powers of the general government are circumscribed; they are
     directed to particular objects; but even if government keeps within
     those limits, it has certain discretionary powers with respect to
     the means, which may admit of abuse.^[6]

   The First through Eighth Amendments address the means by which the
   federal government exercises its enumerated powers, while the Ninth
   Amendment addresses a "great residuum" of rights that have not been
   "thrown into the hands of the government," as Madison put it.^[6] The
   Ninth Amendment became part of the Constitution on December 15, 1791
   upon ratification by three-fourths of the states.

Judicial interpretation[edit]

   The Ninth Amendment has generally been regarded by the courts as
   negating any expansion of governmental power on account of the
   enumeration of rights in the Constitution, but the Amendment has not
   been regarded as further limiting governmental power. The U.S. Supreme
   Court explained this, in U.S. Public Workers v. Mitchell 330 U.S. 75
   (1947): "If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of
   invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments,
   must fail."

   The Supreme Court held in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) that the Amendment
   was enforceable by the federal courts only against the federal
   government, and not against the states. Thus, the Ninth Amendment
   originally applied only to the federal government, which is a
   government of enumerated powers.

   Some jurists have asserted that the Ninth Amendment is relevant to
   interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Arthur Goldberg
   (joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Brennan)
   expressed this view in a concurring opinion in the case of Griswold v.
   Connecticut (1965):

     The Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be
     construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights.... I do not
     mean to imply that the .... Ninth Amendment constitutes an
     independent source of rights protected from infringement by either
     the States or the Federal Government....While the Ninth Amendment -
     and indeed the entire Bill of Rights - originally concerned
     restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth
     Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental
     personal liberties. And, the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not
     all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight
     amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other
     fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as
     federal, infringement. In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends
     strong support to the view that the "liberty" protected by the Fifth
     and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal
     Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically
     mentioned in the first eight amendments. Cf. United Public Workers
     v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 94-95.

   Since Griswold, some judges have tried to use the Ninth Amendment to
   justify judicially enforcing rights that are not enumerated. For
   example, the District Court that heard the case of Roe v. Wade ruled in
   favor of a "Ninth Amendment right to choose to have an abortion,"
   although it stressed that the right was "not unqualified or
   unfettered." ^[7] However, Justice William O. Douglas rejected that
   view; Douglas wrote that, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not
   create federally enforceable rights." See Doe v. Bolton (1973). Douglas
   joined the majority opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe, which
   stated that a federally enforceable right to privacy, "whether it be
   founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and
   restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District
   Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the
   people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not
   to terminate her pregnancy."^[8]

   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated in Gibson v. Matthews, 926
   F.2d 532, 537 (6th Cir. 1991) that the Ninth Amendment was intended to
   vitiate the maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius according to
   which the express mention of one thing excludes all others:

     [T]he ninth amendment does not confer substantive rights in addition
     to those conferred by other portions of our governing law. The ninth
     amendment was added to the Bill of Rights to ensure that the maxim
     expressio unius est exclusio alterius would not be used at a later
     time to deny fundamental rights merely because they were not
     specifically enumerated in the Constitution.

   Justice Antonin Scalia has expressed the view, in the dissenting
   opinion of Troxel v. Granville 530 U.S. 57 (2000), that:

     The Declaration of Independence...is not a legal prescription
     conferring powers upon the courts; and the Constitution’s refusal to
     'deny or disparage' other rights is far removed from affirming any
     one of them, and even farther removed from authorizing judges to
     identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges’ list against
     laws duly enacted by the people.

Scholarly interpretation[edit]

   Professor Laurence Tribe shares the view that this amendment does not
   confer substantive rights: "It is a common error, but an error
   nonetheless, to talk of 'ninth amendment rights.' The ninth amendment
   is not a source of rights as such; it is simply a rule about how to
   read the Constitution."^[9]

   In 2000, Harvard historian Bernard Bailyn gave a speech at the White
   House on the subject of the Ninth Amendment. He said that the Ninth
   Amendment refers to "a universe of rights, possessed by the people —
   latent rights, still to be evoked and enacted into law....a reservoir
   of other, unenumerated rights that the people retain, which in time may
   be enacted into law."^[10] Similarly, journalist Brian Doherty has
   argued that the Ninth Amendment "specifically roots the Constitution in
   a natural rights tradition that says we are born with more rights than
   any constitution could ever list or specify."^[11]

   Robert Bork, often considered an originalist, stated during his Supreme
   Court confirmation hearing that a judge should not apply a
   constitutional provision like this one if he does not know what it
   means; the example Bork then gave was a clause covered by an inkblot.
   Upon further study, Bork later ascribed a meaning to the Ninth
   Amendment in his book The Tempting of America. In that book, Bork
   subscribed to the interpretation of constitutional historian Russell
   Caplan, who asserted that this Amendment was meant to ensure that the
   federal Bill of Rights would not affect provisions in state law that
   restrain state governments.^[12]

   A libertarian originalist, Randy Barnett, has argued that the Ninth
   Amendment requires what he calls a presumption of liberty. Barnett also
   argues that the Ninth Amendment prevents the government from
   invalidating a ruling by either a jury or lower court through strict
   interpretation of the Bill of Rights.^[12]

   Still others, such as Thomas B. McAffee, have argued that the Ninth
   Amendment protects the unenumerated "residuum" of rights which the
   federal government was never empowered to violate.^[13]

   According to lawyer and diplomat Frederic Jesup Stimson, the framers of
   the Constitution and the Ninth Amendment intended that no rights that
   they already held would be lost through omission. Law professor Charles
   Lund Black took a similar position, though Stimson and Black
   respectively acknowledged that their views differed from the modern
   view, and differed from the prevalent view in academic
   writing.^[14]^[15]

   Gun rights activists in recent decades have sometimes argued for a
   fundamental natural right to keep and bear arms in the United States
   that both predates the U.S. Constitution and is covered by the
   Constitution's Ninth Amendment; according to this viewpoint, the Second
   Amendment only enumerates a pre-existing right to keep and bear
   arms.^[16]

Recapitulation[edit]

   The Ninth Amendment explicitly bars denial of unenumerated rights if
   the denial is based on the enumeration of certain rights in the
   Constitution, but this amendment does not explicitly bar denial of
   unenumerated rights if the denial is based on the enumeration of
   certain powers in the Constitution.^[17] It is to that enumeration of
   powers that the courts have pointed, in order to determine the extent
   of the unenumerated rights mentioned in the Ninth Amendment.^[17]

     It was at first believed by our greatest judges and jurists that the
     whole English Constitution was implied in the Federal Constitution ;
     that there is, as it were, an unwritten Constitution which we
     inherited in America and which consisted, not only of the English
     Constitution where not expressly altered by our own, but of all
     matters of natural right and justice. Doubtless this is the intended
     meaning of the Ninth Amendment…. Such is not, perhaps, the modern
     view ; but the question has become, in fact, academic, for the
     reason that in 120 years of interpretation our Supreme Court has
     ever found some clause in the Federal Constitution into which to
     read any English constitutional principle not therein expressly
     altered.
