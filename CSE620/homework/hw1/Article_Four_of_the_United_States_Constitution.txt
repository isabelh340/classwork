Section 1: Full faith and credit[edit]

   Main article: Full Faith and Credit Clause

     Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public
     Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And
     the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such
     Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect
     thereof.

   The first section requires states to extend "full faith and credit" to
   the public acts, records and court proceedings of other states.
   Congress may regulate the manner in which proof of such acts, records
   or proceedings may be admitted.

   In Mills v. Duryee, 1t1 U.S. (7 Cranch) 481 (1813), the United States
   Supreme Court ruled that the merits of a case, as settled by courts of
   one state, must be recognized by the courts of other states; state
   courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the
   courts of another state. Later, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested
   that the judgment of one state court must be recognized by other
   states' courts as final. However, in McElmoyle v. Cohen, 38 U.S. (13
   Pet.) 312 (1839), the court heard a case where one party obtained a
   judgment in South Carolina and sought to enforce it in Georgia, which
   had a statute of limitations that barred actions on judgments after a
   certain amount of time had passed since the judgment was entered. The
   court upheld Georgia's refusal to enforce the South Carolina judgment.
   The court found that out-of-state judgments are subject to the
   procedural law of the states where they are enforced, notwithstanding
   any priority accorded in the states in which they are issued.

Section 2: Obligations of states[edit]

Clause 1: Privileges and Immunities[edit]

   Main article: Privileges and Immunities Clause

     The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and
     Immunities of Citizens in the several States.

   Clause One of Section 2 requires interstate protection of "privileges
   and immunities". The seeming ambiguity of the clause has given rise to
   a number of different interpretations. Some contend that the clause
   requires Congress to treat all citizens equally. Others suggest that
   citizens of states carry the rights accorded by their home states while
   traveling in other states.

   Neither of these theories has been endorsed by the Supreme Court, which
   has held that the clause means that a state may not discriminate
   against citizens of other states in favor of its own citizens. In
   Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1823), the federal
   circuit court held that privileges and immunities in respect of which
   discrimination is barred include

     protection by the Government; the enjoyment of life and liberty ...
     the right of a citizen of one State to pass through, or to reside in
     any other State, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional
     pursuits, or otherwise; to claim the benefits of the writ of habeas
     corpus; to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts
     of the State; to take, hold and dispose of property, either real or
     personal; and an exemption from higher taxes or impositions than are
     paid by the other citizens of the State.

   Most other benefits were held not to be protected privileges and
   immunities. In Corfield the circuit court sustained a New Jersey law
   giving state residents the exclusive right to gather clams and oysters.

Clause 2: Extradition of fugitives[edit]

   Main article: Extradition Clause

     A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime,
     who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on
     demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled,
     be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of
     the Crime.

   Clause Two requires that fugitives from justice may be extradited on
   the demand of executive authority of the state from which they flee.
   The Supreme Court has held that it is not compulsory for the fugitive
   to have fled after an indictment was issued, but only that the fugitive
   fled after having committed the crime. The Constitution provides for
   the extradition of fugitives who have committed "treason, felony or
   other crime." That phrase incorporates all acts prohibited by the laws
   of a state, including misdemeanors and small, or petty, offenses.

   In Kentucky v. Dennison, 65 U.S. 66 (1860), the Supreme Court held that
   the federal courts may not compel state governors to surrender
   fugitives through the issue of writs of mandamus. The Dennison decision
   was overruled by Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U.S. 219 (1987); now, the
   federal courts may require the extradition of fugitives.^[1] Alleged
   fugitives generally may not challenge extradition proceedings.

   The motives of the governor demanding the extradition may not be
   questioned. The accused cannot defend himself against the charges in
   the extraditing state; the fugitive must do so in the state receiving
   him. However, the accused may prevent extradition by offering clear
   evidence that he was not in the state he allegedly fled from at the
   time of the crime.^[2] There is no constitutional requirement that
   extradited fugitives be tried only for the crimes named in the
   extradition proceedings.

   Fugitives brought to states by means other than extradition may be
   tried, even though the means of the conveyance was unlawful; the
   Supreme Court so ruled in Mahon v. Justice, 127 U.S. 700 (1888). In
   Mahon a body of armed men from Kentucky forcibly took, without a
   warrant, a man in West Virginia to bring him back to Kentucky for
   formal arrest and trial.

Clause 3: Fugitive Slave Clause[edit]

   Main article: Fugitive Slave Clause

     No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws
     thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or
     Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but
     shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or
     Labour may be due.

   Pierce Butler and Charles Pinckney, both from South Carolina, submitted
   this clause to the Constitutional Convention. James Wilson of
   Pennsylvania objected, stating it would require that state governments
   to enforce slavery at taxpayers' expense. Butler withdrew the clause.
   However, on the next day the clause was quietly reinstated and adopted
   by the Convention without objection. This clause was added to the
   clause that provided extradition for fugitives from justice.^[3]

   When first adopted, this clause applied to fugitive slaves and required
   that they be extradited upon the claims of their masters, but it
   provided no means for doing so. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 created
   the mechanism for recovering a fugitive slave, overruled any state laws
   giving sanctuary, made it a federal crime to assist an escaped slave,
   and allowed slave-catchers into every U.S. state and territory. As free
   states sought to undermine the federal law, the even more severe
   Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was enacted.

   In 1864, during the Civil War, an effort to repeal this clause of the
   Constitution failed.^[4] This clause was rendered mostly moot when the
   Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery.

Section 3: New states and federal property[edit]

Clause 1: New states[edit]

     New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no
     new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any
     other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more
     States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures
     of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.

   By Section Three, Congress may admit new states to the Union. Admission
   was planned for Vermont after settlement of border issues with New
   York. No new state, however, may be formed by joining multiple states,
   without the consent of all state legislatures concerned.

   The Constitution does not require that states be admitted on an "equal
   footing" with the original states. In fact, the Constitutional
   Convention rejected a proposal requiring the equality of new states.
   Congress nevertheless included an equality clause in the statehood acts
   of admission of states. Congressional restrictions on the equality of
   states, even when those limitations have been found in the acts of
   admission, have been held void by the Supreme Court.

   For instance the Supreme Court struck down a provision which limited
   the jurisdiction of the state of Alabama over navigable waters within
   the state. The Court held,

     Alabama is, therefore, entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction
     over all the territory within her limits ... to maintain any other
     doctrine, is to deny that Alabama has been admitted into the union
     on an equal footing with the original states ... to Alabama belong
     the navigable waters and soils under them.

   The doctrine, however, can also be applied to the detriment of states,
   as occurred with Texas. Before admission to the Union, Texas, as an
   independent nation, controlled water within three miles of the coast,
   the normal limit for nations. Under the equal footing doctrine,
   however, Texas was found not to have control over the three-mile belt
   after admission into the Union, because the original states did not at
   the time of joining the union control such waters. Instead, by entering
   the Union, Texas was found to have surrendered control over the water
   and the soil under it to Congress. Under the Submerged Lands Act of
   1953, Congress returned maritime territory to some states, but not to
   others; the Act was sustained by the Supreme Court.

   During the Civil War, the people of western Virginia rejected the state
   convention's decision to secede from the Union. This region formed a
   new government for the state of Virginia, which President Abraham
   Lincoln immediately recognized. In 1863 this state legislature
   permitted its western counties to split off and become the state of
   West Virginia. Congress recognized West Virginia, as did the Supreme
   Court in Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39 (1871).^[5]

   The question of leaving the Union is not addressed by the Constitution.
   In Texas v. White, 74 U.S. 700 (1869), the Supreme Court suggested that
   the Constitution ordained the "perpetuity and indissolubility of the
   Union". The court did allow some possibility of the divisibility
   "through revolution, or through consent of the States."^[6]^[7]

Clause 2: Federal Property and Territory Clause[edit]

     The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful
     Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property
     belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution
     shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United
     States, or of any particular State.^[8]

   The Federal Property and Territory Clause or Property Clause gives the
   United States Congress power to dispose of, and make all needful rules
   and regulations regarding territories or other property owned by United
   States. Additionally, the clause also proclaims that nothing contained
   within the constitution - may be interpreted to harm (prejudice)- any
   claim of: the United States, or, of any particular State.

   Pursuant to a parallel clause in Article One, Section Eight, the
   Supreme Court has held that states may not tax such federal property.
   In another case, Kleppe v. New Mexico, the Court ruled that the Federal
   Wild Horse and Burro Act was a constitutional exercise of congressional
   power under the Property Clause at least insofar as it was applied to a
   finding of trespass against the New Mexico Livestock Board prohibiting
   them from entering upon the public lands of the United States and
   removing wild burros under the New Mexico Estray Law.^[9]

   A major issue early in the 20th century was whether the whole
   Constitution applied to the territories called insular areas by
   Congress. In a series of opinions by the Supreme Court of the United
   States, referred to as the Insular Cases, the Court ruled that
   territories belonged to, but were not part of the United States.
   Therefore, under the Territorial clause Congress had the power to
   determine which parts of the Constitution applied to the territories.
   These rulings have helped shape public opinion among Puerto Ricans
   during the ongoing debate over the commonwealth's political status.

Section 4: Obligations of the United States[edit]

Clause 1: Republican government[edit]

     The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
     Republican Form of Government, [...]

   This clause, sometimes referred to as the Guarantee Clause, has long
   been at the fore-front of the debate about the rights of citizens
   vis-à-vis the government. The Guarantee Clause mandates that all U.S.
   states must be grounded in republican principles, such as consent of
   the governed. ^[10] By ensuring that all states must have the same type
   of government (a republic), the Guarantee Clause is one of several
   portions of the Constitution which mandates symmetric federalism
   between the states.

   The Constitution does not explain what exactly constitutes a republican
   government. There are however, several places within it where the
   principles behind the concept are articulated. Article Seven, the last
   and shortest of the Constitution's original articles, stipulated that
   the Constitution, before it could become established as the "Law of the
   Land", must obtain the consent of the people by being ratified by
   popular conventions within the several states. Additionally, as it
   required the ratification of only nine states in order to become
   established, rather than the unanimous consent required by the Articles
   of Confederation, the Constitution was more republican, as it protected
   the majority from effectively being ruled or held captive by the
   minority.^[11]

   The Federalist Papers also give us some insight as to the intent of the
   Founders. A republican form of government is distinguished from a
   democracy which the Founding Fathers had no intentions of entering. As
   James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 10, "Hence it is that such
   democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention;
   have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights
   of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they
   have been violent in their deaths."

   A political crisis in 1840s Rhode Island, the Dorr Rebellion, forced
   the Supreme Court to rule on the meaning of this clause. At the time,
   the Rhode Island constitution was the old royal charter established in
   the 17th century. By the 1840s, only 40% of the state's free white
   males were enfranchised. An attempt to hold a popular convention to
   write a new constitution was declared insurrection by the charter
   government, and the convention leaders were arrested. One of them
   brought suit in federal court, arguing that Rhode Island's government
   was not "republican" in character, and that his arrest (along with all
   of the government's other acts) were invalid. In Luther v. Borden, 48
   U.S. 1 (1849), the Court held that the determination of whether a state
   government is a legitimate republican form as guaranteed by the
   Constitution is a political question to be resolved by the Congress. In
   effect, the court held the clause to be non-justiciable.

   The Luther v. Borden ruling left the responsibility to establish
   guidelines for the republican nature of state governments in the hands
   of the Congress. This power became an important part of Reconstruction
   after the American Civil War. The Radical Republican majority used this
   clause as the basis for many of their initiatives: the uncompensated
   abolition of slavery, civil rights for freedmen, plus the limiting of
   political and voting rights for ex-Confederates, abolishing the
   ex-Confederate state governments, setting guidelines for the
   readmission of the rebellious states into the Union.

   While the Supreme Court's holding in Luther v. Borden still holds
   today, the Court, by looking to the Equal Protection Clause of the
   Fourteenth Amendment (adopted 19 years after Luther v. Borden was
   decided), has developed a new criteria for determining which questions
   are political in nature and which are justiciable.

Clause 2: Protection from invasion and domestic violence[edit]

     [...] and [the United States] shall protect each of them [the
     States] against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or
     of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against
     domestic Violence.

   Section Four requires the United States to protect each state from
   invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or
   executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic
   violence. This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot,
   but was not invoked.
