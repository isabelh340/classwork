   The Twenty-fourth Amendment (Amendment XXIV) of the United States
   Constitution prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning
   the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or
   other types of tax. The amendment was proposed by Congress to the
   states on August 27, 1962, and was ratified by the states on January
   23, 1964.

   Poll taxes appeared in southern states after Reconstruction as a
   measure to prevent African Americans from voting, and had been held to
   be constitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in the 1937
   decision Breedlove v. Suttles. At the time of this amendment's passage,
   five states still retained a poll tax: Virginia, Alabama, Texas,
   Arkansas, and Mississippi. The amendment made the poll tax
   unconstitutional in regard to federal elections. However, it was not
   until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 in Harper v. Virginia Board of
   Elections (1966) that poll taxes for state elections were
   unconstitutional because they violated the Equal Protection Clause of
   the Fourteenth Amendment.

   paid to vote)
     No poll tax
   History of the poll tax by state from 1868–1966.

   The poll tax was part of a series of laws intended to marginalize black
   Americans from politics so far as practicable without violating the
   Fifteenth Amendment, which required that voting not be limited by
   "race, color, or previous condition of servitude." The poll tax had the
   additional impact of weakening poor white voters who might sympathize
   with the Populist Party, though this was downplayed by proponents of
   the poll tax for fear of an electoral backlash against them. Passage of
   poll taxes began in earnest in the 1890s, as with the end of
   Reconstruction in 1877, no federal troops remained to enforce black
   voting rights. By 1902, all eleven states of the former Confederacy had
   enacted a poll tax. The poll tax worked in conjunction with a variety
   of disenfranchising measures, such as literacy tests, the "white
   primary", and threats of violence. For example, potential voters had to
   be "assessed" in Arkansas, and blacks were ignored in the
   assessment.^[2]

   The poll tax was largely ignored, at the federal level, from 1900–1937,
   though some state-level initiatives repealed it. The poll tax survived
   a legal challenge in the 1937 Supreme Court case Breedlove v. Suttles,
   which ruled that "[The] privilege of voting is not derived from the
   United States, but is conferred by the state and, save as restrained by
   the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the
   Federal Constitution, the state may condition suffrage as it deems
   appropriate."^[3] The issue remained prominent, as President Franklin
   D. Roosevelt spoke out against the tax. He publicly called it "a
   remnant of the Revolutionary period" that the country had moved past.
   However, Roosevelt's favored liberal Democrats lost in the 1938
   primaries to the reigning conservative Southern Democrats, and he
   backed off, as he felt he needed Southern Democratic votes to pass New
   Deal programs and did not want to further antagonize them.^[4] Still,
   efforts at the Congressional level to abolish the poll tax continued. A
   1939 bill to abolish the poll tax in federal elections was tied up by
   lawmakers from the South, whose long tenure in office gave them
   seniority and a large proportion of committee chairmanships. A
   discharge petition was able to force the bill to be considered, and the
   House passed the bill 254–84.^[5] However, the bill was unable to
   defeat a filibuster in the Senate by Southern senators and a few
   Northern allies who valued the support of the powerful and senior
   Southern seats. This bill would be re-proposed in the next several
   Congresses, coming closest to passage thanks to World War II and the
   ability to frame abolition of the poll tax as a way to help overseas
   soldiers vote. However, senators from the South dug in their heels upon
   news of the Supreme Court decision Smith v. Allwright, which banned the
   "white primary".^[6] The poll tax remained one of the few "legitimate"
   methods of restricting the franchise. The bill came closest to passing
   in 1946. 24 Democrats and 15 Republicans approved an end to debate,
   while 7 non-southern Democrats and 7 Republicans joined with the 19
   Southern Democrats in opposition. The result was a 39-33 vote in favor
   of the bill, but the filibuster required a two-thirds supermajority to
   break at the time; a 48-24 vote was required to pass the
   bill.^[clarification needed] Those in favor of abolition of the poll
   tax considered a constitutional amendment after the 1946 defeat, but
   that idea did not advance either.^[7]

   The tenor of the debate changed in the 1940s. While in the 1890s and
   1900s, politicians had been open about desiring to restrict the black
   vote, by the 1940s Southern politicians attempted to move the debate to
   Constitutional issues. Private correspondence indicates that black
   disenfranchisement was still the true concern, however, and indiscreet
   Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo declared "If the poll tax bill
   passes, the next step will be an effort to remove the registration
   qualification, the educational qualification of Negroes. If that is
   done we will have no way of preventing the Negroes from voting."^[8]
   This fear explains why Southern Senators from states that had abolished
   the poll tax still opposed the bill; they did not want to set a
   precedent that the federal government could interfere in elections.
   President Harry S. Truman established the President's Committee on
   Civil Rights, which among other issues investigated the poll tax.
   Considering that the opposition to federal poll tax regulation in 1948
   was claimed to be a Constitutional one, it noted that a constitutional
   amendment might be the best way to proceed. Still, little occurred
   during the 1950s, as the anti-poll tax movement laid low during the
   anti-Communist mood of the time; some of the main proponents of poll
   tax abolition, such as Joseph Gelders and Vito Marcantonio, had been
   committed Marxists.^[9]

   The Twenty-fourth Amendment, long proposed, was finally sent to the
   states for ratification at the behest of President John F. Kennedy, who
   brought the issue back into public consciousness. Kennedy considered
   the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the
   claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would
   be moot. Still, some liberals opposed Kennedy's action, feeling that an
   amendment would be too slow compared to legislation.^[10] Spessard
   Holland, a conservative Democrat from Florida, introduced the amendment
   to the Senate. Holland opposed most civil rights legislation during his
   career,^[11] and Kennedy's gaining of his support helped splinter
   monolithic Southern opposition to the Amendment. Ratification of the
   amendment took only slightly more than a year, however, as it was
   rapidly ratified by state legislatures across the country from August
   1962 to January 1964. President Johnson called the amendment a "triumph
   of liberty over restriction" and "a verification of people's
   rights."^[12] States that maintained the poll tax were more reserved.
   Mississippi's Attorney General, Joe Patterson, complained about the
   complexity of two sets of voters - those who paid their poll tax and
   could vote in all elections, and those who had not and could only vote
   in federal elections.^[12] Additionally, non-payers of the poll tax
   could still be deterred somewhat by forcing them to register far in
   advance of the election.^[13]

   The official Joint Resolution of Congress proposing what became the
   24th Amendment as contained in the National Archives

   Congress proposed the Twenty-fourth Amendment on August 27,
   1962.^[14]^[15] The amendment was submitted to the states on September
   24, 1962, after it passed with the requisite two-thirds majorities in
   the House and Senate.^[12] The following states ratified the amendment:
    1. Illinois (November 14, 1962)
    2. New Jersey (December 3, 1962)
    3. Oregon (January 25, 1963)

    6. New York (February 4, 1963)
    7. Maryland (February 6, 1963)
    8. California (February 7, 1963)
    9. Alaska (February 11, 1963)

   37. Maine (January 16, 1964)
   38. South Dakota (January 23, 1964)

   Ratification was completed on January 23, 1964. Georgia did make a
   last-second attempt at being the 38th state to ratify – something of a
   surprise as "no Southern help could be expected"^[13] for the amendment
   – but despite the Georgia Senate quickly and unanimously passing it,
   the House did not act in time.^[12] Georgia's ratification was
   apparently dropped after South Dakota's ratification.

   The amendment was subsequently ratified by the following states:
    1. Virginia (February 25, 1977)
    2. North Carolina (May 3, 1989)
    3. Alabama (April 11, 2002)
    4. Texas (May 22, 2009)

   The amendment was specifically rejected by the following state:
    1. Mississippi (December 20, 1962)

   The following states have not ratified the amendment:
    1. Arizona
    2. Arkansas
    3. Georgia
    4. Louisiana
    5. Mississippi
    6. Oklahoma
    7. South Carolina
    8. Wyoming

Post-ratification law[edit]

   Arkansas effectively repealed its poll tax for all elections with
   Amendment 51 to the Arkansas Constitution at the November 1964 general
   election, several months after this amendment was ratified, though the
   poll-tax language was not completely stricken from its Constitution
   until Amendment 85 in 2008.^[16] Of the five states originally affected
   by this amendment, Arkansas was the only one to voluntarily repeal its
   poll tax; the other four retained their taxes until they were struck
   down in 1966 by Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (see below),
   though Federal district courts in Alabama & Texas struck down their
   poll taxes less than two months before Harper.

   The state of Virginia reacted by allowing an "escape clause" to the
   poll tax. In lieu of paying the poll tax, a prospective voter could
   file paperwork to gain a certificate establishing a place of residence
   in Virginia. The papers would have to be filed six months in advance, a
   measure expected to decrease the number of legal voters.^[17] In the
   1965 Supreme Court decision Harman v. Forssenius, the Court unanimously
   found such measures unconstitutional and declared that for federal
   elections, "the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to
   voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed."^[18]

   While not directly related to the Twenty-fourth Amendment, the 1966
   Supreme Court case Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections ruled that the
   poll tax was unconstitutional at every level, not just for federal
   elections. The Harper decision relied upon the Equal Protection Clause
   of the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.
   As such, issues related to whether burdens on voting are equivalent to
   poll taxes have usually been litigated on Equal Protection grounds
   since.

   The 2008 case Crawford v. Marion County Election Board ruled that an
   Indiana law that required voters to obtain and present picture
   identification such as a driver's license was constitutional because
   the Supreme Court found no substantial burden imposed on voters and
   preventing voter fraud was a valid governmental objective
   (identification documents were available from the state at no
   charge).^[citation needed] The lawsuit continued in the 2010 case
   League of Women Voters, et al. v. Todd Rokita where the Indiana Supreme
   Court ruled that requiring photo identification for voting was within
   the legislature's power.^[19]^[20]
