   The Senate Majority and Minority Leaders are two United States Senators
   who are elected by the party caucuses that hold the majority and the
   minority respectively. These leaders serve as the chief Senate
   spokespeople for their parties and manage and schedule the legislative
   and executive business of the Senate. By rule, the Presiding Officer
   gives the Majority Leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on
   the floor of the Senate. The Majority Leader customarily serves as the
   chief representative of his or her party in Senate, and sometimes even
   in all of Congress if the House of Representatives and thus the office
   of Speaker of the House is controlled by the opposition party.

   The Assistant Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate
   (commonly called Senate Majority and Minority Whips) are the
   second-ranking members of the party leadership of the United States
   Senate. The main function of the Majority and Minority Whips is to
   gather votes on major issues. Because he or she is the second ranking
   member of the Senate, if there is no floor leader present, the whip may
   become acting floor leader. Before 1969, the official titles were
   Majority Whip and Minority Whip.

   Many state senates are organized in the same way as the United States
   Senate.

Duties[edit]

   Per 19 U.S.C. § 2191(c)(1), an implementing bill for a fast-track
   negotiating authority (trade promotion authority) trade agreement
   submitted by the President is introduced (by request) in the House by
   the majority leader of the House and (by request) in the Senate by the
   majority leader of the Senate.

Current floor leaders[edit]

   The Senate is currently composed of 53 Democrats, 45 Republicans, and 2
   independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats.

   The current leaders are Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada
   and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The current
   Assistant Majority Leader is Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois. The
   current Assistant Minority Leader is Republican John Cornyn of Texas.

History[edit]

   The Democrats began the practice of electing floor leaders in 1920
   while they were in the minority. John Worth Kern (December 20, 1849 –
   August 17, 1917) was a Democratic United States Senator from Indiana.
   While the title was not official, he is considered to be the first
   Senate party leader (and in turn, the first Senate Democratic Leader),
   while serving concurrently as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
   In 1925 the majority (at the time) Republicans also adopted this
   language when Charles Curtis became the first (official) Majority
   Leader^[citation needed], although his immediate predecessor Henry
   Cabot Lodge is considered the first (unofficial) Senate Majority
   Leader.

   The Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States as
   President of the Senate. The Constitution also calls for a President
   pro tempore to serve as the leader of the body when the President of
   the Senate (the Vice President) is absent. In practice, neither the
   Vice President nor the President pro tempore—customarily the most
   senior (longest-serving) Senator in the majority party—actually
   presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior
   Senators of the majority party, in part so they may learn proper
   procedure. For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who in practice
   manages the Senate.^[citation needed]

List of party leaders[edit]

   The Democratic Party first selected a leader in 1920. The Republican
   Party first formally designated a leader in 1925.

    1. ^ No Republican whips were appointed from 1935 to 1944 since only
       17 Republicans were in the Senate following the landslide
       reelection of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. Accordingly,
       the minutes of the Republican Conference for the period state: "On
       motion of Senator Hastings, duly seconded and carried, it was
       agreed that no Assistant Leader or Whip be elected but that the
       chairman be authorized to appoint Senators from time to time to
       assist him in taking charge of the interests of the minority." A
       note attached to the conference minutes added: "The chairman of the
       conference, Senator McNary, apparently appointed Senator Austin of
       Vermont as assistant leader in 1943 and 1944, until the conference
       adopted Rules of Organization." Source: Party Whips, via Senate.gov
    2. ^ Democrats remained in control after November 25, 2002, despite a
       Republican majority resulting from Jim Talent's special election
       victory in Missouri. There was no reorganization as Senate was no
       longer in session. Party Division in the Senate, 1789-present, via
