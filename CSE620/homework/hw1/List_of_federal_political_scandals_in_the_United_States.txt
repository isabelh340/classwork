Scope and organization of political scandals[edit]

   The article is organized by presidential terms and then divided into
   scandals of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches. Members
   of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at
   the time the scandal took place.

   Scandals; There is no hard and fast rule defining scandals. Scandal is
   defined as "loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or
   apparent violation of morality or propriety." In politics scandal
   should be kept separate from 'controversy,' (which implies two
   differing points of view) and 'unpopularity.' Many decisions are
   controversial, many decisions are unpopular—that alone does not make
   them scandals.

   A good rule of thumb is whether or not an action is, or appears to be,
   illegal. Since everyone, particularly a politician, is expected to be a
   law abiding citizen, breaking the law is, by definition, a scandal.
   Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may
   or may not result in scandals depending on who is bringing the charges,
   the amount of publicity garnered, and the seriousness of the crime, if
   any. The finding of a court with jurisdiction is the sole method used
   to determine a violation of law.

   There is no hard line to distinguish major scandals from minor
   scandals, but rather scandals tend to be defined by the public itself
   and the media's desire to feed that particular frenzy. Thus, small but
   salacious scandals, such as Larry Craig's (Republican from Idaho)
   arrest for lewd behavior can eclipse more serious scandals such as
   suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in time of war.

   What is also not so clear, is how far down the ladder of obscurity a
   scandal should go. During the Truman (D) administration, 196 local IRS
   staffers were found to be corrupt, but they were so far removed from
   Washington, Truman or any of his appointees, that it could hardly be
   called a 'Truman scandal.'

   Also not included in this article are pervasive systemic scandals, such
   as the role of money in normal politics, which purchases access and
   influence. Neither are 'revolving door' stories, which is the practice
   of hiring government officials to promote or lobby for companies they
   were recently paid to regulate. Though some rules now apply, to a great
   extent this is legal in the United States.

   Politicians are those who make their living primarily in politics,
   their staffs and appointees. By definition, political scandals should
   involve politicians and not private citizens. Private citizens should
   be included only when they are closely linked to elected or appointed
   politicians such as party officials. Kenneth Lay of Enron is a good
   example of such a citizen. This list also does not include crimes that
   occur outside the politician's tenure unless they specifically stem
   from acts while they were in office.

   To keep the article a manageable size, Senators and Congressmen who are
   rebuked, admonished, condemned, suspended, found in contempt, found to
   have acted improperly, used poor judgement or were reprimanded by
   Congress are not included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to
   expulsion.

   At the bottom of the article are links to related articles which deal
   with politicians who are actually convicted of crimes, as well as
   differentiating between federal, state and local scandals and two
   separate articles are devoted to sex crimes and scandals.
