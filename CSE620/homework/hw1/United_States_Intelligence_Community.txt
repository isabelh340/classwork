                             Agency overview
        Formed      December 4, 1981
   Agency executive James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence

   The United States Intelligence Community (I.C.) is a federation of 17
   separate United States government agencies that work separately and
   together to conduct intelligence activities considered necessary for
   the conduct of foreign relations and national security of the United
   States. Member organizations of the I.C. include intelligence agencies,
   military intelligence, and civilian intelligence and analysis offices
   within federal executive departments. The I.C. is headed by the
   Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who reports to the President
   of the United States.

   Among their varied responsibilities, the members of the Community
   collect and produce foreign and domestic intelligence, contribute to
   military planning, and perform espionage. The I.C. was established by
   Executive Order 12333, signed on December 4, 1981, by U.S. President
   Ronald Reagan.^[1]

   The Washington Post reported in 2010 that there were 1,271 government
   organizations and 1,931 private companies in 10,000 locations in the
   United States that are working on counterterrorism, homeland security,
   and intelligence, and that the intelligence community as a whole
   includes 854,000 people holding top-secret clearances.^[2] According to
   a 2008 study by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,
   private contractors make up 29% of the workforce in the U.S.
   intelligence community and cost the equivalent of 49% of their
   personnel budgets.^[3]

Etymology[edit]

   The term "Intelligence Community" was first used during Lt. Gen. Walter
   Bedell Smith's tenure as Director of Central Intelligence
   (1950-1953).^[4]

History[edit]

   Intelligence is information that agencies collect, analyze, and
   distribute in response to government leaders’ questions and
   requirements. Intelligence is a broad term that entails:

     Collection, analysis, and production of sensitive information to
     support national security leaders, including policymakers, military
     commanders, and Members of Congress. Safeguarding these processes
     and this information through counterintelligence activities.
     Execution of covert operations approved by the President. The IC
     strives to provide valuable insight on important issues by gathering
     raw intelligence, analyzing that data in context, and producing
     timely and relevant products for customers at all levels of national
     security—from the war-fighter on the ground to the President in
     Washington.^[5]

   Executive Order 12333 charged the IC with six primary objectives:^[6]
     * Collection of information needed by the President, the National
       Security Council, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense,
       and other executive branch officials for the performance of their
       duties and responsibilities;
     * Production and dissemination of intelligence;
     * Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of activities
       to protect against, intelligence activities directed against the
       U.S., international terrorist and/or narcotics activities, and
       other hostile activities directed against the U.S. by foreign
       powers, organizations, persons and their agents;
     * Special activities (defined as activities conducted in support of
       U.S. foreign policy objectives abroad which are planned and
       executed so that the "role of the United States Government is not
       apparent or acknowledged publicly", and functions in support of
       such activities, but which are not intended to influence United
       States political processes, public opinion, policies, or media and
       do not include diplomatic activities or the collection and
       production of intelligence or related support functions);
     * Administrative and support activities within the United States and
       abroad necessary for the performance of authorized activities and
     * Such other intelligence activities as the President may direct from
       time to time.

Programs[edit]

   IC Circle.jpg

   The IC performs under two separate programs:
     * The National Intelligence Program (NIP), formerly known as the
       National Foreign Intelligence Program as defined by the National
       Security Act of 1947 (as amended), "refers to all programs,
       projects, and activities of the intelligence community, as well as
       any other programs of the intelligence community designated jointly
       by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the head of a
       United States department or agency or by the President. Such term
       does not include programs, projects, or activities of the military
       departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and
       conduct of tactical military operations by United States Armed
       Forces". Under the law, the DNI is responsible for directing and
       overseeing the NIP, though the ability to do so is limited (see the
       Organization structure and leadership section).
     * The Military Intelligence Program (MIP) refers to the programs,
       projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire
       intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical
       military operations by United States Armed Forces. The MIP is
       directed and controlled by the Under Secretary of Defense for
       Intelligence. In 2005 the Department of Defense combined the Joint
       Military Intelligence Program and the Tactical Intelligence and
       Related Activities program to form the MIP.

   Since the definitions of the NIP and MIP overlap when they address
   military intelligence, assignment of Department of Defense intelligence
   activities to the NIP and MIP sometimes proves problematic.

Organizational structure and leadership[edit]

   The overall organization of the IC is primarily governed by the
   National Security Act of 1947 (as amended) and Executive Order 12333.
   The statutory organizational relationships were substantially revised
   with the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA)
   amendments to the 1947 National Security Act.

   Though the IC characterizes itself as a federation of its member
   elements, its overall structure is better characterized as a
   confederation due to its lack of a well-defined, unified leadership and
   governance structure. Prior to 2004, the Director of Central
   Intelligence (DCI) was the head of the IC, in addition to being the
   director of the CIA. A major criticism of this arrangement was that the
   DCI had little or no actual authority over the budgetary authorities of
   the other IC agencies and therefore had limited influence over their
   operations.

   Following the passage of IRTPA in 2004, the head of the IC is the
   Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The DNI exerts leadership of
   the IC primarily through statutory authorities under which he or she:
     * controls the "National Intelligence Program" budget;
     * establishes objectives, priorities, and guidance for the IC; and
     * manages and directs the tasking of, collection, analysis,
       production, and dissemination of national intelligence by elements
       of the IC.

   However, the DNI has no authority to direct and control any element of
   the IC except his own staff — the Office of the DNI — neither does the
   DNI have the authority to hire or fire personnel in the IC except those
   on his own staff. The member elements in the executive branch are
   directed and controlled by their respective department heads, all
   cabinet-level officials reporting to the President. By law, only the
   Director of the Central Intelligence Agency reports to the DNI.

   In the light of major intelligence failures in recent years that called
   into the question how well Intelligence Community ensures U.S. national
   security, particularly those identified by the 9/11 Commission
   (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States), and
   the "WMD Commission" (Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of
   the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction), the
   authorities and powers of the DNI and the overall organizational
   structure of the IC have become subject of intense debate in the United
   States.

Interagency cooperation[edit]

   Previously, interagency cooperation and the flow of information among
   the member agencies was hindered by policies that sought to limit the
   pooling of information out of privacy and security concerns. Attempts
   to modernize and facilitate interagency cooperation within the IC
   include technological, structural, procedural, and cultural dimensions.
   Examples include the Intellipedia wiki of encyclopedic security-related
   information; the creation of the Office of the Director of National
   Intelligence, National Intelligence Centers, Program Manager
   Information Sharing Environment, and Information Sharing Council; legal
   and policy frameworks set by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism
   Prevention Act of 2004, information sharing Executive Orders 13354 and
   Executive Order 13388, and the 2005 National Intelligence Strategy.

Budget[edit]

   The U.S. intelligence budget (excluding the Military Intelligence
   Program) in fiscal year 2013 was appropriated as $52.7 billion, and
   reduced by the amount sequestered to $49.0 billion.^[8] In fiscal year
   2012 it peaked at $53.9 billion, according to a disclosure required
   under a recent law implementing recommendations of the 9/11
   Commission.^[9] The 2012 figure was up from $53.1 billion in 2010,^[10]
   $49.8 billion in 2009,^[11] $47.5 billion in 2008,^[12] $43.5 billion
   in 2007,^[13] and $40.9 billion in 2006.^[14]

   About 70 percent of the intelligence budget went to contractors for the
   procurement of technology and services (including analysis), according
   to the May 2007 chart from the ODNI. Intelligence spending has
   increased by a third over ten years ago, in inflation-adjusted dollars,
   according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
   Assessments.^[citation needed].

   In a statement on the release of new declassified figures, DNI Mike
   McConnell said^[when?] there would be no additional disclosures of
   classified budget information beyond the overall spending figure
   because "such disclosures could harm national security". How the money
   is divided among the 17 intelligence agencies and what it is spent on
   is classified. It includes salaries for about 100,000 people,
   multibillion dollar satellite programs, aircraft, weapons, electronic
   sensors, intelligence analysis, spies, computers, and software.

   On August 29, 2013 the Washington Post published the summary of the
   Office of the Director of National Intelligence's multivolume FY 2013
   Congressional Budget Justification, the U.S. intelligence community's
   top-secret "black budget."^[15]^[16]^[17] The IC's FY 2013 budget
   details, how the 17 spy agencies use the money and how it performs
   against the goals set by the president and Congress. Experts said that
   access to such details about U.S. spy programs is without precedent.
   Steven Aftergood, Federation of American Scientists, which provides
   analyses of national security issues stated that “It was a titanic
   struggle just to get the top-line budget number disclosed, and that has
   only been done consistently since 2007,...but a real grasp of the
   structure and operations of the intelligence bureaucracy has been
   totally beyond public reach. This kind of material, even on a
   historical basis, has simply not been available.”^[18] Access to budget
   details will enable an informed public debate on intelligence spending
   for the first time said the co-chair of the 9/11 Commission Lee H.
   Hamilton. He added that Americans should not be excluded from the
   budget process because the intelligence community has a profound impact
   on the life of ordinary Americans.^[18]

Oversight[edit]

   Intelligence Community Oversight duties are distributed to both the
   Executive and Legislative branches. Primary Executive oversight is
   performed by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the
   Joint Intelligence Community Council, the Office of the Inspector
   General, and the Office of Management and Budget. Primary congressional
   oversight jurisdiction over the IC is assigned to two committees: the
   United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the
   United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The House Armed
   Services Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee draft bills to
   annually authorize the budgets of DoD intelligence activities, and both
   the House and Senate appropriations committees annually draft bills to
   appropriate the budgets of the IC. The Senate Committee on Homeland
   Security and Governmental Affairs took a leading role in formulating
   the intelligence reform legislation in the 108th Congress.
