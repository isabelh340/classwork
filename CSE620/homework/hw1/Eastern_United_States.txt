   The area ceded to the United States by Great Britain in 1783 (light
   brown) is usually recognized as the Eastern United States. Louisiana
   and Florida acquisitions were recognized as the Western and Southern
   frontiers in early days of the Republic. Although east of the Rockies,
   Texas is considered Western.

   The Eastern United States or the American East, is today defined by
   some as the states east of the Mississippi River, and is traditionally
   divided by the Ohio River and Appalachian Mountains into the South, the
   Old Northwest and the Northeast. The first two tiers of states west of
   the Mississippi have traditionally been considered part of the West,
   but can be amalgamated with states of the Old Northwest into what the
   Census Bureau defines as the Midwestern United States. It has been
   considered part of the Eastern United States in regional models that
   exclude a Central region. ^[clarification needed]

   As of 2011, the estimated population of the 26 states east of the
   Mississippi (not including the small portions of Minnesota and
   Louisiana that are east of the river) plus Washington, D.C. totals
   179,948,346 out of 308,745,358 in the whole nation (excluding the
   territory of Puerto Rico), or 58.28% of the U.S. population.

Southern United States[edit]

   Main article: Southern United States

   The Southern United States constitutes a large region in the
   south-eastern and south-central United States. Because of the region's
   unique cultural and historic heritage, including Native Americans;
   early European settlements of English, Scots-Irish, Scottish and German
   heritage ; importation of hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans;
   growth of a large proportion of African Americans in the population,
   reliance on slave labor, and legacy of the Confederacy after the
   American Civil War, the South developed its own customs, literature,
   musical styles, and varied cuisines, that have profoundly shaped
   traditional American culture.The South's culture is deeply rooted in
   the American Civil War.

   In the last few decades, the Southern US has been attracting internal
   and international migrants. The American South is among the
   fastest-growing areas in the United States.

   Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina,
   South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Louisiana
   are parts of the Eastern United States which make up the area often
   known as the Southern United States.

New England[edit]

   Main article: New England

   New England is a region of the United States located in the
   northeastern corner of the country, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean,
   Canada and the state of New York, consisting of the modern states of
   Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
   Connecticut.

   In one of the earliest English settlements in the New World, English
   Pilgrims from Europe first settled in New England in 1620, in the
   colony of Plymouth. In the late 18th century, the New England colonies
   would be among the first North American British colonies to demonstrate
   ambitions of independence from the British Crown, although they would
   later threaten secession over the War of 1812 between the United States
   and Britain.

   New England produced the first examples of American literature and
   philosophy and was home to the beginnings of free public education. In
   the 19th century, it played a prominent role in the movement to abolish
   slavery in the United States. It was the first region of the United
   States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution.

   It is a region with one of the highest levels of support for the
   Democratic Party in the United States, with the majority of voters in
   every state voting for the Democrats in the 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008 and
   2012 Presidential elections, and every state but New Hampshire voting
   for Al Gore in 2000.

The Midwest[edit]

   Main article: Midwestern United States

   The Midwestern United States (in the U.S. generally referred to as the
   Midwest) is one of the four geographic regions within the United States
   that are recognized by the United States Census Bureau.

   The region consists of twelve states in the central and inland
   northeastern US: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio,
   and Wisconsin. A 2006 Census Bureau estimate put the population at
   66,217,736. Both the geographic center of the contiguous U.S. and the
   population center of the U.S. are in the Midwest. The United States
   Census Bureau divides this region into the East North Central States
   (essentially the Great Lakes States) and the West North Central States.

   Chicago is the largest city in the region, followed by Indianapolis and
   Columbus. Chicago has the largest metropolitan statistical area,
   followed by Detroit, and Minneapolis – Saint Paul. Sault Ste. Marie,
   Michigan is the oldest city in the region, having been founded by
   French missionaries and explorers in 1668.

   The term Midwest has been in common use for over 100 years. Another
   term sometimes applied to the same general region is "the heartland".
   Other designations for the region have fallen into disuse, such as the
   "Northwest" or "Old Northwest" (from "Northwest Territory") and
   "Mid-America". Since the book Middletown appeared in 1929, sociologists
   have often used Midwestern cities (and the Midwest generally) as
   "typical" of the entire nation. The region has a higher
   employment-to-population ratio (the percentage of employed people at
   least 16 years old) than the Northeast, the West, the South, or the Sun
   Belt states.

   Four of the states associated with the Midwestern United States
   (Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) are traditionally
   referred to as belonging to the Great Plains region. However, in recent
   years they are often included in the Midwestern region.
