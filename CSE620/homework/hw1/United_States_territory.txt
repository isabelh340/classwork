   United States territory is any extent of region under the jurisdiction
   of the federal government of the United States,^[1] including all
   waters (around islands or continental tracts) and all U.S. Naval
   vessels.^[2] The United States has traditionally proclaimed the
   sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing
   its territory.^[3] This extent of territory is all the area belonging
   to, and under the dominion of, the United States federal government
   (which includes tracts lying at a distance from the country) for
   administrative and other purposes.^[1] The United States total
   territory includes a subset of political divisions.

Territory of the United States[edit]

   The United States territory includes any geography under the control of
   the United States federal government. Various regions, districts, and
   divisions are under the supervision of the United States federal
   government. The United States territory includes clearly defined
   geographical area and refers to an area of land, air or sea under
   jurisdiction of United States federal governmental authority (but is
   not limited only to these areas). The extent of territory is all the
   area belonging to, and under the dominion of the United States of
   America federal government (which includes tracts lying at a distance
   from the country) for administrative and other purposes.

Constitution of the United States[edit]

   Original copy of the Constitution.

   Under Article IV of the United States Constitution, territory is
   subject to and belongs to the United States (but not necessarily within
   the national boundaries or any individual state). This includes tracts
   of land or water not included within the limits of any State and not
   admitted as a State into the Union.

   The Constitution of the United States states:

     The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful
     Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property
     belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution
     shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United
     States, or of any particular State.

   —Article IV, United States Constitution

Congress of the United States[edit]

   Congress possesses power to set territorial governments within the
   boundaries of the United States.^[4] The power of Congress over such
   territory is exclusive and universal. Congressional legislation is
   subject to no control, unless in the case of ceded territory. The U.S.
   Congress is granted the exclusive and universal power to set a United
   States territory's political divisions.

Supreme Court of the United States[edit]

   All territory under the control of the federal government is considered
   part of the "United States" for purposes of law.^[5] From 1901–1905,
   the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of opinions known as the Insular
   Cases held that the Constitution extended ex proprio vigore to the
   territories. However, the Court in these cases also established the
   doctrine of territorial incorporation. Under the same, the Constitution
   only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Alaska and
   Hawaii, whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated
   territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.^[6]^[7] A Supreme
   Court ruling from 1945 stated that the term "United States" can have
   three different meanings, in different contexts:

     The term "United States" may be used in any one of several senses.
     It may be merely the name of a sovereign occupying the position
     analogous to that of other sovereigns in the family of nations. It
     may designate the territory over which the sovereignty of the United
     States extends, or it may be the collective name of the states which
     are united by and under the Constitution.

   —Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324 U.S. 652 (1945)

United States Department of the Interior[edit]

   Main article: United States Department of the Interior

   The United States Department of the Interior is charged with managing
   federal affairs within U.S. territory.^[8] The Interior Department has
   a wide range of responsibilities (which include the regulation of
   territorial governments and the basic stewardship for public lands, et
   al.). The United States Department of the Interior is not responsible
   for local government or for civil administration except in the cases of
   Indian reservations, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as
   those territories administered through the Office of Insular Affairs.

United States divisions[edit]

   Main article: Political divisions of the United States

District, states, counties, cities, and townships[edit]

   2010 U.S. population density in persons per sq. mile. This map shows
   states and counties.

   Territories are subdivided into legally administered tracts—e.g.,
   geographic areas that are under the authority of a government.^[9] For
   example, American Samoa is a territory of the government of the United
   States. The U.S. states created the federal government and the U.S.
   Constitution and comprise the sovereign United States. The United
   States, rather than individual states, conducts foreign relations under
   the U.S. Constitution. The District of Columbia is under the direct
   authority of Congress,^[10] and was established from territory ceded by
   the states of Maryland and Virginia, with all of the Virginia cession
   having since been returned to that state.^[citation needed]

   The contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Alaska are divided into
   smaller administrative regions. These are called counties in 48 of the
   50 states, and they are called boroughs in Alaska and parishes in
   Louisiana. A county can include a number of cities and towns, or just a
   portion of either type. These counties have varying degrees of
   political and legal significance. A township in the United States
   refers to a small geographic area. The term is used in two ways: a
   survey township is simply a geographic reference used to define
   property location for deeds and grants; a civil township is a unit of
   local government, originally rural in application.

   Federal enclaves, such as domestic military bases and national parks,
   are administered directly by the federal government. To varying
   degrees, the federal government exercises concurrent jurisdiction with
   the states where federal land is part of the territory previously
   granted to a state.

History of United States territory[edit]

   Main articles: Historic regions of the United States, United States
   territorial acquisitions and Territorial evolution of the United States

   At times, territories are organized with a separate legislature, under
   a territorial governor and officers, appointed by the President and
   approved by the Senate of the United States. A territory has been
   historically divided into organized territories and unorganized
   territories.^[11]^[12] An unorganized territory was generally either
   unpopulated or set aside for Native Americans and other indigenous
   peoples in the United States by the U.S. federal government, until such
   time as the growing and restless population encroached into the areas.
   In recent times, "unorganized" refers to the degree of
   self-governmental authority exercised by the territory.

   As a result of several Supreme Court cases after the Spanish-American
   War, the United States had to determine how to deal with its newly
   acquired territories, such as the Philippines,^[13]^[14] Puerto
   Rico,^[15] Guam,^[16]^[17] Wake Island, and other areas that were not
   part of the North American continent and which were not necessarily
   intended to become a part of the Union of States. As a consequence of
   the Supreme Court decisions, the United States has since made a
   distinction between incorporated and unincorporated
   territories.^[18]^[19]^[20] In essence, an incorporated territory is
   land that has been irrevocably incorporated within the sovereignty of
   the United States and to which the full corpus of the U.S. Constitution
   applies. An unincorporated territory is land held by the United States,
   and to which Congress of the United States applies selected parts of
   the constitution. At the present time, the only incorporated U.S.
   territory is the unorganized (and unpopulated) Palmyra Atoll.

Insular areas[edit]

   Main articles: Insular area and Territories of the United States
   Map of the U.S. Insular areas.

   The United States currently administers 16 territories as insular
   areas:
     * American Samoa
     * Guam
     * Northern Mariana Islands
     * Puerto Rico
     * U.S. Virgin Islands

                                 * Minor Outlying Islands
                                      + Bajo Nuevo Bank
                                      + Baker Island
                                      + Howland Island
                                      + Jarvis Island
                                      + Johnston Atoll
                                      + Kingman Reef
                                      + Midway Islands
                                      + Navassa Island
                                      + Palmyra Atoll
                                      + Serranilla Bank
                                      + Wake Island

   Palmyra Atoll is the only incorporated territory remaining, and having
   no government it is also unorganized. The remaining are unincorporated
   territories of the United States. Puerto Rico and Northern Mariana
   Islands are styled as commonwealths.

Dependent areas[edit]

   Main article: Insular area

   Several islands in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea are dependent
   territories of the United States.^[21]^[22]

   The Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is administered by
   the United States under a perpetual lease, much as the Panama Canal
   Zone used to be before the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and
   only mutual agreement or U.S. abandonment of the area can terminate the
   lease.

   From July 18, 1947, until October 1, 1994, the United States
   administered the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, but the Trust
   ceased to exist when the last member state of Palau gained its
   independence to become the Republic of Palau. The Panama canal, and the
   Canal Zone surrounding it, was territory administered by the United
   States until 1999, when control was relinquished to Panama.

   The United States has made no territorial claim in Antarctica but has
   reserved the right to do so.

Maritime territory of the United States[edit]

   The government of the United States of America has claims to the oceans
   in accord with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
   which delineates a zone of territory adjacent to territorial lands and
   seas. United States protects this marine environment, though not
   interfering with other lawful uses of this zone. The United States
   jurisdiction has been established on vessels, ships, and artificial
   islands (along with other marine structures).

   In 1983 President Ronald Reagan, through Proclamation No. 5030, claimed
   a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. In December 1988 President Reagan,
   through Proclamation No. 5928, extended U.S. territorial waters from
   three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles for national security
   purposes. However a legal opinion from the Justice Department
   questioned the President's constitutional authority to extend
   sovereignty as Congress has the power to make laws concerning the
   territory belonging to the United States under the U.S. Constitution.
   In any event, Congress needs to make laws defining if the extended
   waters, including oil and mineral rights, are under State or Federal
   control.^[23]^[24]

   The primary enforcer of maritime law is the U.S. Coast Guard. Federal
   and state governments share economic and regulatory jurisdiction over
   the waters owned by the country. (See tidelands.)

International law[edit]

   The United States is not restricted from making laws governing its own
   territory by international law. The United States territory can include
   occupied territory, which is a geographic area that claims sovereignty,
   but is being forcibly subjugated to the authority of the United States
   of America. United States territory can also include disputed
   territory, which is a geographic area claimed by United States of
   America and one (or more) rival governments.

   Like most nations, the United States of America has acquired territory
   by force and conquest (Latin, "to seek for"). Internationally
   (specifically according to the Hague conventions), United States
   territory can include areas occupied by and controlled by a United
   States army. When de facto military control is maintained and
   exercised, occupation (and thus possession) extends to that territory.
   By convention, the forces in control of the territory have a
   responsibility to provide for the basic needs of individuals under
   their control (which includes food, clothing, shelter, medical
   attention, law maintenance, and social order). To prevent systematic
   abuse of puppet governments by the occupation forces, they must enforce
   laws that were in place in the territory prior to the occupation.

Customs territories[edit]

   The fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico form the
   main customs territory of the United States. Special rules apply to
   foreign trade zones in these areas. Separate customs territories are
   formed by American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S.
   Minor Outlying Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Other areas[edit]

   U.S. sovereignty includes the airspace over its land and territorial
   waters. No international agreement exists on the vertical limit that
   separates this from outer space, which is international.

   Federal jurisdiction includes federal enclaves like national parks and
   domestic military bases, even though these are located in the territory
   of a state. Host states exercise concurrent jurisdiction to some
   degree.

   The United States exercises extraterritoriality on overseas embassies
   and military bases, including the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.
   Despite exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction, these overseas
   locations remain under the sovereignty of the host countries.

   The federal government also exercises property ownership, but not
   sovereignty over land in various foreign countries. Examples include
   the John F. Kennedy Memorial built at Runnymede in England,^[25] and 13
   hectares around Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France.^[26]
