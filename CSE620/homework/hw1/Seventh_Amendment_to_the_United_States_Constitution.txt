   The Seventh Amendment (Amendment VII) to the United States Constitution
   is part of the Bill of Rights. This amendment codifies the right to a
   jury trial in certain civil cases, and inhibits courts from overturning
   a jury's findings of fact.

   An early version of the Seventh Amendment was introduced in Congress in
   1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments to the Bill of
   Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new
   Constitution. Congress proposed a revised version of the Seventh
   Amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15,
   1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it.
   Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the
   amendment on March 1, 1792.

   The Seventh Amendment is generally considered one of the more
   straightforward amendments of the Bill of Rights. Unlike most of the
   Bill's provisions, the Seventh Amendment has never been incorporated
   (i.e., applied to the states), although almost every state voluntarily
   complies with such a requirement. United States v. Wonson (1812)
   established the "historical test", which interpreted the amendment as
   relying on English common law to determine whether a jury trial was
   necessary in a civil suit. The amendment thus does not guarantee trial
   by jury in cases under maritime law, in lawsuits against the government
   itself, and for many parts of patent claims. In all other cases, the
   jury can be waived by consent of the parties.

   The amendment additionally guarantees a minimum of six members for a
   jury in a civil trial. The amendment's twenty dollar threshold has not
   been the subject of much scholarly or judicial writing; that threshold
   remains applicable despite the inflation that has occurred since the
   18th century.

Text[edit]

     In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed
     twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and
     no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court
     of the United States, than according to the rules of the common
     law.^[1]

   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives

Background[edit]

   After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles
   of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed
   a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief
   executive and other changes.^[2] George Mason, a Constitutional
   Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of
   Rights, proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil
   liberties be included. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights
   drafter James Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees
   of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate
   individual rights risked implying that the federal government had power
   to violate every other right (this concern eventually led to the Ninth
   and Tenth Amendments). After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was
   defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.^[3] In the final
   days of the convention, North Carolina delegate Hugh Williamson
   proposed a guarantee of trial by jury in federal civil cases, but a
   motion to add this guarantee was also defeated.^[4]

   However, for the Constitution to be adopted, nine of the thirteen
   states were required to ratify it in state conventions. Opposition to
   ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's
   lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the
   Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification
   (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed
   that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for
   the addition of a bill of rights.^[5]

   One charge of the Anti-Federalists was that giving the U.S. Supreme
   Court jurisdiction "both as to law and fact" would allow it to deny the
   findings of jury trials in civil cases. Responding to these concerns,
   five state ratification conventions recommended guaranteeing the right
   to jury trial in civil cases by constitutional amendment.^[6]

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   Main article: United States Bill of Rights
   James Madison, drafter of the Bill of Rights

   In the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures'
   request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based
   on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights
   1689.^[7] Among them was an amendment protecting findings of fact in
   civil cases exceeding a certain dollar value from judicial review.
   Madison proposed that this amendment be added directly to Article
   Three, though Congress later determined to add the proposed Bill of
   Rights to the end of the Constitution, leaving the original text
   intact.^[6] Congress also reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments
   to twelve, and these were proposed to the states for ratification on
   September 25, 1789.^[8]^[9]

   By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for
   ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists,
   who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as
   a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism.
   Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the
   Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second
   constitutional convention, which they desired.^[10] Anti-Federalists
   such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most
   objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal
   judiciary and direct taxation, intact.^[11]

   On November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve
   amendments, rejecting an amendment to regulate congressional pay
   raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North
   Carolina ratified all twelve amendments.^[12] On January 19, 25, and
   28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware
   ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on
   Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected Article I, which
   regulated the size of the House.^[12] This brought the total of
   ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in
   other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights
   unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most
   of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary
   of State that it had done so.^[11]^[a]

   In February through June of 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode
   Island ratified eleven of the amendments, though all three rejected the
   amendment on Congressional pay raises. Virginia initially postponed its
   debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total
   number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont
   ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and
   Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791.^[11] Secretary of State
   Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully
   ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.^[13]

Judicial interpretation[edit]

   The Seventh Amendment is generally considered one of the more
   straightforward amendments of the Bill of Rights. Scholar Charles W.
   Wolfram states that it has usually "been interpreted as if it were
   virtually a self-explanatory provision".^[14]^[15]

   Unlike most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, the Seventh
   Amendment has never been applied to the states. The Supreme Court
   stated in Walker v. Sauvinet (1875), Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad
   v. Bombolis (1916) and Hardware Dealers' Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of
   Wisconsin v. Glidden Co. (1931) that states were not required to
   provide jury trials in civil cases.^[15] Nonetheless, most states
   voluntarily guarantee the right to a civil jury trial,^[16] and they
   must do so in certain state court cases that are decided under federal
   law.^[17]

The historical test[edit]

   Justice Joseph Story issued the first judicial opinion on the amendment
   in United States v. Wonson (1812).^[18]

   The first judicial opinion issued on the amendment came in United
   States v. Wonson (1812), in which the federal government wished to
   retry the facts of a civil case it had lost against Samuel Wonson.^[18]
   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, acting as a circuit court judge,
   ruled for Wonson, stating that to retry the facts of the case would
   violate the Seventh Amendment. Regarding the amendment's phrase "the
   rules of common law", Story wrote:

     Beyond all question, the common law here alluded to is not the
     common law of any individual state, (for it probably differs in
     all), but it is the common law of England, the grand reservoir of
     all our jurisprudence. It cannot be necessary for me to expound the
     grounds of this opinion, because they must be obvious to every
     person acquainted with the history of the law.^[19]

   Wonson's ruling established the "historical test", which interpreted
   the amendment as relying on English common law to determine whether a
   jury trial was necessary in a civil suit. Applying the historical test
   in Parsons v. Bedford (1830), for example, the Supreme Court found that
   jury trials were not constitutionally guaranteed for cases under
   maritime law, an area in which English common law did not require
   juries. The Court further clarified this rule as a "fixed historical
   test" in Thompson v. Utah (1898), which established that the relevant
   guide was English common law of 1791, rather than that of the present
   day.^[15] In Chauffeurs, Teamsters, and Helpers Local No. 391 v. Terry
   (1990), the Court explained that the right to a jury trial provided by
   the Seventh Amendment encompasses more than the common law forms of
   action recognized in 1791 (when the Bill of Rights was ratified), but
   rather any lawsuit in which parties’ legal rights were to be
   determined, as opposed to suits which only involve equitable rights and
   remedies.^[20]

   In Galloway v. United States (1943), the Court permitted a directed
   verdict (a verdict ordered by a judge on the basis of overwhelming lack
   of evidence) in a civil suit, finding that it did not violate the
   Seventh Amendment under the fixed historical test.^[15] The Court
   extended the amendment's guarantees in Beacon Theatres v. Westover
   (1959) and Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood (1962), ruling in each case that
   all issues that required trial by jury under English common law also
   required trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment.^[6] This guarantee
   was also further extended to shareholder suits in Ross v. Bernhard
   (1970)^[6] and to copyright infringement lawsuits in Feltner v.
   Columbia Pictures TV (1998).^[15]

   In Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. (1996), the Court ruled that
   many parts of patent claims are questions of law rather than of fact,
   and that the Seventh Amendment guarantee of a jury trial therefore does
   not necessarily apply. Lawsuits against the federal government itself
   do not receive Seventh Amendment protections due to the doctrine of
   sovereign immunity. In Lehman v. Nakshian (1981), the Court ruled that
   citizens may sue the federal government only in cases where such right
   has been granted by act of Congress.^[15]

Jury size[edit]

   The Supreme Court has held that the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a
   jury trial also guarantees a jury of sufficient size. While the Court
   found a six-member jury sufficient to meet the amendment's requirements
   in Colgrove v. Battin (1973), it ruled in Ballew v. Georgia (1978) that
   a five-member jury violated the amendment's intent.^[21] Regardless of
   size, the jury's verdict must be unanimous.^[4]

Twenty Dollars Clause[edit]

   Little historical evidence exists to interpret the Twenty Dollars
   Clause, which was added in a closed session of the Senate, and is often
   omitted in judicial and scholarly discussion of the amendment. A
   Harvard Law Review article described it as "mysterious ... of shrouded
   origin and neglected for two centuries", stating that "no one believes
   that the Clause bears on the right protected by the Seventh
   Amendment."^[22] According to law professor Philip Hamburger, this
   clause was intended to become obsolete by inflation, so that its
   application to more cases would be phased in gradually.^[23]

   Congress has never extended federal diversity jurisdiction to amounts
   that small. Under the current Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28
   U.S.C. §1332), the amount in dispute in diversity cases (which involve
   parties from different states) must exceed $75,000 in order for the
   case to be heard in federal court.^[24] However, civil cases may arise
   in federal court that are not diversity cases (e.g. in places like the
   District of Columbia that are federal jurisdictions), in which case the
   Twenty Dollars Clause may apply.^[25]
