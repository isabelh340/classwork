   The national flag of the United States of America, often referred to as
   the American flag, consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red
   (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the
   canton (referred to specifically as the "union") bearing fifty small,
   white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of
   six stars (top and bottom) alternating with rows of five stars. The 50
   stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of
   America and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that
   declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and became the
   first states in the Union.^[1] Nicknames for the flag include the
   "Stars and Stripes", "Old Glory",^[2] and "The Star-Spangled Banner".

History[edit]

   See also: Timeline of the flag of the United States

   The design of the flag has been modified 26 times officially since
   1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star
   version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered
   by President Eisenhower on August 21, 1959.^[3]

First flag[edit]

     * FIAV historical.svg The Continental Colors
       (aka Grand Union Flag)
     * FIAV historical.svg Flag of the British East India Company,
       1707–1801

   At the time of the Declaration of Independence, the Continental
   Congress would not legally adopt flags with "stars, white in a blue
   field" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as "the
   Continental Colors" has historically been referred to as the first
   national flag.^[4]

   The Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling
   nation in the American War for Independence—likely with the expedient
   of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white
   stripes—and would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the
   basis for the subsequent de jure designs.^[4]^[5]

   The name "Grand Union" was first applied to the Continental Colors by
   George Preble in his 1872 history of the American flag.^[5]

   The flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the
   era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the Company flag
   inspired the design.^[6] Both flags could have been easily constructed
   by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, the maritime flag used
   throughout the British Empire. However, an East India Company flag
   could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown
   outside the Indian Ocean.^[7]

   In any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have
   precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in
   early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing
   territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of
   arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.

   The first American flags were made out of hemp.^[8]

The Flag Resolution of 1777[edit]

   On June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag
   Resolution which stated: "Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen
   United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the
   union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new
   constellation."^[9] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year.
   While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new
   flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the
   Middlebrook encampment.^[10]

   The first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777
   at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix.
   Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress
   of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to
   make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured
   from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the
   blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat.
   A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by
   Congress for his coat for the flag.^[11]

   arranged in rows.
   FIAV historical.svg 13-star "Betsy Ross" variant

   The 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign.
   In the late 18th century, the notion of national flag did not yet
   exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other
   resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of
   the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern "it is not yet
   settled what is the Standard of the United States."^[12]

   The Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number
   of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement and
   appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged
   the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a
   state's star with its initial.^[13] One famous arrangement features 13
   outwardly-oriented five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, the
   so-called Betsy Ross flag. Although the Betsy Ross legend is
   controversial, the design is among the earliest 13-star flags. Popular
   designs at the time were varied and most were individually crafted
   rather than mass-produced. Examples of 13-star arrangements can be
   found on other flags attributed to Francis Hopkinson, the Cowpens flag,
   and the Brandywine flag.

   Despite the 1777 resolution, a number of flags only loosely based on
   the prescribed design were used in the early years of American
   independence. One example may have been the Guilford Court House Flag,
   traditionally believed to have been carried by the American troops at
   the Battle of Guilford Court House in 1781. Other evidence suggests it
   dates only to the nineteenth century.^[14] The original flag is at the
   North Carolina Historical Museum.

   The origin of the stars and stripes design is inadequately documented.
   The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from
   a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for
   this exists; indeed, nearly a century had passed before Ross' grandson,
   William Canby, first publicly suggested it.^[15] Another woman, Rebecca
   Young, has also been credited as having made the first flag by later
   generations of her family. Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who
   made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.^[16]^[17] According to rumor, the
   Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby
   Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.^[18]

   Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a signer of the Declaration of
   Independence, designed the 1777 flag^[19] while he was the Chairman of
   the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his
   appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the
   flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. Hopkinson was the only person
   to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a bill
   to Congress for his work. He asked for a "Quarter Cask of the Public
   Wine" as payment initially. The payment was not made, however, because
   it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of
   Congress.^[20] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag,
   which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by
   request of the government in the Spring of 1776.^[21]^[22]

Later flag acts[edit]

   FIAV historical.svg 15-star, 15-stripe Star Spangled Banner Flag
   FIAV historical.svg The 48-star flag was in use 1912–1959, second
   longest only to the current one.
   See also: Flag Acts (U.S.)

   In 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15
   (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union).
   For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were
   admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too
   much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis
   Scott Key to write "Defence of Fort M'Henry", later known as "The Star
   Spangled Banner", which is now the American national anthem. The flag
   is currently on display in the exhibition, "The Star-Spangled Banner:
   The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem" at the Smithsonian
   Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display
   chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.^[23]

   On April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of
   U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid^[24] in which the flag was changed to
   have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was
   admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to
   honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs
   should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following
   admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49
   stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after
   Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of
   Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star
   flag.^[25]

   Prior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no
   official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army
   and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century
   there were a plethora of star patterns, rectangular and circular.

   On July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in
   longest use.

The "Flower Flag" arrives in Asia[edit]

   The U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (Guǎngzhōu) in China in
   1785 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of
   ginseng.^[26] There it gained the designation "Flower Flag" (Chinese:
   花旗; pinyin: huāqí; Cantonese Yale: fākeì).^[27] According to a
   pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later
   retold by author and U.S. Naval officer George H. Preble:

     When the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much
     curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a
     strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing
     a flag "as beautiful as a flower." Every body went to see the kwa
     kee chuen [花旗船; Fākeìsyùhn], or "flower flag ship." This name at
     once established itself in the language, and America is now called
     the kwa kee kwoh [花旗國; Fākeìgwok], the "flower flag country"—and an
     American, kwa kee kwoh yin [花旗國人; Fākeìgwokyàhn]—"flower flag
     countryman"—a more complimentary designation than that of "red
     headed barbarian"—the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.^[28]^[29]

   In the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on
   spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries.^[30] Other Asian nations have equivalent
   terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa Kỳ ("Flower Flag").
   Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: 美国;
   traditional Chinese: 美國; pinyin: Měiguó. Měi is short for Měilìjiān (a
   Chinese pronunciation of "America") and "guó" means "country", so this
   name is unrelated to the flag. However, the "flower flag" terminology
   persists in some places today; for example, American Ginseng is called
   simplified Chinese: 花旗参; traditional Chinese: 花旗參; literally: "flower
   flag ginseng" in Chinese.

   The U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787–90 on board
   the Columbia.^[27] William Driver, who coined the phrase "Old Glory",
   took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831–32.^[27] The flag attracted
   the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to
   Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world
   journey in 1871.^[31]

   In the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United
   States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual
   patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs,
   prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official
   arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag
   were not standardized until 1934.^[32]

Symbolism[edit]

   Astronaut Buzz Aldrin salutes the United States flag on the surface of
   the moon during the Apollo 11 mission.
   U.S. flag on Mars (Curiosity Rover, September 19, 2012).

   The modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major
   Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort
   Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening
   move of the Civil War, and the flag was used throughout the North to
   symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism.

     Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or
     a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts,
     embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like
     American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's
     surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars
     and Stripes flew—as it does today, and especially as it did after
     the September 11 attacks in 2001—from houses, from storefronts, from
     churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first
     time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually
     stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand.
     As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant
     something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured
     into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would
     fight for, and many thousands die for.

   —Adam Goodheart, Prologue of 1861: The Civil War Awakening (2011).

   The flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely
   recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently
   displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The
   flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing
   ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag
   has been used in public discourse to refer to the United
   States.^[citation needed]

   The flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is proudly
   flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail
   outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a
   public outrage, but remains protected as freedom of speech. In
   worldwide comparison, Testi (2010) notes that the United States is not
   unique in adoring its banner, for in Scandinavian countries their flags
   are also "beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized
   objects".^[34]

Design[edit]

Creation[edit]

   The man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag is
   Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag
   design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his
   grandparents in Ohio.^[35]

Specifications[edit]

   Diagram of the flag's design

   The basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C. § 1; 4
   U.S.C. § 2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states.
   The specification gives the following values:
     * Hoist (height) of the flag: A = 1.0
     * Fly (width) of the flag: B = 1.9^[36]
     * Hoist (height) of the canton ("union"): C = 0.5385 (A × 7/13,
       spanning seven stripes)
     * Fly (width) of the canton: D = 0.76 (B × 2/5, two-fifths of the
       flag width)
     * E = F = 0.0538 (C/10, One-tenth of the height of the canton)
     * G = H = 0.0633 (D/12, One twelfth of the width of the canton)
     * Diameter of star: K = 0.0616 (L × 4/5, four-fifths of the stripe
       width, the calculation only gives 0.0616 if L is first rounded to
       0.077)
     * Width of stripe: L = 0.0769 (A/13, One thirteenth of the flag
       height)

   These specifications are contained in an executive order which,
   strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal
   government.^[37] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for
   sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes
   are 2 × 3 ft. or 4 × 6 ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 × 4 ft. or 5 × 8 ft.
   (1.6), or 3 × 5 ft. or 6 × 10 ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the
   U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators
   are provided in these sizes.^[38] Flags that are made to the prescribed
   1.9 ratio are often referred to as "G-spec" (for "government
   specification") flags.

Colors[edit]

   The exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are
   specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of
   America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are "White", "Old Glory
   Red", and "Old Glory Blue".^[39] The CIE coordinates for the colors of
   the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in
   JOSA in 1946.^[40] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there
   is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK
   for printing. The "relative" coordinates in the following table were
   found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag’s
   "white".

   A subdued-color flag patch, similar to style worn on the United States
   Army's ACU uniform. The patch is normally worn reversed on the right
   upper sleeve. See explanation in "Display on uniforms" section below.

   As with the design, the official colors are only officially required
   for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors
   are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other
   products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more
   saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche,
   and Granville wrote in 1950: "The color of the official wool bunting
   [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of
   the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present
   the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool."^[42]

   Sometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag
   colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy
   in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in
   Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and
   that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A
   third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in
   2002.^[43] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of
   the Texas flag should be "(1) the same colors used in the United States
   flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the
   Pantone Matching System."^[44]

The 49- and 50-star unions[edit]

   A U.S. flag with gold fringe and a gold eagle on top of the flag pole.

   When Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the
   1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D.
   Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast
   majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were
   identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.^[46] At the time,
   credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army
   Institute of Heraldry for the design.

   Of these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958
   as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a
   seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally
   received a B– for the project. After discussing the grade with his
   teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was
   accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag
   design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska
   and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.^[47] According
   to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade
   to an A for the project.^[48] Both the 49- and 50-star flags were each
   flown for the first time ever at Fort McHenry on Independence Day one
   year apart, 1959 and 1960 respectively.^[48]

Decoration[edit]

   Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding
   the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag
   proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on
   indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag.

   The first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the
   Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality
   of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use
   of fringe (and the number of stars) "... is at the discretion of the
   Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy ..." as quoted from footnote in
   previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is
   a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian.
   However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has
   official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered,
   there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.^[49]
   Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,^[50]^[51] most
   recently and forcefully in Colorado v Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals
   judgment that was released in May 2010.^[52] Traditionally, the Army
   and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and
   indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast
   Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all uses.

Display and use[edit]

   Concert in Washington, D.C.

   The flag is customarily flown all year-round at most public buildings,
   and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5
   feet (0.91 by 1.52 m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but
   becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day,
   Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it
   is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves
   of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag
   at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives
   fighting in U.S. wars.

Flag etiquette[edit]

   Main article: United States Flag Code
   Proper stationary vertical display (the blue field of stars (canton)
   should always be in the upper left)

   The United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use,
   display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never
   be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to
   a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from
   the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip
   their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team
   captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying "this flag dips to
   no earthly king", though the true provenance of this quotation is
   unclear.^[53]^[54]
   A tattered flag at Spokane Valley Police Headquarters, Spokane,
   Washington

   The flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at
   night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear,
   the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered
   that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should
   be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American
   Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement
   ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America
   recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of
   burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are
   burned.)^[55]

   The Flag Code prohibits using the flag "for any advertising purpose"
   and also states that the flag "should not be embroidered, printed, or
   otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs,
   napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary
   use".^[56] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always
   without comment.

   Section 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: "The flag should
   never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery", and "No part of
   the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform". Section
   3 of the Flag Code^[57] defines "the flag" as anything "by which the
   average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the
   same to represent the flag of the United States of America".

   An additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently
   violated at sporting events is part (c) "The flag should never be
   carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free."

   Although the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a
   private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is
   not widely enforced—indeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with
   the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.^[58] Passage of the
   proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that
   has been established.

Display on vehicles[edit]

   When the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind
   (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, anything that moves), it should be oriented
   so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag
   were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward.
   Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear
   to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left
   as more commonly seen.

   The flag has been displayed on every US spacecraft designed for manned
   flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module,
   Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on
   the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo.
   But since Mercury, Gemini and Apollo were launched and landed
   vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight like
   an airplane, the "streaming" convention was not followed and these
   flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally,
   perpendicular to the direction of flight.

Display on uniforms[edit]

   The crew of Apollo 1 wore their flags on the right shoulder, unlike all
   other US astronaut flight crews
   Flag of the United States on American astronaut Neil Armstrong's space
   suit

   On some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right
   shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the
   front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both
   mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer,
   who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion
   caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted
   with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right,
   while the stripes flew to the left.^[59] Several US military uniforms,
   such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Navy, have
   the flag patch on the left shoulder.^[60]

   Other organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have
   the flag facing in either direction. The uniform of the Boy Scouts of
   America, for example, has the stripes facing front, the reverse of the
   military style. Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch,
   either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.

   Every US astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the
   left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew
   of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case,
   the canton was on the left.

Postage stamps[edit]

   Flags depicted on U.S. postage stamp issues

   The flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of
   White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a
   circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General
   Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction.
   The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject
   was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.^[61] Since that
   time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.

Display in museums[edit]

   Flag displayed at the Flint Hills Discovery Center in Manhattan, Kansas

   In 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant
   Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814
   bombardment) lent the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian
   Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton
   donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the
   public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined
   that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation
   treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum
   conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from
   its home in the Museum’s Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory.
   Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on
   November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition,
   "The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,"
   where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation
   purposes.^[23]

Places of continuous display[edit]

   By presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags
   are displayed continuously at certain locations.
     * Replicas of the Star Spangled Banner Flag (15 stars, 15 stripes)
       are flown at two sites in Baltimore, Maryland: Fort McHenry
       National Monument and Historic Shrine^[62] and Flag House
       Square.^[63]
     * Marine Corps War Memorial (Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima),

       the signatory countries of the original Antarctic Treaty.
     * On the Moon: six manned missions successfully landed at various
       location and each had a flag raised at the site. The flag placed by
       the Apollo 11 mission was blown over by exhaust gases when the
       Ascent Stage launched to return the astronauts to their Command
       Module for return to Earth.^[75]

   The flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following
   days:
     * January: 1 (New Year's Day), 3rd Monday of the month (Martin Luther
       King, Jr. Day, which occasionally falls on King's birthday on the
       15th, and which sometimes falls on the birthday of Robert E. Lee on
       the 19th) and 20 (Inauguration Day, once every four years, which,
       by tradition, is postponed to the 21st if the 20th falls on a
       Sunday)
     * February: 12 (Lincoln's birthday) and the third Monday (legally
       known as Washington's Birthday but more often called Presidents'
       Day; originally Washington's birthday which is the 22nd)
     * May: Third Saturday (Armed Forces Day) and last Monday (Memorial
       Day; half-staff until noon)
     * June: 14 (Flag Day)
     * July: 4 (Independence Day) and 27 (National Korean War Veterans
       Armistice Day)^[76]
     * September: First Monday (Labor Day), 17th (Constitution Day)
     * October: Second Monday (Columbus Day) and 27 (Navy Day)
     * November: 11 (Veterans Day) and fourth Thursday (Thanksgiving Day)
     * and such other days as may be proclaimed by the President of the
       United States; the birthdays of states (date of admission); and on
       state holidays.^[77]

Display at half-staff[edit]

   An American flag now flies over Gate 17 of Terminal A at Newark Liberty
   International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, departure gate of United
   Airlines Flight 93 on 9/11.

   The flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a
   sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by
   the president; state-wide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made
   by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal
   governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at
   half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag
   enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the
   meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who
   held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D.
   Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954,
   standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at
   half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels;
   other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued.
   However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically
   followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of
   private businesses and citizens.

   To properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist
   it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway
   between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to
   be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the
   top of the staff.^[78]

   Federal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on
   the following dates:
     * May 15: Peace Officers Memorial Day (unless it is the third
       Saturday in May, Armed Forces Day, then full-staff)^[79]
     * Last Monday in May: Memorial Day (until noon)
     * September 11: Patriot Day^[80]
     * First Sunday in October: Start of Fire Prevention Week, in honor of
       the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.^[81]^[82]
     * December 7: National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day^[83]
     * For 30 days: Death of a president or former president
     * For 10 days: Death of a vice president, Supreme Court chief
       justice/retired chief justice, or speaker of the House of
       Representatives.
     * From death until the day of interment: Supreme Court associate
       justice, member of the Cabinet, former vice president, president
       pro tempore of the Senate, or the majority and minority leaders of
       the Senate and House of Representatives. Also for federal
       facilities within a state or territory, for the governor.
     * On the day after the death: Senators, members of Congress,
       territorial delegates or the resident commissioner of the
       commonwealth of Puerto Rico

   Further, the flag is always flown at half-staff at four locations in
   the United States. These locations are The Tomb of the Unknowns at
   Arlington National Cemetery; Arlington House at Arlington National
   Cemetery; the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, and Mackinac
   Island, Michigan (Fort Mackinac Post Cemetery).^[84]

   National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a
   day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. Upon its
   re-enactment in 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.
   ^[76]^[85]

Folding for storage[edit]

   Folding the U.S. flag

   Though not part of the official Flag Code, according to military
   custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use.
   To properly fold the flag:
    1. Begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its
       surface is parallel to the ground.
    2. Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field
       of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.
    3. Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.
    4. Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the
       striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the
       flag, starting the fold from the left side over to the right.
    5. Turn the outer end point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form
       a second triangle.
    6. The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the
       flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds,
       as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not
       neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds,
       the last triangle) is tucked into the previous fold.
    7. When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of
       stars should be visible.

   There is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However,
   there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the
   Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts
   range from historical timelines of the flag to religious
   themes.^[86]^[87]^[88]

Use in funerals[edit]

   A flag prepared for presentation to the next of kin

   Traditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military
   funerals,^[89] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants
   (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents).
   A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during
   services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the
   flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin
   as a token of respect.^[90]

Similar national flags[edit]

     * The flag of Bikini Atoll is symbolic of the islanders' belief that
       a great debt is still owed to the people of Bikini because in 1954
       the United States government detonated a thermonuclear bomb on the
       island as part of the Castle Bravo test.^[91]
     * The flag of Liberia bears a close resemblance, showing the
       ex-American-slave origin of the country.^[92] The Liberian flag has
       11 similar red and white stripes, which stand for the 11 signers of
       the Liberian Declaration of Independence, as well as a blue square
       with only a single large white star for the canton.
     * The Flag of the Republic of Texas is very similar as well and flew
       for seven years from 1839-1846 as the Country flag and for over 150
       years from 1846–present day as the State flag.
     * The flag of Togo resembles a Liberian flag with five stripes,
       though the colors are Pan-African colors.
     * The very short lived first flag of the Republic of Brazil (November
       15–19, 1889) resembles the U.S. flag, but uses green, yellow, and
       blue, the colors of the royal houses of Portugal and the Habsburgs.
     * The flag of El Salvador from 1865 to 1912. A different flag was in
       use, based on the flag of the United States, with a field of
       alternating blue and white stripes and a red canton containing
       white stars.
     * Despite Malaysia having no historical connections with the U.S.,
       the flag of Malaysia greatly resembles the U.S. flag. It is
       possible that the flag of the British East India Company influenced
       both the Malaysian and U.S. flag.^[6]
     * The flag of the Republic of Florida was very similar to the flag of
       the United States. It was flown for a few weeks in 1861 before
       Florida joined the Confederacy.

   36. ^ Note that the flag ratio (B/A in the diagram) is not absolutely
       fixed. Although the diagram in Executive Order 10834 gives a ratio
       of 1.9, earlier in the order is a list of flag sizes authorized for
       executive agencies. This list permits eleven specific flag sizes
       (specified by height and width) for such agencies: 20.00 × 38.00;
       10.00 × 19.00; 8.95 × 17.00; 7.00 × 11.00; 5.00 × 9.50; 4.33 ×
       5.50; 3.50 × 6.65; 3.00 × 4.00; 3.00 × 5.70; 2.37 × 4.50; and 1.32
       × 2.50. Eight of these sizes conform to the 1.9 ratio, within a
       small rounding error (less than 0.01). However, three of the
       authorized sizes vary significantly: 1.57 (for 7.00 × 11.00), 1.27
       (for 4.33 × 5.50) and 1.33 (for 3.00 × 4.00).

   41. ^ In the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card of America,
       "White", "Old Glory Red", and "Old Glory Blue" were, respectively,
       Cable No. 70001, Cable No. 70180, and Cable No. 70075. The Munsell
       renotation coordinates for these were taken directly from the
       Reimann et al. paper, the CIELAB D[65] coordinates were found by
       converting the xyY values in that paper to be relative to CIE
       Illuminant D[65] from Illuminant C using the CAT02 chromatic
       adaptation transform, and relative to a perfect diffuse reflector
       as white. The "relative" values in the table were found by taking
       Cable No. 70001’s luminosity to be that of the white point, and
       were converted to D[65] or D[50] also using the CAT02
       transformation. The values for CMYK were found by converting from
       the CIELAB D[50] values using the Adobe CMM and the GRACoL 2006 ICC
       profile in Adobe Photoshop.

   43. ^ In 1998, "U.S. Flag Facts" at the website of the U.S. embassy in
       London listed the colors red PMS 193 and blue PMS 282 (presumably
       PMS solid coated colors). By October 2002, these had changed to red
       PMS 193 and blue PMS 281. These latter PMS equivalents are listed
       on many websites including various other U.S. Government
       organizations, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s
       website. See also "United States of America", Flags of the World.

   45. ^ The values in this table were taken by converting the CIELAB
       D[50]coordinates for PMS 193 C, 200 C, and 281 C given in the
       Pantone color palettes of Adobe Photoshop to sRGB and GRACoL using
       the Adobe CMM and the GRACoL 2006 and sRGB profiles in Photoshop.
       Since PMS 281 C (blue) is outside the gamut of sRGB, and both PMS
       281 C and PMS 183 C (red) are outside the gamut of GRACoL, the RGB
       and CMYK values for those in the table below are necessarily
       less-colorful approximations to the colors of the Pantone swatches.
