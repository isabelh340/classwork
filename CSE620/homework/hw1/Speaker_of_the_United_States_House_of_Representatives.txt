   The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the chamber. The
   office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section 2 of the United
   States Constitution, which states in part, "The House of
   Representatives shall choose their Speaker..." The current Speaker is
   John Boehner, a Republican who represents Ohio's 8th congressional
   district. The Constitution does not require that the Speaker be an
   elected House Representative, though all Speakers have been an elected
   Member of Congress.^[1]

   The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of
   succession, after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro
   tempore of the U.S. Senate.^[2] Unlike some Westminster system
   parliaments, in which the office of Speaker is considered non-partisan,
   in the United States, the Speaker of the House is a leadership position
   and the office-holder actively works to set the majority party's
   legislative agenda. The Speaker usually does not personally preside
   over debates, instead delegating the duty to members of the House from
   the majority party.

   Aside from duties relating to heading the House and the majority
   political party, the Speaker also performs administrative and
   procedural functions, and represents his or her Congressional district.

Selection[edit]

   The House of Representatives elects^[clarification needed] the Speaker
   of the House on the first day of every new Congress and in the event of
   the death or resignation of an incumbent Speaker. The Clerk of the
   House of Representatives requests nominations: there are normally two,
   one from each major party (each party will have previously met to
   decide on its nominee). The Clerk then calls the roll of the
   Representatives-elect, each Representative-elect indicating the surname
   of the candidate he or she is supporting. Representatives-elect are not
   restricted to voting for one of the nominated candidates and may vote
   for any person, even for someone who is not a member (or member-elect)
   of the House at all. They may also abstain by voting "present".^[3]

   To be elected as Speaker, a candidate must receive an absolute majority
   of all votes cast for individuals, i.e. excluding those who abstain. If
   no candidate wins such a majority, then the roll call is repeated until
   a Speaker is elected. The last time repeated votes were required was in
   1923, when the Speaker was elected on the ninth ballot.^[3]

   The new Speaker is then sworn in by the Dean of the United States House
   of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member.

   In modern practice, the Speaker is chosen by the majority party from
   among its senior leaders either when a vacancy in the office arrives or
   when the majority party changes. It is usually obvious within two or
   three weeks of a House election who the new Speaker will be. Previous
   Speakers have been minority leaders (when the majority party changes,
   as they are already the House party leader, and as the minority leader
   are usually their party's nominee for Speaker), or majority leaders
   (upon departure of the current Speaker in the majority party), assuming
   that the party leadership hierarchy is followed. In the past, other
   candidates have included chairpersons of influential standing
   committees.

   So far, the Democrats have always elevated their minority leader to the
   Speakership upon reclaiming majority control of the House. However,
   Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession
   pattern. In 1919, Republicans bypassed James Robert Mann, R-IL, who had
   been Minority Leader for eight years, and elected a backbencher
   representative, Frederick H. Gillett, R-MA, to be Speaker. Mann had
   "angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the
   floor" and was also a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-IL
   (1903–1911), and many members "suspected that he would try to
   re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker."^[4] More
   recently, although Robert H. Michel was Minority Leader in 1994 when
   the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm
   elections, he had already announced his retirement and had little or no
   involvement in the campaign. Including the "Contract with America",
   which was unveiled six weeks before Election Day. Michel opted not to
   seek re-election because he had been isolated in the caucus by Minority
   Whip Newt Gingrich and other younger and more aggressive Congressmen.

   It is expected that members of the House vote for their party's
   candidate. If they do not, they usually vote for someone else in their
   party or vote "present". Those who vote for the other party's candidate
   often face serious consequences, up to and including the loss of
   seniority. The last instance where a representative voted for the other
   party's candidate was in 2000, when Democrat Jim Traficant of Ohio
   voted for Republican Dennis Hastert. In response, the Democrats
   stripped him of his seniority and he lost all of his committee posts.

   If the Speaker's party loses control of the House in an election, and
   if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership
   hierarchy, they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip,
   respectively. As the minority party has one less leadership position
   after losing the Speaker's chair, there may be a contest for the
   remaining leadership positions. Most Speakers whose party has lost
   control of the House have not returned to the party leadership (Tom
   Foley lost his seat, Dennis Hastert returned to the backbenches and
   resigned from the House in late 2007). However, Speakers Joseph William
   Martin, Jr. and Sam Rayburn did seek the post of Minority Leader in the
   late 1940s and early 1950s. Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of
   an outgoing Speaker who was elected Minority Leader, after the
   Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections.

History[edit]

   Frederick Muhlenberg (1789–1791, 1793–1795), was the first Speaker.

   The first Speaker was Frederick Muhlenberg, who was elected as a
   Federalist for the first four Congresses.^[5]

   The position of Speaker started to gain its partisan role and its power
   in legislative development under Henry Clay (1811–1814, 1815–1820, and
   1823–1825).^[6] In contrast to many of his predecessors, Clay
   participated in several debates, and used his influence to procure the
   passage of measures he supported—for instance, the declaration of the
   War of 1812, and various laws relating to Clay's "American System".
   Furthermore, when no candidate received an Electoral College majority
   in the 1824 presidential election causing the President to be elected
   by the House, Speaker Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams
   instead of Andrew Jackson, thereby ensuring Adams' victory. Following
   Clay's retirement in 1825, the power of the Speakership once again
   began to decline, despite Speakership elections becoming increasingly
   bitter. As the Civil War approached, several sectional factions
   nominated their own candidates, often making it difficult for any
   candidate to attain a majority. In 1855 and again in 1859, for example,
   the contest for Speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved
   a result. During this time, Speakers tended to have very short tenures.
   For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven Speakers, only one of
   whom served for more than one term. To date, James K. Polk is the only
   Speaker of the House later elected President of the United States.
   Henry Clay (1813–1814, 1815–1820, 1823–1825) used his influence as
   speaker to ensure the passage of measures he favored
   Joseph Gurney Cannon (1903–1911) was one of the most powerful speakers.

   Towards the end of the 19th century, the office of Speaker began to
   develop into a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most
   important sources of the Speaker's power was his position as Chairman
   of the Committee on Rules, which, after the reorganization of the
   committee system in 1880, became one of the most powerful standing
   committees of the House. Furthermore, several Speakers became leading
   figures in their political parties; examples include Democrats Samuel
   J. Randall, John Griffin Carlisle, and Charles F. Crisp, and
   Republicans James G. Blaine, Thomas Brackett Reed, and Joseph Gurney
   Cannon.

   The power of the Speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the
   Republican Thomas Brackett Reed (1889–1891, 1895–1899). "Czar Reed", as
   he was called by his opponents,^[7] sought to end the obstruction of
   bills by the minority, in particular by countering the tactic known as
   the "disappearing quorum".^[8] By refusing to vote on a motion, the
   minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved, and that the
   result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that members who were
   in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes
   of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed ensured
   that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.

   The Speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican Joseph
   Gurney Cannon (1903–1911). Cannon exercised extraordinary control over
   the legislative process. He determined the agenda of the House,
   appointed the members of all committees, chose committee chairmen,
   headed the Rules Committee, and determined which committee heard each
   bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals
   were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and several
   dissatisfied Republicans joined together to strip Cannon of many of his
   powers, including the ability to name committee members and his
   chairmanship of the Rules Committee.^[9] Fifteen years later, Speaker
   Nicholas Longworth restored much, but not all, of the lost influence of
   the position.

   One of the most influential Speakers in history was Democrat Sam
   Rayburn.^[10] Rayburn was the longest-serving Speaker in history,
   holding office from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. He
   helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House
   committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic
   measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents
   Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Rayburn's successor, Democrat
   John William McCormack (served 1962–1971), was a somewhat less
   influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger
   members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the power of the
   Speakership once again grew under Democrat Carl Albert. The Committee
   on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since
   1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership.
   Moreover, in 1975, the Speaker was granted the authority to appoint a
   majority of the members of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of
   committee chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative
   influence of the Speaker.

   Albert's successor, Democrat Tip O'Neill, was a prominent Speaker
   because of his public opposition to the policies of President Ronald
   Reagan. O'Neill is the longest continually serving Speaker, from 1977
   through 1987. He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense
   expenditures. Republicans made O'Neill the target of their election
   campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their
   majorities in both years.

   The roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty
   years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House
   with the "Contract with America", an idea spearheaded by Minority Whip
   Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic
   President Bill Clinton, leading to the United States federal government
   shutdown of 1995 and 1996, in which Clinton was largely seen to have
   prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly
   by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt
   in 1997. After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although
   retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as Speaker. His
   successor, Dennis Hastert, had been chosen as a compromise candidate,
   since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial.
   Hastert played a much less prominent role than other contemporary
   Speakers, being overshadowed by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and
   President George W. Bush. The Republicans came out of the 2000
   elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002
   and 2004. The periods of 2001-2002 and 2003-2007 were the first times
   since 1953-1955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in
   Washington, interrupted from 2001-2003 as Senator Jim Jeffords of
   Vermont left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused
   with Senate Democrats to give them a 51-49 majority.

   In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats won a majority in the
   House. Nancy Pelosi became Speaker when the 110th Congress convened on
   January 4, 2007, making her the first female to hold the office. With
   the election of Barack Obama as President and Democratic gains in both
   houses of Congress, Pelosi became the first Speaker since Tom Foley to
   hold the office during single-party Democratic leadership in
   Washington.^[11] During the 111th Congress, Pelosi was the driving
   force behind several of Obama's major initiatives that proved
   controversial, and the Republicans campaigned against the Democrats'
   legislation by staging a "Fire Pelosi" bus tour^[12] and regained
   control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections. House Minority
   Leader John Boehner was elected as Speaker.^[13]

   Historically, there have been several controversial elections to the
   Speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the
   26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not
   begin the Speakership election until December 14 because of an election
   dispute in New Jersey known as the "Broad Seal War". Two rival
   delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as
   elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem
   was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would
   determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither
   party agreed to permit a Speakership election with the opposite party's
   delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both
   delegations from the election and a Speaker was finally chosen on
   December 17.

   Another, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the 34th United
   States Congress. The old Whig Party had collapsed but no single party
   had emerged to replace it. Candidates opposing the Democrats had run
   under a bewildering variety of labels, including Whig, Republican,
   American (Know Nothing), and simply "Opposition". By the time Congress
   actually met in December 1855, most of the northerners were
   concentrated together as Republicans, while most of the southerners and
   a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label. Opponents of
   the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of the
   234 Representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know
   Nothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority
   nominated William A. Richardson of Illinois as Speaker, but because of
   sectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on
   a single candidate for Speaker. The Republicans supported Nathaniel
   Prentiss Banks of Massachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing
   but was now largely identified with the Republicans. The southern Know
   Nothings supported first Humphrey Marshall of Kentucky, and then Henry
   M. Fuller of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months
   with no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally
   agreed to elect the Speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was
   elected.^[14] The House found itself in a similar dilemma when the 36th
   Congress met in December 1859. Although the Republicans held a
   plurality, the Republican candidate, John Sherman, was unacceptable to
   southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again
   the House was unable to elect a Speaker for several months. After
   Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North
   Carolina oppositionist William N. H. Smith, Sherman finally withdrew in
   favor of compromise candidate William Pennington of New Jersey, a
   former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected
   Speaker at the end of January 1860.^[15]

   The last Speakership elections in which the House had to vote more than
   once occurred in the 65th and 72nd United States Congress. In 1917,
   neither the Republican nor the Democratic candidate could attain a
   majority because three members of the Progressive Party and other
   individual members of other parties voted for their own party. The
   Republicans had a plurality in the House but James "Champ" Clark
   remained Speaker of the House because of the support of the Progressive
   Party members. In 1931, both the Republicans and the Democrats had 217
   members with the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party having one member who
   served as the deciding vote. The Farmer-Labor Party eventually voted
   for the Democrats' candidate for Speaker, John Nance Garner, who later
   became Vice President under Franklin Roosevelt.

   In 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force
   Speaker Newt Gingrich to resign. However, Gingrich refused since that
   would have required a new election for Speaker, which could have led to
   Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat Dick
   Gephardt (then Minority Leader) as Speaker. After the 1998 midterm
   elections where the Republicans lost seats, Gingrich did not stand for
   re-election. The next two figures in the House Republican leadership
   hierarchy, Majority Leader Richard Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
   chose not to run for the office. The chairman of the House
   Appropriations Committee, Bob Livingston, declared his bid for the
   Speakership, which was unopposed, making him Speaker-designate. It was
   then revealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of
   President Bill Clinton's perjury during his sexual harassment trial,
   that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He opted to resign from
   the House, despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader
   Gephardt. Subsequently, chief deputy whip Dennis Hastert was selected
   as Speaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000,
   2002, and 2004 elections.

   address. President Bush acknowledged this by beginning his speech with
   the words, "Tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my
   own — as the first President to begin the State of the Union message
   with these words: Madam Speaker".^[16]

   The Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On
   November 16, 2006, Nancy Pelosi, who was then Minority Leader, was
   selected as Speaker-designate by House Democrats.^[17] When the 110th
   Congress convened on January 4, 2007, she was elected as the 60th
   Speaker by a vote of 233-202, becoming the first woman elected Speaker
   of the House. Pelosi remained Speaker through the 111th Congress. For
   the 112th Congress, Republican John Boehner was unanimously designated
   Speaker-designate by House Republicans and was elected the 61st Speaker
   of the House. As a show of dissent, nineteen Democratic representatives
   voted for Democrats other than Pelosi, who had been chosen as House
   Minority Leader and the Democrats' candidate for Speaker.

Partisan role[edit]

   The Constitution does not spell out the political role of the Speaker.
   As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a
   clearly partisan cast, very different from the Speakership of most
   Westminster-style legislatures, such as the Speaker of the British
   House of Commons, which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The
   Speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority
   party in the House of Representatives, outranking the Majority Leader.
   However, despite having the right to vote, the Speaker usually does not
   participate in debate and rarely votes.

   The Speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes
   legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the
   Speaker may use his or her power to determine when each bill reaches
   the floor. They also chair the majority party's steering committee in
   the House. While the Speaker is the functioning head of the House
   majority party, the same is not true of the President pro tempore of
   the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary.

   When the Speaker and the President belong to the same party, the
   Speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when
   Dennis Hastert played a very low-key role during the presidency of
   fellow Republican George W. Bush. Nevertheless, there are times when
   the Speaker plays a much larger role if the President is a fellow
   member of their party, and thus, the Speaker is tasked with pushing
   through the agenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the
   minority opposition. This can be seen, most of all, in the Speakership
   of Democratic-Republican Henry Clay, who personally ensured the
   presidential victory of fellow Democratic-Republican John Quincy Adams.
   On the other side of the aisle, Democrat Sam Rayburn was a key player
   in the passing of New Deal legislation under the presidency of fellow
   Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon
   (under Theodore Roosevelt) was particularly infamous for his
   marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority
   to the Speakership. In more recent times, Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a
   role in continuing the push for health care reform during the
   presidency of fellow Democrat Barack Obama.^[18] The Republicans
   campaigned against Pelosi and the Democrats' legislation with their
   "Fire Pelosi" bus tour.^[12]^[19]^[20]^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]^[25]^[26]

   On the other hand, when the Speaker and the President belong to
   opposite parties, the public role and influence of the Speaker tend to
   increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and in
   effect a de facto Leader of the Opposition), the Speaker is normally
   the chief public opponent of the President's agenda. In this scenario,
   the Speaker is known for undercutting the President's agenda by
   blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the
   Senate. One famous instance came in the form of Thomas Brackett Reed
   (under Grover Cleveland), a Speaker notorious for his successful
   attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the
   Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's
   Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the
   House. Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the
   conservative "Old Guard" wing of the Republican Party, while his
   President - Theodore Roosevelt - was of the more progressive clique,
   and more than just marginalizing the Democrats, Cannon used his power
   to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing
   of the Republican Party.

   More modern examples include Tip O'Neill, who was a vocal opponent of
   President Ronald Reagan's economic and defense policies; Newt Gingrich,
   who fought a bitter battle with President Bill Clinton for control of
   domestic policy; Nancy Pelosi, who clashed with President George W.
   Bush over the Iraq War;^[13] and current Speaker John Boehner, who
   clashes with President Barack Obama over budget issues and health
   care.^[27]

   As presiding office of the House of Representatives, the Speaker holds
   a variety of powers over the House but usually delegates them to
   another member of the majority party. The Speaker may designate any
   member of the House to act as Speaker pro tempore and preside over the
   House. During important debates, the Speaker pro tempore is ordinarily
   a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his or her
   skill in presiding. At other times, more junior members may be assigned
   to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the
   House. The Speaker may also designate a Speaker pro tempore for special
   purposes, such as designating a Representative whose district is near
   Washington, DC to sign enrolled bills during long recesses.

   On the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as
   "Mister Speaker" or "Madam Speaker," even if it is a Speaker pro
   tempore, and not the Speaker him- or herself. When the House resolves
   itself into a Committee of the Whole, the Speaker designates a member
   to preside over the Committee as the Chairman, who is addressed as
   "Mister Chairman" or "Madam Chairwoman." To speak, members must seek
   the presiding officer's recognition. The presiding officer may call on
   members as they please, and may therefore control the flow of debate.
   The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such
   rulings may be appealed to the whole House. The Speaker is responsible
   for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the Sergeant-at-Arms
   to enforce House rules.

   The Speaker's powers and duties extend beyond presiding in the chamber.
   In particular, the Speaker has great influence over the committee
   process. The Speaker selects nine of the thirteen members of the
   powerful Committee on Rules, subject to the approval of the entire
   majority party. The leadership of the minority party chooses remaining
   four members. Furthermore, the Speaker appoints all members of select
   committees and conference committees. Moreover, when a bill is
   introduced, the Speaker determines which committee will consider it. As
   a member of the House, the Speaker is entitled to participate in debate
   and to vote but, by custom, only does so in exceptional circumstances.
   Ordinarily, the Speaker votes only when his or her vote would be
   decisive or on matters of great importance, such as constitutional
   amendments or major legislation.

Other functions[edit]

   The speaker's office in the US Capitol, during the term of Dennis
   Hastert (1999 to 2007).

   Because joint sessions and joint meetings of Congress are held in the
   House chamber, the Speaker presides over all such joint sessions and
   meetings. However, the Twelfth Amendment and 3 U.S.C. § 15 require that
   the President of the Senate preside over joint sessions of Congress
   assembled to count electoral votes and to certify the results of a
   presidential election.

   The Speaker is also responsible for overseeing the officers of the
   House: the Clerk, the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chief Administrative
   Officer, and the Chaplain. The Speaker can dismiss any of these
   officers. The Speaker appoints the House Historian and the General
   Counsel and, jointly with the Majority and Minority Leaders, appoints
   the House Inspector General.

   The Speaker is second in the presidential line of succession,
   immediately after the Vice President, under the Presidential Succession
   Act of 1947. The Speaker is followed in the line of succession by the
   President pro tempore of the Senate and by the heads of federal
   executive departments. Some scholars argue that this provision of the
   succession statute is unconstitutional.^[28]

   To date, the implementation of the Presidential Succession Act has
   never been necessary and no Speaker has ever acted as President.
   Implementation of the law almost became necessary in 1973 after the
   resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew. At the time, many believed
   that President Richard Nixon would resign because of the Watergate
   scandal, allowing Speaker Carl Albert to succeed to the Presidency.
   However, before he resigned, Nixon appointed Gerald Ford as Vice
   President in accordance with the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Nevertheless,
   the United States government takes the Speaker's place in the line of
   succession seriously enough that, for example, since shortly after the
   terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Speakers used military jets to
   fly back and forth to their districts and for other travel until
   Speaker Boehner discontinued the practice in 2011. The Speaker of the
   House is one of the officers to whom declarations of presidential
   inability or ability to resume the Presidency must be addressed under
   the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

   * Note: Banks, a former Democrat originally elected as a Know Nothing,
   had come to be associated with the Republicans by the time the 34th
   Congress convened. Because the Republicans did not command a majority
   in Congress, and Banks did not receive any votes from Democrats or
   southern Know Nothings, Banks, after two months of deadlocked
   balloting, could only be elected after a motion was passed allowing the
   election of a speaker by plurality vote.

List of Speakers by time in office[edit]

                                                         17 years, 53 days
                                            Sam Rayburn from 1940 to 1947,
                                            1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961

                                                         9 years, 350 days
                                             Tip O'Neill from 1977 to 1987

                                                         8 years, 344 days
                                       John W. McCormack from 1962 to 1971

                                                                   4 years
                                           Nancy Pelosi from 2007 to 2011.
             The first woman in United States history to serve as Speaker.

                                                                  275 days
                                               John Bell from 1834 to 1835

                                                                  257 days
                                         Michael C. Kerr from 1875 to 1876

                                                                     1 day
                                               Theodore M. Pomeroy in 1869

   This list is based on the difference between dates; if counted by
   number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater. Time
   after adjournment of one Congress but before the convening of the next
   Congress is not counted. For example, Nathaniel Macon was Speaker in
   both the 8th and 9th Congresses, but the eight-month gap between the
   two Congresses is not counted toward his service.

   Sam Rayburn is the only person to have served as Speaker of the House
   for more than ten years.

   Theodore M. Pomeroy served as Speaker of the House for one day after
   Speaker Schuyler Colfax resigned to become Vice President of the United
   States; Pomeroy's term as a Member of Congress ended the next day.

   Sam Rayburn, Henry Clay, Thomas Brackett Reed, Joseph William Martin,
   Jr., Frederick Muhlenberg, and John W. Taylor are the only Speakers of
   the House to have ever served in non-consecutive Congresses (i.e.
   another Speaker served in between each tenure).
