   United States v. Darby Lumber Co., 312 U.S. 100 (1941)^[1], was a case
   in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the Fair Labor
   Standards Act of 1938, holding that the U.S. Congress had the power
   under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions. The
   unanimous decision of the Court in this case overturned Hammer v.
   Dagenhart 247 U.S. 251 (1918), limited the application of Carter v.
   Carter Coal Company 298 U.S. 238 (1936), and confirmed the underlying
   legality of minimum wages held in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish 300
   U.S. 379 (1937).

The issue[edit]

   The issue was whether Congress had overstepped its constitutional
   authority in creating the Fair Labor Standards Act. An American lumber
   company in Georgia that did not meet these standards was charged with
   violating the law, but had won an appeal, where the appellate judge
   found that the federal government is barred by the 10th Amendment from
   interfering in matters that are strictly local, that is, within state
   boundaries. The Act also required the keeping of records to verify
   compliance; the appellee argued that this violated his 5th Amendment
   right protecting him from self-incrimination.

The decision[edit]

   The Court reversed the appellate court decision. It affirmed the
   constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, which
   power "can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or
   non-exercise of state power." FindLaw. The Court held that the purpose
   of the Act was to prevent states from using substandard labor practices
   to their own economic advantage through interstate commerce. In the
   Dagenhart case, the Court had made the distinction between
   manufacturing and interstate commerce, so that a business could argue
   it was engaging in the former, but had not intended the latter.
   Twenty-two years later, the Court found that earlier argument facile,
   explaining that Congress was well aware that businesses produce their
   goods without thought to where they will go; product is pulled and
   shipped to meet the orders of the day. The Court also found that the
   requirement of record keeping was entirely appropriate as a matter of
   enforcing the Act.

   There were no dissenting opinions in this case.
