Naming in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   The United States has very few laws governing given names. This freedom
   has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends. Naming
   traditions play a role in the cohesion and communication within
   American cultures. Cultural diversity in America has led to great
   variations in names. American naming traditions and names have been
   used to express creativity, personality, cultural identity, and
   values.^[1]^[2]

Naming Laws[edit]

   Traditionally, the right to name your child or yourself as you choose
   has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted in the Due Process
   Clause of the fourteenth Amendment and the Free Speech Clause of the
   First Amendment, but a few restrictions do exist. Restrictions vary by
   state, but most are for the sake of practicality. For example, several
   states limit the number of characters you may use due to the
   limitations of the software used for official record keeping. For
   similar reasons, some states ban the use of numerical digits or
   pictograms. A few states ban the use of obscenity. There are also a few
   states, Kentucky for instance, that have no naming laws whatsoever.

   One naming law that some find restrictive is California’s ban on
   diacritical marks, such as in the name José. The Office of Vital
   Records in California requires that names contain only the 26
   alphabetical characters of the English language. There is no law
   restricting the use of diacritical marks informally and many parents
   get around the restrictions by doing so.^[1]

   Despite the freedom that Americans have regarding names, controversies
   do exist. In 2013, Tennessee judge Lu Ann Ballew ruled that a baby boy
   named Messiah must change his name to Martin stating “it’s a title that
   has only been earned by one person … Jesus Christ.” The decision was
   overturned in chancery court a month later and he retained his birth
   name. Ballew was fired and a disciplinary hearing was scheduled on the
   basis that the name change order violated Tennessee's code of Judicial
   Conduct. No laws exist banning the use of religious names and judges
   are required to perform their duties without regard to religious
   bias.^[3]^[4]

   In 2009, a three-year-old named Adolf Hitler Campbell made headlines
   after a bakery refused to put the name on the child's birthday cake.
   The name drew widespread outrage, along with the names of his siblings,
   who also had names inspired by Hitler's regime, but they were
   nonetheless legal. Adolf and his siblings were later removed from the
   home and placed in foster care on the basis of other issues. The
   Campbells deny that any abuse occurred and assert their children were
   removed solely on the basis of their names.^[5]

African American Names[edit]

   Main article: African-American names
   The names in the Jackson family show the variety within
   African-American culture. La Toya is an inventive African-American
   name, Jermaine is French, Michael and Janet are common biblical names

   Many Black Americans use their own or their children's names as a
   symbol of solidarity within their culture. Prior to the 1950s and
   1960s, most African American names closely resembled those used within
   European American culture. With the rise of the mid-century civil
   rights movement, there was a dramatic rise in names of various origins.
   One very notable influence on African American names is the Muslim
   religion. Islamic names entered the popular culture with the rise of
   The Nation of Islam among Black Americans with its focus on civil
   rights. The popular name "Aisha" has origins in the Koran. Other Muslim
   names such as Jamal and Malik are now commonly used by African
   Americans regardless of religion.^[2]

   Many names of French origin entered the picture at this time as well.
   Historically French names such as Monique, Chantal, André, and Antoine
   became so common within African American culture that many Americans
   began to think of them solely as "Black names". Names of African origin
   began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, Tanisha, Aaliyah, Malaika
   have origins in the continent of Africa.^[2]

   By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within the culture to
   invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements
   from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re, or
   Ja/Je and suffixes such as -ique/iqua, -isha, and -aun/-awn are common,
   as well as inventive spellings for common names. The name LaKeisha is
   typically considered American in origin, but has elements pulled from
   both French and African roots. Other names like LaTanisha, JaMarcus,
   DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks
   are seen more often within African American names than other American
   names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.^[2]^[6]

   Even with the rise of creative names, it is also still common for
   African Americans to use biblical, historic, or European names. Daniel,
   Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were among the
   most common names for African American boys in 2013.^[2]^[7]^[8]

   African American names are subject to the same prejudice that African
   Americans face. Studies on the topic found that job applicants with
   Black-sounding names were 50% less likely to get a call back after
   submitting resumes than applicants with white sounding names submitting
   similar resumes.^[9]^[10] African American naming trends are often
   misunderstood, maligned and sometimes referred to as the pejorative
   term "ghetto names". Many experts assert that this criticism is solely
   a manifestation of racism as many other American cultures have used
   inventive names extensively without the same condemnation.^[2]^[8] For
   example, the Puritans had a deep tradition of expressing their values
   through creative names, many in the form of virtue names like Grace,
   Felicity, Chastity or Hope. These names have entered the standard
   American usage without issue. Vanessa, Wendy, Jayden, and Scarlett are
   also names invented in the past century that do not have stigma
   attached to them as well as invented spellings such as Haleigh and
   Jaxon.^[11]^[12]^[13]

Surname names[edit]

   Using surnames as a first name is increasingly popular in America,
   although the origin of this practice is dubious. In one of her books
   about southern culture, Marlyn Schwartz reports that it has long been
   common for southern families to use family surnames as first
   names.^[13] The Baby Name Wizard author Laura Wattenberg explains that
   the practice became popular in the early 1900s as poor immigrants chose
   names they associated with the sophistication of English Aristocracy
   and literature, many of them surnames. Regardless of origins, many
   names that are now considered first names in America have origins as
   surnames. Names like Riley, Parker, Cooper, Madison, and Harper
   originated as surnames. Names that originate as surnames typically
   start out their lifespan as androgynous names before developing a
   common usage as either a boy's name or a girl's name. Tyler and Taylor
   had approximately the same usage for both boys and girls when they came
   onto the charts before diverging. Tyler is now typically used for boys
   while Taylor is more often used for girls.^[2]

Names inspired by popular culture[edit]

   The Twilight series was a very influential force on American naming
   trends

   Without laws governing name usage, many American names pop up following
   the name's usage in movies, television, or in the media. One notable
   example is the name Madison. Prior to the 1984 movie Splash, Madison
   was almost solely heard as a surname, with occasional usage as a boy's
   name. The name entered the top 1000 list for girls in 1985 and has been
   a top 10 name since 1997.^[2] The Twilight series was another
   influential force in American names. While most of the names were
   established historical names, their collective rise in popularity
   corresponded with Twilight's popularity. The previously obscure name
   Esme entered the top 1000 names in America in 2010 after its use in the
   Twilight series.^[14]^[15]

   Names in popular culture fare better as inspiration if they fit in with
   current naming trends. When Barack Obama was inaugurated as president
   in 2009, his name had a surge in popularity, but still has not made it
   into the top 1000 names in America. His daughter Malia, on the other
   hand, jumped over 200 spots to the 191st spot that year. While Barack
   is much more influential than his daughter, Barack is an obscure
   Swahili name with a sound unlike other top boys names. Malia is
   Hawaiian, but sounds similar to top names like Amelia and Sophia. Names
   that fit current naming trends and have prestige attached to them fare
   especially well. The name Blair surfaced as a girl's name in the
   mid-1980s after being featured on the The Facts of Life as the name of
   the wealthy character Blair Warner. Blair had previously been used
   infrequently and mostly as a boy's name. When the series aired, the
   perceived prestige of the name escalated and fit into the surname name
   trend.^[2]^[14]^[16]

   A number of names have entered common American usage following the
   popularity of a luxury brand. The name Tiffany began its lifespan
   solely as a surname. It was popularized as a given name in the late
   60's and 70's because of the success of the luxury jewelry store
   Tiffany & co. Names like Mercedes and Cristal have the same origins as
   the names of luxury brands. The perception of names taken from luxury
   brands is mixed. Families of low socioeconomic status are more likely
   to use luxury brand names than families of higher socioeconomic
   backgrounds for the same aspirational reasons as surname names are
   used. This name usage leads to the association that the names
   themselves are lower class names. A few examples of luxury brand
   inspired names have had usage throughout the socioeconomic spectrum.
   Lauren was relatively uncommon until Ralph Lauren became a popular
   clothier. At the height of its popularity, it was used widely. Tiffany
   also had widespread usage.^[2]^[16]

   Some names have a variety of factors that inspire their popularity. The
   name Bentley was inspired by the luxury car brand, but got a further
   boost by the show Teen Mom when reality star Maci Bookout used the name
   for her son. The already popular name Tiffany had a rise in usage
   following the popularity of the singer Tiffany in the
   mid-80's.^[2]^[15]^[16]

Religion[edit]

   Religious names are extremely popular in the United States. Most of the
   popular names are rooted in the bible, but other religions are
   represented, such as in the popular name Mohammed. Names like Jacob,
   Noah, Elijah, John, Elizabeth, Leah, and Jesus consistently rank very
   high. Some parents choose names for their religious significance, but
   there are also many parents who choose names based in religion because
   they are family names or simply because they are culturally popular.
   Other popular names are inspired by religion in other ways such as
   Nevaeh, which is Heaven spelled backwards. Christian, Faith, Angel,
   Trinity, Genesis, Jordan, Zion, and Eden are names which reference
   religion.^[2]^[14]^[16]

Gender[edit]

   Research suggests that American parents are more likely to use
   established, historical names for boys and are much more likely to name
   boys after relatives and ancestors. Boys' names, on average, are more
   traditional than girls' names, and are less likely to be currently
   fashionable. This trend holds true across racial lines. There is a much
   quicker turnover within girls' names than boys'. Parents of girls are
   much more likely to demonstrate their creativity in the naming of their
   daughters than their sons. In Alice Rossi's 1965 study of naming
   conventions, she theorizes that the gender differences in naming
   strategies exist because of the perceived roles of men and women in
   society. "Women play the more crucial role in family and kin
   activities, while men are the symbolic carriers of temporal continuity
   of the family." In other words, women's names are less crucial to
   family cohesiveness because their actions create that bond. Men are
   named after family to fill that gap in their role as kin keepers.
   Others theorize that women are given fanciful names for the same
   reasons that women wear cosmetics and more decorative clothing than
   men, and men are given traditional family names to encourage them to
   build the family name.^[17]

   Gender name usage also plays a role in the way parents view names. It
   is not uncommon for American parents to give girls names that have
   traditionally been used for boys. Boys, on the other hand, are almost
   never given feminine names. Names like Ashley, Sidney, Aubrey, and
   Avery originated as boys' names. Traditionally masculine or androgynous
   names that are used widely for girls have a tendency to be abandoned by
   the parents of boys and develop an almost entirely female usage.^[2]

Other Factors[edit]

   Research has demonstrated that a number of factors come into play when
   it comes to naming strategies. Families with the most education are
   more likely to use traditional names or family names than families with
   less education. This seems to be true across racial lines. Also, higher
   socioeconomic status families tend to choose different names than lower
   SES families. Over time, the lower socioeconomic status families
   gravitate toward those names. As those names catch on with the lower
   SES families, higher SES families abandon them. The name Ashley was
   popular among higher SES families in the early 1980s, but by the late
   80's was most popular with lower SES families. The name Madison is
   still on the top 10 list, but is used largely by lower socioeconomic
   status families.^[16]

   Political status also seems to impact naming strategies. A study on
   babies born in 2004 in California found that conservatives were less
   likely to give their children unusual names than liberals. This holds
   true even across racial and socioeconomic lines. Among families who had
   less than a college education, political leanings made no major
   difference in naming trends, however, the study found that the less
   education the parents had, the more likely they were to use an uncommon
   name or spelling. But among caucasian families with a college
   education, conservative families chose different names than liberal
   families. College educated liberals were more likely to choose unusual
   names than college educated conservatives.

   However, while they both choose unusual names, the high SES college
   educated liberals had different naming strategies than low SES
   families. Low SES families choose invented names or invented spellings,
   while high SES liberals chose established names that are simply
   culturally obscure like Finnegan or Archimedes. Higher SES
   conservatives commonly choose common historical names.

   The research found that the sounds chosen by liberals and conservatives
   varied as well. Liberals "favor birth names with ‘softer, feminine’
   sounds while conservatives favor names with ‘harder, masculine’
   phonemes.”^[18]

Trends[edit]

   Baby name trends change frequently for girls and somewhat less
   frequently for boys. Boys' names tend to be more traditional, but
   Ethan, Liam, Aiden, Logan, Jayden, and Sebastian are currently seeing a
   spike in popularity. One recent trend is place names. Names like
   London, Brooklyn, Sydney, Alexandria, Paris, and Phoenix are all seeing
   a spike in popularity as of the 2012 report by the social security
   administration. Most place names are used for girls, but some are used
   for boys as well, such as Dallas and Austin. A few of the more exotic
   place names like Kenya, China, and Asia have been used by African
   Americans for years.^[2]^[14]^[16]^[19]

   Names containing "belle" or "bella" are very common, such as Isabella
   or Annabelle. Names that end in an "a" like Sophia, Ella, Olivia, and
   Amelia are also very common for baby girls.^[20]

   Diversity among American names also seems to be increasing. In the
   1950s, most babies were given a few very common names with children
   using nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name.
   In the decades since, the number of names being used has increased
   dramatically.^[21] It is also more common for minorities to use
   traditional cultural names for their children and for themselves that
   are obscure in America. It used to be common to choose names that were
   likely to fit in with the larger American culture. This applied to both
   given names and surnames. Research suggests that fewer immigrants
   change their names today upon moving to America than they once did.
   Princeton University sociologist Douglas Massey believes that
   immigrants felt less pressure to change their names “during the 1970s
   and 1980s, as immigration became more a part of American life and the
   civil rights movement legitimated in-group pride as something to be
   cultivated”, and that seeing celebrities like the Kardashian family use
   their original Armenian surname reinforces the normality of cultural
   diversity.^[21]^[22]

   San Diego State University professor Jean Twenge believes that the
   shift toward unique baby names is one facet of the cultural shift in
   America that values individuality over conformity.^[21]
