Text[edit]

     The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be
     sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the
     States so ratifying the Same.^[1]

Background[edit]

   On September 20, 1787, three days after its adoption by the
   Constitutional Convention, the drafted Constitution was submitted to
   the Congress of the Confederation for its endorsement. After a great
   deal of debate, the opposing sides came to the first of many
   compromises that would define the ratification process. Thus, on
   September 28, the Confederation Congress voted to release the proposed
   Constitution to the states for their consideration without comment. In
   other words, Congress would neither endorse nor oppose its
   ratification.^[2]

Implementation[edit]

   In 1787 and 1788, following the Constitutional Convention, a great
   debate took place throughout the United States over the Constitution
   that had been proposed. The supporters of the Constitution began the
   ratification campaign in those states where there was little or no
   controversy, postponing until later the more difficult ones.

   New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the proposed
   constitution on June 21, 1788, thus establishing it as the new
   framework of governance for the United States. Though officially
   enacted, four states, Virginia, New York, North Carolina and Rhode
   Island remained outside the new government. The Congress of the
   Confederation chose March 4, 1789 as the day "for commencing
   proceedings under the Constitution." Virginia and New York ratified the
   Constitution before that time, while North Carolina and Rhode Island
   ratified after the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for
   ratification.

   The Constitution was ratified by the states in the following order:^[3]
            Date            State       Votes    % Approval
                                       Yea  Nay
    1 December 7, 1787  Delaware         30   0        100%
    2 December 12, 1787 Pennsylvania     46  23         67%
    3 December 18, 1787 New Jersey       38   0        100%

   10 June 25, 1788     Virginia         89  79         53%
   11 July 26, 1788     New York         30  27         53%
   12 November 21, 1789 North Carolina  194  77         72%
   13 May 29, 1790      Rhode Island     34  32         52%
                                Total: 1071 577         65%
