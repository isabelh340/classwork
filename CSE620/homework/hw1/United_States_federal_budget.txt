   Fiscal Year 2013 U.S. Federal Spending – Cash or Budget Basis.
   Fiscal Year 2013 U.S. Federal Receipts.

   The Budget of the United States Government often begins as the
   President's proposal to the U.S. Congress which recommends funding
   levels for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1. However, Congress
   is the body required by law to pass appropriations annually and to
   submit funding bills passed by both houses to the President for
   signature. Congressional decisions are governed by rules and
   legislation regarding the federal budget process. Budget committees set
   spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for
   Appropriations subcommittees, which then approve individual
   appropriations bills to allocate funding to various federal programs.

   If Congress fails to pass an annual budget, a series of Appropriations
   bills must be passed as "stop gap" measures. After Congress approves an
   appropriations bill, it is sent to the President, who may sign it into
   law, or may veto it (as he would a budget when passed by the Congress).
   A vetoed bill is sent back to Congress, which can pass it into law with
   a two-thirds majority in each chamber. Congress may also combine all or
   some appropriations bills into an omnibus reconciliation bill. In
   addition, the president may request and the Congress may pass
   supplemental appropriations bills or emergency supplemental
   appropriations bills.

   Several government agencies provide budget data and analysis. These
   include the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional
   Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S.
   Treasury Department. These agencies have reported that the federal
   government is facing a series of important long-run financing
   challenges, primarily driven by an aging population and spending for
   healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In the short-term,
   deficits are projected to return to their historical average relative
   to the size of the economy by 2014.^[1]

Budget principles[edit]

   The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that "No
   money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of
   Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of
   Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from
   time to time."

   Each year, the President of the United States submits his budget
   request to Congress for the following fiscal year as required by the
   Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. Current law (31 U.S.C. § 1105(a))
   requires the president to submit a budget no earlier than the first
   Monday in January, and no later than the first Monday in February.
   Typically, presidents submit budgets on the first Monday in February.
   The budget submission has been delayed, however, in some new
   presidents' first year when the previous president belonged to a
   different party.

   The federal budget is calculated largely on a cash basis. That is,
   revenues and outlays are recognized when transactions are made.
   Therefore, the full long-term costs of entitlement programs such as
   Medicare, Social Security, and the federal portion of Medicaid are not
   reflected in the federal budget. By contrast, many businesses and some
   other national governments have adopted forms of accrual accounting,
   which recognizes obligations and revenues when they are incurred. The
   costs of some federal credit and loan programs, according to provisions
   of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, are calculated on a net
   present value basis.^[2]

   Federal agencies cannot spend money unless funds are authorized and
   appropriated. Typically, separate Congressional committees have
   jurisdiction over authorization and appropriations. The House and
   Senate Appropriations Committees currently have 12 subcommittees, which
   are responsible for drafting the 12 regular appropriations bills that
   determine amounts of discretionary spending for various federal
   programs. Appropriations bills must pass both the House and Senate and
   then be signed by the president in order to give federal agencies the
   legal budget authority to spend.^[3] In many recent years, regular
   appropriations bills have been combined into "omnibus" bills.

   Congress may also pass "special" or "emergency" appropriations.
   Spending that is deemed an "emergency" is exempt from certain
   Congressional budget enforcement rules. Funds for disaster relief have
   sometimes come from supplemental appropriations, such as after
   Hurricane Katrina. In other cases, funds included in emergency
   supplemental appropriations bills support activities not obviously
   related to actual emergencies, such as parts of the 2000 Census of
   Population and Housing. Special appropriations have been used to fund
   most of the costs of war and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan so far.

   Budget resolutions and appropriations bills, which reflect spending
   priorities of Congress, will usually differ from funding levels in the
   president's budget. The president, however, retains substantial
   influence over the budget process through his veto power and through
   his congressional allies when his party has a majority in Congress.

Budget authority versus outlays[edit]

   The amount of budget authority and outlays for a fiscal year usually
   differ because the government can incur obligations for future years.
   This means that budget authority from a previous fiscal year can, in
   many cases, be used for expenditure of funds in future fiscal years;
   for example, a multi-year contract.

   Budget authority is the legal authority provided by federal law to
   enter into financial obligations that will result in immediate or
   future outlays involving federal government funds. Outlays refer to the
   issuance of checks, disbursement of cash or electronic transfer of
   funds made to liquidate a federal obligation and is usually synonymous
   with "expenditure" or "spending." The term "appropriations" refers to
   budget authority to incur obligations and to make payments from the
   Treasury for specified purposes. Some military and some housing
   programs have multi-year appropriations, in which their budget
   authority is specified for several coming fiscal years.

   In the congressional budgeting process, an "authorization" (technically
   the "authorization act") provides the legal authority for the executive
   branch to act, establishes an account which can receive money to
   implement the action, and sets a limit on how much money may be
   expended. However, this account remains empty until Congress approves
   an "appropriation", which requires the U.S. Treasury to provide funds
   (up to the limit provided for in the authorization). Congress is not
   required to appropriate as much money as is authorized.^[4]

   Congress may both authorize and appropriate in the same bill. Known as
   "authorization bills", such legislation usually provides for a
   multi-year authorization and appropriation. Authorization bills are
   particularly useful when funding entitlement programs (benefits which
   federal law says an individual has a right to, regardless if any money
   is appropriated), where estimating the amount of funds to be spent is
   difficult. Authorization bills are also useful when giving a federal
   agency the right to borrow money, sign contracts, or provide loan
   guarantees. In 2007, two-thirds of all federal spending came through
   authorization bills.^[5]

   A "backdoor authorization" occurs when an appropriation is made and an
   agency required to spend the money even when no authorizing legislation
   has been enacted. A "backdoor appropriation" occurs when authorizing
   legislation requires an agency to spend a specific amount of money on a
   specific project within a specific period of time. Because the agency
   would be violating the law if it did not do so, it is required to spend
   the money — even if no appropriation has been made. Backdoor
   appropriations are particularly vexsome because removing the
   appropriate requires amending federal law, which is often politically
   impossible to do within a short period of time. Backdoor authorizations
   and appropriations are sources of significant friction in Congress.
   Authorization and appropriations committees jealously guard their
   legislative rights, and the congressional budgeting process can break
   down when committees overstep their boundaries and are retaliated
   against.^[6]

Federal budget data[edit]

   Several government agencies provide budget data. These include the
   Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office
   (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury
   Department. The CBO publishes The Budget and Economic Outlook in
   January, which covers a ten-year window and is typically updated in
   August. It also publishes a Long-Term Budget Outlook in July and a
   Monthly Budget Review. The OMB, which is responsible for organizing the
   President's budget presented in February, typically issues a budget
   update in July. The GAO and the Treasury issue Financial Statements of
   the U.S. Government, usually in the December following the close of the
   federal fiscal year, which occurs September 30. There is a
   corresponding Citizen's Guide, a short summary. The Treasury Department
   also produces a Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances
   each December for the preceding fiscal year, which provides detailed
   data on federal financial activities.

   Historical tables within the President's Budget (OMB) provide a wide
   range of data on federal government finances. Many of the data series
   begin in 1940 and include estimates of the President’s Budget for
   2009–2014. Additionally, Table 1.1 provides data on receipts, outlays,
   and surpluses or deficits for 1901–1939 and for earlier multi-year
   periods. This document is composed of 17 sections, each of which has
   one or more tables. Each section covers a common theme. Section 1, for
   example, provides an overview of the budget and off-budget totals;
   Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source; and Section 3 shows
   outlays by function. When a section contains several tables, the
   general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data
   and then work down to more detailed tables. The purpose of these tables
   is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one
   convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely
   to be most useful. The most common comparisons are in terms of
   proportions (e.g., each major receipt category as a percentage of total
   receipts and of the gross domestic product).^[7]

Federal budget projections[edit]

   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects budget data such as
   revenues, expenses, deficits, and debt as part of its "Long-term Budget
   Outlook" which is released annually. The 2014 Outlook included
   projections for debt through 2039 and beyond. CBO outlined several
   scenarios that result in a range of outcomes. The "Extended Baseline"
   scenario and "Extended Alternative Fiscal" scenario both result in a
   much higher level of debt relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as
   the country ages and healthcare costs rise faster than the rate of
   economic growth. CBO also identified scenarios involving significant
   austerity measures, which maintain or reduce the debt relative to GDP
   over time.^[8]

   The sooner austerity steps are taken (e.g., raising revenues or
   reducing spending or a combination of both), the smaller those changes
   can be to maintain or reduce the debt level projected in 2039. For
   example, under the baseline scenario, stabilizing the ratio of debt to
   GDP at 74% (its current level) would require non-interest spending cuts
   and/or tax hikes of 1.2% of GDP annually if implemented in 2015, or
   1.5% of GDP annually if begun in 2020. To bring the debt to GDP ratio
   back to its 40-year average of 39%, the austerity measures required
   would be 2.6% GDP if begun in 2015 and 3.2% GDP if begun in 2020. Over
   the 1974 to 2013 period, federal spending averaged 20.5% GDP and
   revenue 17.4% GDP. For scale, a 2% GDP reduction in spending would be
   approximately a 10% spending cut.^[8]

Major receipt categories[edit]

   Main article: Taxation in the United States

   During FY2013, the federal government collected approximately $2.77
   trillion in tax revenue, up $326 billion or 13% versus FY2012 revenues
   of $2.45 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual
   income taxes ($1,316B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes
   ($948B or 34%), and corporate taxes ($274B or 10%). Other revenue types
   included excise, estate and gift taxes. Revenues rose across all
   categories in FY2013 versus FY2012 as tax cuts expired and the economy
   improved.^[9]

   FY2013 revenues were 16.7% GDP, versus 15.2% GDP in FY2012.^[9] Tax
   revenues averaged approximately 18.3% of gross domestic product (GDP)
   over the 1970-2009 period, generally ranging plus or minus 2% from that
   level. Tax revenues are significantly affected by the economy.
   Recessions typically reduce government tax collections as economic
   activity slows. For example, tax revenues declined from $2.5 trillion
   in 2008 to $2.1 trillion in 2009, and remained at that level in 2010.
   From 2008 to 2009, individual income taxes declined 20%, while
   corporate taxes declined 50%. At 15.1% of GDP, the 2009 and 2010
   collections were the lowest level of the past 50 years.^[10]^[11]

Tax policy[edit]

   Revenue and Expense as % GDP.

Tax descriptions[edit]

   The federal personal income tax is progressive, meaning a higher
   marginal tax rate is applied to higher ranges of income. For example,
   in 2010 the tax rate that applied to the first $17,000 in taxable
   income for a couple filing jointly was 10%, while the rate applied to
   income over $379,150 was 35%. The top marginal tax rate has declined
   considerably since 1980. For example, the top tax rate was lowered from
   70% to 50% in 1980 and reached as low as 28% in 1988. The Bush tax cuts
   of 2001 and 2003, extended by President Obama in 2010, lowered the top
   rate from 39.6% to 35%.^[12] The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
   raised the income tax rates for individuals earning over $400,000 and
   couples over $450,000. There are numerous exemptions and deductions,
   that typically result in a range of 35-40% of U.S. households owing no
   federal income tax. The recession and tax cut stimulus measures
   increased this to 51% for 2009, versus 38% in 2007.^[13]

   The federal payroll tax (FICA) which partially funds Social Security
   and Medicare was a flat tax until 2013. It is now a progressive tax.
   For the Social Security portion, employers and employees each pay 6.2%
   of the workers gross pay, a total of 12.4%. The Social Security portion
   is capped at $113,700 for 2013, meaning income above this amount is not
   subject to the tax. The Medicare portion is also paid by employer and
   employee each at 1.45% and is not capped. Starting in 2013, an
   additional 0.9 percent more in Medicare taxes was applied to income of
   more than $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly).^[14]
   For calendar years 2011 and 2012, the employee's portion of the payroll
   tax was reduced to 4.2% as an economic stimulus measure; this expired
   for 2013.^[15]

Tax expenditures[edit]

   The term "tax expenditures" refers to income exemptions or deductions
   that reduce the tax collections that would be made applying a
   particular tax rate alone. According to the Center for American
   Progress, annual tax expenditures have increased from $526 billion in
   1982 to $1,025 billion in 2010, adjusted for inflation (measured in
   2010 dollars).^[16] Economist Mark Zandi wrote in July 2011 that tax
   expenditures should be considered a form of government spending.^[17]

   In November 2009, The Economist estimated the additional federal tax
   revenue generated from eliminating certain tax expenditures, for the
   2013–2014 period. These included: income exemptions for
   employer-provided health insurance ($215 billion); and various income
   deductions such as mortgage interest ($147B), state & local taxes
   ($65B), capital gains on homes ($60B), property taxes ($33B) and
   municipal bond interest ($37B). This subset totals $557 billion.^[18]
   The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 2008 the
   amount of federal tax expenditures for the five year (2008–2012)
   period.^[19]

Major expenditure categories[edit]

   Main article: Expenditures in the United States federal budget
   CBO projections of U.S. Federal spending as % GDP 2014-2024

   During FY 2013, the federal government spent $3.5 trillion on a budget
   or cash basis, down $84 billion or 2.4% vs. FY 2012 spending of $3.54
   trillion. Major categories of FY 2013 spending included: Social
   Security ($803B or 23% of spending), Medicare & Medicaid ($760B or
   22%), Defense Department ($608B or 18%), and interest($259B or 7%).
   Healthcare and Social Security spending increased $81B (5.5%) versus
   2012, while Defense spending fell $47B (7.2%).^[9]

   Expenditures are classified as mandatory, with payments required by
   specific laws, or discretionary, with payment amounts renewed annually
   as part of the budget process. Expenditures averaged 20.4% GDP over the
   past 40 years, generally ranging +/-2% GDP from that level. The 2013
   spend was 20.8% GDP, versus 2012 spend of 22.0% GDP.^[9]

   CBO projects that spending for Social Security, Healthcare programs and
   interest costs will rise relative to GDP over the 2014-2024 period,
   while defense and other discretionary spending will decline relative to
   GDP.^[20]

Mandatory spending and social safety nets[edit]

   Social Security - Ratio of Covered Workers to Retirees
   Entitlement Spending Risks

   Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid expenditures are funded by more
   permanent Congressional appropriations and so are considered mandatory
   spending. Social Security and Medicare are sometimes called
   "entitlements," because people meeting relevant eligibility
   requirements are legally entitled to benefits, although most pay taxes
   into these programs throughout their working lives. Some programs, such
   as Food Stamps, are appropriated entitlements. Some mandatory spending,
   such as Congressional salaries, is not part of any entitlement program.
   Mandatory spending accounted for 57.4% of total federal outlays in
   FY2012, with net interest payments accounting for an additional 6.3%.
   In 2000, these were 53.2% and 12.5%, respectively.^[21]

   Mandatory spending is expected to continue increasing as a share of
   GDP. This is due in part to demographic trends, as the number of
   workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits. For
   example, the number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this
   declined to 3.0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2.2 by
   2030.^[22]^[23] These programs are also affected by per-person costs,
   which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than
   the economy. This unfavorable combination of demographics and
   per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and
   Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century. Unless these
   long-term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs,
   raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs, the federal
   government will at some point be unable to pay its obligations without
   significant risk to the value of the dollar (inflation).^[24]^[25]
     * Medicare was established in 1965 and expanded thereafter. Spending
       for Medicare during 2013 was $585 billion.^[26] In 2009, the
       program covered an estimated 45 million persons (38 million aged
       and 7 million disabled). It consists of four distinct parts which
       are funded differently: Hospital Insurance, mainly funded by a
       dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between
       employers and workers; Supplementary Medical Insurance, funded
       through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs
       for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount,
       approximately 75%); Medicare Advantage, a private plan option for
       beneficiaries, funded through the Hospital Insurance and
       Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds; and the "Part D"
       prescription drug benefits, for which funding is included in the
       Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund and is financed through
       beneficiary premiums (about 25%) and general revenues (about
       75%).^[27] Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow
       dramatically in coming decades. The number of persons enrolled in
       Medicare is expected to increase from 47 million in 2010 to 80
       million by 2030.^[28] While the same demographic trends that affect
       Social Security also affect Medicare, rapidly rising medical prices
       appear to be a more important cause of projected spending
       increases. CBO expects Medicare and Medicaid to continue growing,
       rising from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082.
       CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the
       primary long-term fiscal challenge.^[29] Various reform strategies
       were proposed for healthcare,^[30] and in March 2010, the Patient
       Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted as a means of health
       care reform. CBO reduced its per capita Medicare spending
       assumptions by $1,000 for 2014 and $2,300 for 2019, relative to its
       2010 estimate for those years.^[31] If this trend continues, it
       will significantly improve the long-term budget outlook.^[32]

   Note: CBO estimates that policy changes with a 0.6% of GDP annual
   impact are sufficient to address the 75-year program shortfall.

     * Social Security is a social insurance program officially called
       "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" (OASDI), in
       reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a
       dedicated payroll tax of 12.4%. During 2013, total benefits of $808
       billion were paid out versus $768 billion in 2012, an increase of
       $40 billion or 5.2%.^[26] Social Security’s total expenditures have
       exceeded its non-interest income since 2010. The deficit of
       non-interest income relative to cost was about $49 billion in 2010,
       $45 billion in 2011, and $55 billion in 2012.^[33] During 2010, an
       estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million
       received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary.^[34] Since
       the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, Social Security has
       cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the
       program than it has paid out to recipients—nearly $2.6 trillion in
       2010. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust
       funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. This
       surplus amount is commonly referred to as the "Social Security
       Trust Fund". The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where
       they may be used for other government purposes. Social Security
       spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due
       to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of
       program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010
       to 73 million in 2030.^[28] Program spending is projected to rise
       from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will
       stabilize.^[35] The Social Security Administration projects that an
       increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax
       base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security
       program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite
       time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base
       and 1.2% of GDP.^[36] Various reforms have been debated for Social
       Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living
       adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement
       age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax
       ($106,800 in 2009).^[37]^[38] Because of the mandatory nature of
       the program and large accumulated surplus in the Social Security
       Trust Fund, the Social Security system has the legal authority to
       compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits
       through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted.
       Thereafter, the program under current law will pay approximately
       75%–78% of promised benefits for the remainder of the
       century.^[34]^[39]

Discretionary spending[edit]

   Defense Spending 2001–2014.
   FY 2013 Estimated Federal Spending per 2013 Budget
     * Military spending: The military budget of the United States during
       FY 2012 was approximately $651 billion in expenses for the
       Department of Defense (DoD), $124 billion for the Department of
       Veterans Affairs, and $47 billion for the Department of Homeland
       Security, for a total of $822 billion. This was approximately $28
       billion or 3.3% below 2011 spending.^[40] The U.S. defense budget
       (excluding spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Homeland
       Security, and Veteran's Affairs) is around 4% of GDP. Adding these
       other costs places defense spending around 5% GDP. The DoD baseline
       budget, excluding supplemental funding for the wars, grew from $297
       billion in FY2001 to a budgeted $534 billion for FY2010, an 81%
       increase.^[41] According to the CBO, defense spending grew 9%
       annually on average from fiscal year 2000-2009.^[42] Much of the
       costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been funded
       through regular appropriations bills, but through emergency
       supplemental appropriations bills. As such, most of these expenses
       were not included in the budget deficit calculation prior to
       FY2010. Some budget experts argue that emergency supplemental
       appropriations bills do not receive the same level of legislative
       care as regular appropriations bills.^[43] During 2011, the U.S.
       spent more on its military budget than the next 13 countries
       combined.^[44]
     * Non-defense discretionary spending is used to fund the executive
       departments (e.g., the Department of Education) and independent
       agencies (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency), although
       these do receive a smaller amount of mandatory funding as well.
       Discretionary budget authority is established annually by Congress,
       as opposed to mandatory spending that is required by laws that span
       multiple years, such as Social Security or Medicare. The federal
       government spent approximately $615 billion during 2012 on the
       Cabinet Departments and Agencies, excluding the Department of
       Defense, representing 17% of budgeted expenditures or about 4.0% of
       GDP.^[21]

Interest expense[edit]

   CBO reported that net interest on the public debt was approximately
   $223 billion in FY2012 (6.3% of spending), down from $230 billion in
   FY2011.^[21] During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion,
   down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest
   expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the
   Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432
   billion. GAO reported that even though the national debt rose in
   FY2012, the interest rate paid declined.^[45] Should interest rates
   rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase
   dramatically. Historian Niall Ferguson described the risk that foreign
   investors would demand higher interest rates as the U.S. debt levels
   increase over time in a November 2009 interview.^[46] As of January
   2012, public debt owned by foreigners has increased to approximately
   50% of the total or approximately $5.0 trillion.^[47] As a result,
   nearly 50% of the interest payments are now leaving the country, which
   is different from past years when interest was paid to U.S. citizens
   holding the public debt. Interest expenses are projected to grow
   dramatically as the U.S. debt increases and interest rates rise from
   very low levels to more typical historical levels.^[48]

Understanding deficits and debt[edit]

   Deficit and Debt Increases 2001-2013.
   Main article: National debt of the United States

Relationship of deficit and debt[edit]

   Intuitively, the annual budget deficit should represent the amount
   added to the national debt.^[49] However, there are certain types of
   spending ("supplemental appropriations") outside the budget process
   which are not captured in the deficit computation, which also add to
   the national debt. Prior to 2009, spending for the wars in Iraq and
   Afghanistan was often funded through special appropriations excluded
   from the budget deficit calculation. In FY2010 and prior, the budget
   deficit and annual change in the national debt were significantly
   different. For example, the U.S. added $1 trillion to the national debt
   in FY2008 but reported a deficit of $455 billion. Due to rules changes
   implemented under President Obama in 2009, the two figures have moved
   closer together and were nearly identical in 2013.

Debt categories[edit]

   The total federal debt is divided into "debt held by the public" and
   "intra-governmental debt." The debt held by the public refers to U.S.
   government securities or other obligations held by investors (e.g.,
   bonds, bills and notes), while Social Security and other federal trust
   funds are part of the intra-governmental debt. As of September 30, 2012
   the total debt was $16.1 trillion, with debt held by the public of
   $11.3 trillion and intragovernmental debt of $4.8 trillion.^[50] Debt
   held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% in 2000 to
   40.3% in 2008 and 70.0% in 2012.^[51] U.S. GDP was approximately $15
   trillion during 2011 and an estimated $15.6 trillion for 2012 based on
   activity during the first two quarters.^[52] This means the total debt
   is roughly the size of GDP. Economists debate the level of debt
   relative to GDP that signals a "red line" or dangerous level, or if any
   such level exists.^[53] By comparison, China's budget deficit was 1.6%
   of its $10 trillion GDP in 2010, with a debt to GDP ratio of 16%.^[54]

Risks associated with the debt[edit]

   Total Debt $ and % to GDP 2000–2013

   The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt
   levels in a July 2010 publication:
     * A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of
       government debt, rather than investments in productive capital
       goods such as factories and leading to lower output and incomes
       than would otherwise occur;
     * Rising interest costs would force reductions in important
       government programs;
     * To the extent that additional tax revenues were generated by
       increasing marginal tax rates, those rates would discourage work
       and saving, further reducing output and incomes;
     * Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to
       respond to economic challenges; and
     * An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors
       demand higher interest rates.^[55]

   However, since mid to late 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining
   negative real interest rates at Treasury security auctions. At such low
   rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money according to one
   economist.^[56] There is no guarantee that such rates will continue,
   but the trend has remained falling or flat as of October 2012.^[57]

Government budget balance as a sectoral component[edit]

   Main article: Sectoral financial balances
   Sectoral financial balances in U.S. economy 1990-2012. By definition,
   the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the U.S. capital
   surplus and private sector surplus have driven a government budget
   deficit.

   Economist Martin Wolf explained in July 2012 that government fiscal
   balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the U.S.
   economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private
   financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these
   three sectors must be zero by definition. Since the foreign and private
   sectors are in surplus, the government sector must be in deficit.

   Wolf argued that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to
   surplus due to the global economic crisis forced the government balance
   into deficit, writing: "The financial balance of the private sector
   shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of
   11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of
   2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial
   deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No
   fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit
   between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The
   collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from
   financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to
   bust."^[58]

   Economist Paul Krugman also explained in December 2011 the causes of
   the sizable shift from private sector deficit to surplus: "This huge
   move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise
   in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of
   customers."^[59]

CBO budget projections[edit]

Short-term outlook[edit]

   CBO reported in its February 2014 Budget and Economic Outlook (which
   covers the 2014-2024 period) that deficits were projected to return to
   approximately the historical average relative to the size of the
   economy (GDP) by 2014. CBO estimated that under current law, the
   deficit would total $514 billion in fiscal year 2014 or 3.0% GDP.
   Deficits would then slowly begin rising again through 2024 due
   primarily to the pressures of an aging population and rising healthcare
   costs per person. The debt to GDP ratio would remain stable for much of
   the decade then begin rising again toward the end of the 10-year
   forecast window, from 74% in 2014 to 79% in 2024.^[1]

Long-term outlook[edit]

   CBO-Public Debt Under "Extended" and "Alternate" Scenarios
   Spending for mandatory programs is projected to rise relative to GDP,
   while discretionary programs decline

   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports its Long-Term Budget
   Outlook annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending,
   revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2014 Outlook mainly covers the 25 year
   period through 2039.

   The "extended baseline scenario" assumes that the laws currently on the
   books will be implemented, for the most part. CBO reported in July 2014
   that under this scenario: "If current laws remained generally unchanged
   in the future, federal debt held by the public would decline slightly
   relative to GDP over the next few years. After that, however, growing
   budget deficits would push debt back to and above its current high
   level. Twenty-five years from now, in 2039, federal debt held by the
   public would exceed 100 percent of GDP. Moreover, debt would be on an
   upward path relative to the size of the economy, a trend that could not
   be sustained indefinitely. By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5 percent
   of GDP, larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and federal debt
   held by the public would reach 106 percent of GDP, more than in any
   year except 1946—even without factoring in the economic effects of
   growing debt."^[8]

   The "extended alternative fiscal scenario" assumes the continuation of
   present trends, which result in a more unfavorable debt position and
   adverse economic consequences relative to the baseline scenario. CBO
   reported in July 2014 that under this scenario: "[C]ertain policies
   that are now in place but are scheduled to change under current law are
   assumed to continue, and some provisions of current law that might be
   difficult to sustain for a long period are assumed to be modified.
   Under that scenario, deficits excluding interest payments would be
   about $2 trillion larger over the first decade than those under the
   baseline; subsequently, such deficits would be larger than those under
   the extended baseline by rapidly increasing amounts, doubling as a
   percentage of GDP in less than 10 years. CBO projects that real GNP in
   2039 would be about 5 percent lower under the extended alternative
   fiscal scenario than under the extended baseline with economic
   feedback, and that interest rates would be about three-quarters of a
   percentage point higher. Reflecting the budgetary effects of those
   economic developments, federal debt would rise to 183 percent of GDP in
   2039."^[8]

   Over the long-term, CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory
   spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will
   continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g.,
   Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to
   GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the
   above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios
   that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio
   down.^[8]

   CBO estimated under the baseline scenario that the U.S. debt held by
   the public would increase approximately $8.5 trillion between the end
   of 2014 and 2024. Under a $2 trillion deficit reduction scenario during
   that first decade, federal debt held by the public in 2039 would stand
   at 75 percent of GDP, only slightly above the value of 72 percent at
   the end of 2013. Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for
   that decade, federal debt held by the public would fall to 42 percent
   of GDP in 2039. By comparison, such debt was 35 percent of GDP in 2007
   and has averaged 39 percent of GDP during the past 40 years.^[8]

   CBO reported in September 2011: "The nation cannot continue to sustain
   the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it
   has been accustomed to paying. Citizens will either have to pay more
   for their government, accept less in government services and benefits,
   or both."^[60]

Contemporary issues and debates[edit]

   Main articles: Political debates about the United States federal budget
   and Deficit reduction in the United States
   See also: Social Security debate in the United States and Health care
   reform debate in the United States

   Topics frequently in the news in the 2010-2012 time period included: a)
   the austerity versus stimulus debate; b) the fiscal cliff including the
   effects of the Bush tax cuts and related extension; c) causes of
   deficit and debt increases; and d) the effects of healthcare reform on
   the budget.

Conceptual arguments[edit]

   Many of the debates surrounding the United States federal budget center
   around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general,
   Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage
   economic growth via a mixed economy of both private and public
   enterprise, a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight.
   Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of
   either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via
   small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free
   enterprise.^[61]^[62] Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and
   role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These
   debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality and
   intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt
   today may or may not enhance the quality of life for future
   generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation
   burden.^[63]

   Political realities make major budgetary deals difficult to achieve.
   While Republicans argue conceptually for reductions in Medicare and
   Social Security, they are hesitant to actually vote to reduce the
   benefits from these popular programs. Democrats on the other hand argue
   conceptually for tax increases on the wealthy, yet may be hesitant to
   vote for them because of the effect on campaign donations from the
   wealthy. The so-called budgetary "grand bargain" of tax hikes on the
   rich and removal of some popular tax deductions in exchange for
   reductions to Medicare and Social Security is therefore elusive.^[64]

   Economic growth and employment are key factors driving recent deficits.
   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in October 2011 that
   approximately one-third of the deficit projected for fiscal year 2012
   was due to economic factors, which have caused safety net expenditures
   to increase and tax revenues to decline with high unemployment.^[65]

Austerity vs. stimulus[edit]

   One of the debates facing the U.S. and Europe during 2012 relates to
   choices between deficit reduction ("austerity") and running larger
   budget deficits (via higher spending and tax cuts) to encourage
   economic growth and employment. Several European countries that
   implemented austerity policies via government cost reductions and
   higher taxes during 2010-2011 have initially experienced slowing
   economies, as predicted by Keynesian economics.^[66]^[67]

   Economists Lawrence Summers and Christina D. Romer wrote in April 2012
   that larger budget deficits today to stimulate the economy can be
   coupled with austerity measures that phase in gradually.^[68]^[69] For
   example, laws could be passed today funding investments in
   infrastructure to stimulate the economy today while raising the
   retirement age and raising taxes over time. Former OMB Director Peter
   Orszag wrote in May 2012: "When policy makers put in place measures
   carefully designed to reduce the federal deficit in the future, most of
   them happen...enacting more stimulus today and more deficit reduction
   to take effect later is exactly what the U.S. needs."^[70]

   Economists Joseph Stiglitz and Mark Zandi both advocated significant
   mortgage refinancing or write-downs during August 2012 to help provide
   an economic boost, as over 13 million homeowners are underwater on
   their homes, which affects their ability to consume.^[71] Economist
   Amir Sufi at the University of Chicago argued in July 2011 that a high
   level of household debt is a major factor holding back the economy. His
   research indicates that areas of the country with lower household debt
   levels have recovered more quickly from the economic downturn. He
   advocates mortgage write-downs and other debt reduction ideas.^[72]

   Economist Raghuram Rajan wrote in May 2012 that the U.S. economy was
   not on a sustainable path pre-crisis and that fiscal and monetary
   stimulus may not be effective solutions. More long-term measures will
   be required to make workers more competitive: "Sensible policy lies in
   improving the capabilities of the workforce across the country, so that
   they can get sustainable jobs with steady incomes." He also advocated
   mortgage principal reduction to relieve household debt burdens.^[73]

   Economist Michael Spence analyzed U.S. employment trends from 1990 to
   2008, separating workforce components into internationally tradable and
   non-tradable industries. Nearly all job growth from 1990 to 2008 was in
   the non-tradable industries. These trends are correlated with
   increasing income inequality and indicate significant structural issues
   face the U.S. labor market.^[74]

   Economist Paul Krugman argued in December 2012 that there is no
   short-run fiscal crisis and the emphasis should be on job creation. He
   warns that a well-financed lobby of "deficit scolds" have created a
   phony deficit crisis when the government should be spending more to put
   people to work. He pointed out that the U.S. cannot default because it
   can print money and that interest rates on government debt are very
   low, allowing the government to borrow easily. The main risk of fiscal
   profligacy would be inflation, which might actually help as a devalued
   dollar would make exports more competitive.^[75]^[76]

The "fiscal cliff" and "sequester"[edit]

   Main articles: United States fiscal cliff and 2013 Sequestration
   U.S. Federal budget deficit as % GDP assuming continuation of certain
   policies 2011-2021.

   The CBO estimated that letting current laws take effect beyond 2012
   would significantly reduce future budget deficits. For example, the
   Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 (extended by President Obama in 2010)
   were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. Other deficit reducers per
   the CBO include: allowing the automatic spending cuts in the Budget
   Control Act of 2011 to take effect, allowing other tax cuts enacted in
   2009 and 2010 by President Obama to expire in 2012, allowing the
   alternative minimum tax (AMT) to affect more taxpayers, and reducing
   Medicare reimbursements to doctors. These and other current laws, if
   allowed to take effect, reduce the deficit from an estimated 4.7% GDP
   in 2021 to 1.2% GDP.^[77] Total deficit reduction could be as high as
   $7.1 trillion over a decade if current law is enforced and not
   overridden.^[78]

   The significant impact of the multiple tax cut expirations and spending
   reductions that take effect at the end of calendar year 2012 were
   referred to as the "fiscal cliff."^[79] The CBO estimated in May 2012
   that allowing current law to take effect would reduce the deficit by a
   net $560 billion in 2013, roughly half the $1.2 trillion 2011 deficit.
   Real GDP growth in 2013 would be reduced to 0.5% versus 1.1%, with a
   high probability of recession during the first half of the year (a 1.3%
   GDP contraction) followed by 2.3% growth in the second half. Over the
   long-run, lower deficits and debt support relatively higher growth
   estimates, however.^[80]^[81] The fiscal cliff was addressed by the
   American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

Causes of change[edit]

   Cause of change between CBO's 2001 projection of a $5.6 trillion
   surplus between 2002-2012 and the $6.1 trillion debt increase that
   actually occurred.

   The U.S. last balanced its budget in 2001, with a 1.3% GDP surplus.
   Between 2001 and 2012, spending increased by 4.5% GDP (from 18.2% GDP
   in 2001 to 22.7% GDP in 2012), while revenues declined by 3.7% GDP
   (from 19.5% GDP in 2001 to 15.8% GDP in 2012), resulting in a 7.0% GDP
   deficit for 2012. Medicare/Medicaid spending increased by 1.6% GDP and
   defense spending increased by 1.3% GDP from 2001 to 2012. Individual
   income tax revenues fell by 2.4% GDP and payroll taxes fell by 1.4% GDP
   from 2001 to 2012.^[82]

   Economist Paul Krugman summarized the causes of increasing deficits and
   debt in May 2011: "What happened to the budget surplus the federal
   government had in 2000? The answer is, three main things. First, there
   were the Bush tax cuts, which added roughly $2 trillion to the national
   debt over the last decade. Second, there were the wars in Iraq and
   Afghanistan, which added an additional $1.1 trillion or so. And third
   was the Great Recession, which led both to a collapse in revenue and to
   a sharp rise in spending on unemployment insurance and other safety-net
   programs."^[83]^[84]

   In June 2012, CBO summarized the cause of change between its January
   2001 estimate of a $5.6 trillion cumulative surplus between 2002 and
   2011 and the actual $6.1 trillion cumulative deficit that occurred, an
   unfavorable "turnaround" or debt increase of $11.7 trillion. Tax cuts
   and slower-than-expected growth reduced revenues by $6.1 trillion and
   spending was $5.6 trillion higher. Of this total, the CBO attributes
   72% to legislated tax cuts and spending increases and 27% to economic
   and technical factors. Of the latter, 56% occurred from 2009 to
   2011.^[85]^[86]

   The difference between the projected and actual debt in 2011 can be
   largely attributed to:
     * $3.5 trillion – Economic changes (including lower than expected tax
       revenues and higher safety net spending due to recession)
     * $1.6 trillion – Bush Tax Cuts (EGTRRA and JGTRRA), primarily tax
       cuts but also some smaller spending increases
     * $1.5 trillion – Increased defense and non-defense discretionary
       spending
     * $1.4 trillion – Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
     * $1.4 trillion – Incremental interest due to higher debt balances
     * $0.9 trillion – Obama stimulus and tax cuts (ARRA and Tax Act of
       2010)^[86]

   Several other sources have used CBO data to summarize the results in
   various ways.^[87]^[88]^[89]

   Economist Martin Wolf explained in July 2012 that when the U.S. economy
   has a foreign financial surplus (due to its trade deficit) and a
   private sector financial surplus (because household savings exceeds
   business investment), the government must run a budget deficit. This is
   a rule that holds true by definition. He wrote: "The idea that the huge
   fiscal deficits of recent years have been the result of decisions taken
   by the current administration is nonsense. No fiscal policy changes
   explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009,
   because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by
   the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into
   surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust."^[90] Economist Paul
   Krugman also explained in December 2011 the significant shift in the
   private sector from deficit to surplus.^[59]

Healthcare reform[edit]

   CBO estimated in March 2011 that the Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act (PPACA), the controversial healthcare legislation passed in
   2010 also known as "Obamacare," is expected to reduce the deficit $210
   billion total between 2012-2021, with revenues of $813 billion
   partially offset by outlays of $604 billion.^[91] CBO updated its
   estimate in July 2012, indicating a repeal of PPACA would add $109
   billion to the deficit between 2013-2022.^[92]

   CBO estimates that PPACA includes reductions in Medicare of over $700
   billion during the 2013-2022 period, mainly through slightly reducing
   the trajectory of spending increases expected prior to PPACA.
   Individual beneficiaries are not directly impacted; most of the cost
   savings comes from reducing future payments to hospitals and other
   service providers relative to previous baseline estimates. In other
   words, PPACA "bends the curve" on Medicare costs down
   somewhat.^[93]^[94] Further, since PPACA reduces Medicare payouts, the
   position of the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is
   significantly improved. PPACA extended the life of the Medicare HI
   Trust Fund by 8 years and reduced the 75-year annual shortfall from
   3.88% of the U.S. payroll tax base to 1.35%.^[95]

Spending out of proportion to threats[edit]

   The U.S. federal budget has been criticized for spending on research
   and action on harm reduction out of proportion to the magnitude of the
   underlying threats. For example, heart disease, cancer, strokes,
   respiratory diseases, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease claimed about
   1,650,000 American lives in 2007, when the government spent about $9.6
   billion researching ways to alleviate those illnesses. In contrast,
   terrorism had claimed about 300 lives per year on average over the
   previous decade, but $150 billion was spent to prevent terrorism, not
   including even more costly defense and war expenses.^[96] However, a
   major terrorist attack could cause substantial economic disruption. The
   September 11, 2001 attacks killed almost 3000 people, but caused
   extensive economic disruption including about $40 billion in insurance
   losses, a stock market drop which took months to recover, about $15
   billion in assistance to airlines, substantial tourism losses, and
   430,000 lost jobs amounting to $2.8 billion in lost wages over the
   three months following.

Proposed deficit reduction[edit]

   Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and
   Reform-Public Debt as % GDP Under Various Scenarios
   Main article: Deficit reduction in the United States

Strategies[edit]

   There are a variety of proposed strategies for reducing the federal
   deficit. These may include policy choices regarding taxation and
   spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and
   reduce unemployment. For example, a fast-growing economy offers the
   win-win outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie, with higher
   employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower
   debt-to-GDP ratio. However, most other strategies represent a tradeoff
   scenario in which money or benefits are taken from some and given to
   others. Spending can be reduced from current levels, frozen, or the
   rate of future spending increases reduced. Budgetary rules can also be
   implemented to manage spending. Some changes can take place today,
   while others can phase in over time. Although a still-weak economy
   limits the scope for large adjustments immediately, addressing the
   long-term imbalance soon will allow for more reasonable and gradual
   adjustments.^[97] Tax revenues can be raised in a variety of ways, by
   raising tax rates, the scope of what is taxed, or eliminating
   deductions and exemptions ("tax expenditures"). Regulatory uncertainty
   or barriers can be reduced, as these may cause businesses to postpone
   investment and hiring decisions.^[98]

   The CBO reported in September 2011 that: "Given the aging of the
   population and rising costs for health care, attaining a sustainable
   federal budget will require the United States to deviate from the
   policies of the past 40 years in at least one of the following ways:
     * Raise federal revenues significantly above their average share of
       GDP;
     * Make major changes to the sorts of benefits provided for Americans
       when they become older; or
     * Substantially reduce the role of the rest of the federal government
       relative to the size of the economy."^[99]

   During June 2012, Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke recommended three
   objectives for fiscal policy: 1) Take steps to put the federal budget
   on a sustainable fiscal path; 2) Avoid unnecessarily impeding the
   ongoing economic recovery; and 3) Design tax policies and spending
   programs to promote a stronger economy.^[100]

   President Barack Obama stated in June 2012: "What I’ve said is, let’s
   make long-term spending cuts; let’s initiate long-term reforms; let’s
   reduce our health care spending; let’s make sure that we’ve got a
   pathway, a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, but at the same time,
   let’s not under-invest in the things that we need to do right now to
   grow. And that recipe of short-term investments in growth and jobs with
   a long-term path of fiscal responsibility is the right approach to take
   for, I think, not only the United States but also for Europe."^[101]

Specific proposals[edit]

   A variety of government task forces, expert panels, private
   institutions, politicians, and journalists have made recommendations
   for reducing the deficit and slowing the growth of debt. Several
   organizations have compared the future impact of these plans on the
   deficit, debt, and economy. One helpful way of measuring the impact of
   the plans is to compare them in terms of revenue and expense as a
   percentage of GDP over time, in total and by category. This helps
   illustrate how the different plan authors have prioritized particular
   elements of the budget.^[102]

Government commission proposals[edit]

     * President Obama established a budget reform commission, the
       National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform which
       released a draft report in December 2010. The proposal is sometimes
       called the "Bowles-Simpson" plan after the co-chairs of the
       Commission. It included various tax and spending adjustments to
       bring long-run government tax revenue and spending into line at
       approximately 21% of GDP, with $4 trillion debt avoidance over 10
       years. Under 2011 policies, the national debt would increase
       approximately $10 trillion over the 2012-2021 period, so this $4
       trillion avoidance reduces the projected debt increase to $6
       trillion.^[103] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analyzed
       the plan and compared it to other plans in October 2012.^[104]

President Obama's proposals[edit]

     * President Obama announced a 10-year (2012–2021) plan in September
       2011 called: "Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future:
       The President’s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction."
       The plan included tax increases on the wealthy, along with cuts in
       future spending on defense and Medicare. Social Security was
       excluded from the plan. The plan included a net debt avoidance of
       $3.2 trillion over 10 years. If the Budget Control Act of 2011 is
       included, this adds another $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction for
       a total of $4.4 trillion.^[105] The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC)
       evaluated the President's 2012 budget against several alternate
       proposals, reporting it had revenues relative to GDP similar to the
       Domenici-Rivlin and Bowles-Simpson expert panel recommendations but
       slightly higher spending.^[102]
     * President Obama proposed during July 2012 allowing the Bush tax
       cuts to expire for individual taxpayers earning over $200,000 and
       couples earning over $250,000, which represents the top 2% of
       income earners. Reverting to Clinton-era tax rates for these
       taxpayers would mean increases in the top rates to 36% and 39.6%
       from 33% and 35%. This would raise approximately $850 billion in
       revenue over a decade. It would also mean raising the tax rate on
       investment income, which is highly concentrated among the wealthy,
       to 20% from 15%.^[106]

Congressional proposals[edit]

     * The House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, chaired by
       Rep. Paul Ryan (R), released The Path to Prosperity: Restoring
       America's Promise and a 2012 budget. The Path focuses on tax reform
       (lowering income tax rates and reducing tax expenditures or
       loopholes); spending cuts and controls; and redesign of the
       Medicare and Medicaid programs. It does not propose significant
       changes to Social Security.^[107] The Bipartisan Policy Center
       (BPC) evaluated the 2012 Republican budget proposal, noting it had
       the lowest spending and tax revenue relative to GDP among several
       alternatives.^[108]
     * The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) proposed "The People's
       Budget" in April 2011, which it claimed would balance the budget by
       2021 while maintaining debt as a % GDP under 65%. It proposed
       reversing most of the Bush tax cuts; higher income tax rates on the
       wealthy and restoring the estate tax, investing in a jobs program,
       and reducing defense spending.^[109] The BPC evaluated the
       proposal, noting it had both the highest spending and tax revenue
       relative to GDP among several alternatives.^[110] The CPC also
       proposed a 2014 budget called "Back to Work." It included
       short-term stimulus, defense spending cuts, and tax
       increases.^[111]
     * Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Steven LaTourette (R-OH) proposed
       a budget in the House of Representatives in March 2012. While it
       did not pass the House, it received bi-partisan support, with 17
       votes in favor from each party. According to the BPC: "...the plan
       would enact tax reform by lowering both the corporate and
       individual income tax rates and raising revenue by broadening the
       base. Policies are endorsed that improve the health of the Social
       Security program, restrain health care cost growth, control
       annually appropriated spending, and make cuts to other entitlement
       programs." The plan proposes to raise approximately $1 trillion
       less revenue over the 2013-2022 decade than the Simpson-Bowles and
       Domenici-Rivlin plans, while cutting non-defense discretionary
       spending more deeply and reducing the defense spending cuts
       mandated in the Budget Control Act of 2011.^[112] According to the
       Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this plan is ideologically
       to the Right of either the Simpson-Bowles or Domenici-Rivlin
       plans.^[113]
     * In May 2012, House Republicans put forward five separate budget
       proposals for a vote in the Senate. The Republican proposals
       included the House-approved proposal by House Budget Chairman Paul
       Ryan and one that was very close in content to the budget proposal
       submitted earlier in 2012 by President Barack Obama.^[114] The
       other three proposals each called for greatly reduced government
       spending. The budget put forward by Senator Mike Lee would halve
       the government over the next 25 years. Senator Rand Paul's budget
       included proposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security benefits and
       the closure of four Cabinet departments. The budget plan from
       Senator Patrick Toomey aimed to balance the budget within eight
       years. All five of the proposed plans were rejected in the
       Senate.^[115]^[116]

Private expert panel proposals[edit]

     * The Peter G. Peterson Foundation solicited proposals from six
       organizations, which included the American Enterprise Institute,
       the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Center for American Progress, the
       Economic Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the
       Roosevelt Institute Campus Network. The recommendations of each
       group were reported in May 2011.^[117]
     * The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) sponsored a Debt Reduction Task
       Force, co-chaired by Pete V. Domenici and Alice M. Rivlin. The
       Domenici-Rivlin panel created a report called "Restoring America's
       Future," which was published in November 2010. The plan claimed to
       stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at 60%, with up to $6 trillion in
       debt avoidance over the 2011-2020 period. Specific plan elements
       included defense and non-defense spending freezes for 4–5 years,
       income tax reform, elimination of tax expenditures, and a national
       sales tax or value-added tax (VAT).^[118]^[119]
     * The Hamilton Project published a guidebook with 15 different
       proposals from various policy and budget experts in February, 2013.
       The authors were asked to provide pragmatic, evidenced-based
       proposals that would both reduce the deficit and bring broader
       economic benefits. Proposals included a value added tax and
       reductions to tax expenditures, among others.^[120]

Timing of solutions[edit]

   There is significant debate regarding the urgency of addressing the
   short-term and long-term budget challenges. Prior to the 2008-2009 U.S.
   recession, experts argued for steps to be put in place immediately to
   address an unsustainable trajectory of federal deficits. For example,
   Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in January 2007: "The longer we wait, the
   more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the objectives are
   going to be. I think the right time to start was about 10 years
   ago."^[121]

   However, experts after the 2008-2009 U.S. recession argued that
   longer-term austerity measures should not interfere with measures to
   address the short-term economic challenges of high unemployment and
   slow growth. Ben Bernanke wrote in September 2011: "...the two
   goals--achieving fiscal sustainability, which is the result of
   responsible policies set in place for the longer term, and avoiding
   creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery--are not incompatible.
   Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits
   over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal
   choices for the recovery in the near term, can help serve both
   objectives."^[122]

   IMF managing director Christine Lagarde wrote in August 2011: "For the
   advanced economies, there is an unmistakable need to restore fiscal
   sustainability through credible consolidation [deficit reduction]
   plans. At the same time we know that slamming on the brakes too quickly
   will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects. So fiscal adjustment
   must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow.
   Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is
   needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term
   support for growth and jobs. That may sound contradictory, but the two
   are mutually reinforcing. Decisions on future consolidation, tackling
   the issues that will bring sustained fiscal improvement, create space
   in the near term for policies that support growth and jobs."^[123]

       by President Clinton)
     * 1996 United States federal budget – $1.6 trillion (submitted 1995
       by President Clinton)

   The budget year runs from October 1 to September 30 the following year
   and is submitted by the President to Congress prior to October for the
   following year. In this way the budget of 2013 is submitted before the
   end of September 2012. This means that the budget of 2001 was submitted
   by Bill Clinton and was in force during most of George W. Bush's first
   year in office. The budget submitted by George W. Bush in his last year
   in office was the budget of 2009, which was in force through most of
   Barack Obama's first year in office.

   The President's budget also contains revenue and spending projections
   for the current fiscal year, the coming fiscal years, as well as
   several future fiscal years. In recent years, the President's budget
   contained projections five years into the future. The Congressional
   Budget Office (CBO) issues a "Budget and Economic Outlook" each January
   and an analysis of the President's budget each March. CBO also issues
   an updated budget and economic outlook in August.

   Actual budget data for prior years is available from the Congressional
   Budget Office; see the "Historical Budget Data" links on the main page
   of the "The Budget and Economic Outlook."^[125] and from the Office of
   Management and Budget (OMB).^[126]
