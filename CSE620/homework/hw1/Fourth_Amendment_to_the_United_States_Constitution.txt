   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives

   The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution
   is the part of the Bill of Rights that prohibits unreasonable searches
   and seizures and requires any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and
   supported by probable cause. It was adopted in response to the abuse of
   the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the
   British government and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary
   America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by
   James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights,
   in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution.
   Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789.
   By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had
   ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson
   announced the adoption of the amendment.

   Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states, and
   federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century
   of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the
   Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to
   apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio (1961).

   Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure (including arrest)
   should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied
   to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has
   sworn by it. Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central
   questions: what government activities constitute "search" and
   "seizure"; what constitutes probable cause for these actions; and how
   violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. Early court
   decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's
   physical intrusion onto private property, but with Katz v. United
   States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the
   warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals as well as
   physical locations. Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most
   search and seizure activities, but the Court has defined a series of
   exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence in
   plain view, exigent circumstances, border searches, and other
   situations.

   The exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced. Established
   in Weeks v. United States (1914), this rule holds that evidence
   obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible
   at criminal trials. Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal
   search may also be inadmissible as "fruit of the poisonous tree,"
   unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means.

     The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
     papers, and effects,^[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures,
     shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
     probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
     describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
     seized.^[2]

Background

English law

   Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden established the English common law
   precedent against general search warrants.

   Like many other areas of American law, the Fourth Amendment finds its
   roots in English legal doctrine. Sir Edward Coke, in Semayne's case
   (1604), famously stated: "The house of every one is to him as his
   castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and
   violence as for his repose."^[3] Semayne's Case acknowledged that the
   King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects'
   dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to
   conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their
   purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained.^[4]

   The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state
   officers, who, using general warrants, conducted raids in search of
   materials relating to John Wilkes's publications attacking both
   government policies and the King himself. The most famous of these
   cases involved John Entick, whose home was forcibly entered by the
   King's Messenger Nathan Carrington, along with others, pursuant to a
   warrant issued by George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing
   them "to make strict and diligent search for ... the author, or one
   concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers
   intitled, 'The Monitor or British Freeholder, No 257, 357, 358, 360,
   373, 376, 378, and 380,'" and seized printed charts, pamphlets and
   other materials. Entick filed suit in Entick v Carrington, argued
   before the Court of King's Bench in 1765. Charles Pratt, 1st Earl
   Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure was unlawful, as the
   warrant authorized the seizure of all of Entick's papers—not just the
   criminal ones—and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify
   the search. By holding that "[O]ur law holds the property of every man
   so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close
   without his leave",^[5] Entick established the English precedent that
   the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common
   law.^[4]

Colonial America

   Homes in Colonial America, on the other hand, did not enjoy the same
   sanctity as their British counterparts, because legislation had been
   explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British
   revenue-gathering policies on customs; until 1750, in fact, the only
   type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was
   the general warrant.^[4] During what scholar William Cuddihy called the
   "colonial epidemic of general searches", the authorities possessed
   almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time, with very
   little oversight.^[6]
   Massachusetts lawyer James Otis protested British use of general
   warrants in the American colonies.

   In 1756, the colony of Massachusetts enacted legislation that barred
   the use of general warrants. This represented the first law in American
   history curtailing the use of seizure power. Its creation largely
   stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754, which
   gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists
   concerning their use of goods subject to customs. The act also
   permitted the use of a general warrant known as a writ of assistance,
   allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize
   "prohibited and uncustomed" goods.^[7]

   A crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27, 1760 when
   the news of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All
   writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King and
   would have had to be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain
   valid.^[8]

   In mid-January 1761, a group of over 50 merchants represented by James
   Otis petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue. During the
   five-hour hearing on February 23, 1761, Otis vehemently denounced
   British colonial policies, including their sanction of general warrants
   and writs of assistance.^[9] Future US President John Adams, who was
   present in the courtroom when Otis spoke, viewed these events as "the
   spark in which originated the American Revolution."^[10] However, the
   court ruled against Otis.^[11]

   Because of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs,
   Otis was elected to the Massachusetts colonial legislature and helped
   pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be "granted
   by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any
   officer of the customs" and barring all other writs. The governor
   overturned the legislation, finding it contrary to English law and
   parliamentary sovereignty.^[12]

   Seeing the danger general warrants presented, the Virginia Declaration
   of Rights (1776) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants. This
   prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment:^[13]

     That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be
     commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact
     committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose
     offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are
     grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.^[13]

   Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, written by John
   Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution,
   added the requirement that all searches must be "reasonable" and served
   as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment:^[14]

     Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable
     searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and
     all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this
     right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously
     supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to
     a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest
     one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not
     accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of
     search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in
     cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.^[15]

   By 1784, eight state constitutions contained a provision against
   general warrants.^[16]

Proposal and ratification

   Main article: United States Bill of Rights

   After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles
   of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed
   a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief
   executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention
   delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed
   that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be
   included. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights drafter James
   Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil
   liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual
   rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were
   unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a
   unanimous vote of the state delegations.^[17]

   For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen
   states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to
   ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's
   lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the
   Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification
   (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed
   that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for
   the addition of a bill of rights.^[18] Four state conventions proposed
   some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government
   to conduct searches.^[16]
   James Madison, drafter of the Bill of Rights

   In the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures'
   request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based
   on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights
   1689, including an amendment requiring probable cause for government
   searches. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to
   twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on
   September 25, 1789.^[19]

   By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for
   ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists,
   who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as
   a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism.
   Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the
   Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second
   constitutional convention, which they desired.^[20] Anti-Federalists
   such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most
   objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal
   judiciary and direct taxation, intact.^[21]

   On November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve
   amendments, including the Fourth. On December 19, 1789, December 22,
   1789, and January 19, 1790, respectively, Maryland, North Carolina, and
   South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments.^[22] On January 25 and
   28, 1790, respectively, New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of
   the Bill's twelve amendments, including the Fourth.^[22] This brought
   the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the
   process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill
   of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts
   ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to
   the Secretary of State that it had done so. (All three states would
   later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in
   1939.)^[21]

   In February through June of 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode
   Island each ratified eleven of the amendments, including the Fourth.
   Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted
   to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for
   ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791,
   approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on
   December 15, 1791.^[21] Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced
   the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1,
   1792.^[23]

Applicability

   The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the federal government,
   and went through a long initial phase of "judicial dormancy";^[24] in
   the words of historian Gordon S. Wood, "After ratification, most
   Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the
   Constitution."^[25] Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was
   narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and
   Sherman Antitrust Act were passed. As federal criminal jurisdiction
   expanded to include other areas such as narcotics, more questions about
   the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court.^[26] The U.S. Supreme
   Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose
   of the amendment as guaranteeing "the privacy, dignity and security of
   persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the
   Government, without regard to whether the government actor is
   investigating crime or performing another function."^[27] In Mapp v.
   Ohio (1961),^[28] the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth
   Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the
   Fourteenth Amendment.^[29]

   Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues: what
   government activities constitute "search" and "seizure"; what
   constitutes probable cause for these actions; how violations of Fourth
   Amendment rights should be addressed.^[30]

   The Fourth Amendment typically requires "a neutral and detached
   authority interposed between the police and the public," and it is
   offended by "general warrants" and laws that allows searches to be
   conducted "indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with
   [a] crime under investigation.",^[31] for the "basic purpose of the
   Fourth Amendment, which is enforceable against the States through the
   Fourteenth, through its prohibition of "unreasonable" searches and
   seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals
   against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials."^[32]

   The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest
   generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant, because the basic
   rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and "searches conducted
   outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or
   magistrate, are per se unreasonable."^[33] In order for such a warrant
   to be considered reasonable, it must be supported by probable cause and
   be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a
   person (usually a law enforcement officer) who has sworn by it and is
   therefore accountable to the issuing court. The Supreme Court further
   held in Chandler v. Miller (1997): "To be reasonable under the Fourth
   Amendment, a search ordinarily must be based on individualized
   suspicion of wrongdoing. But particularized exceptions to the main rule
   are sometimes warranted based on 'special needs, beyond the normal need
   for law enforcement.' ... When such 'special needs' are alleged, courts
   must undertake a context-specific inquiry, examining closely the
   competing private and public interests advanced by the parties."^[34]
   The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures, but not
   those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on
   behalf of a government.^[35] In Ontario v. Quon (2010), the Court held
   the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an
   employer, ruling that a government could search a police officer's text
   messages that were sent over that government's pager.^[27]^[36]

Search

   Potter Stewart wrote the majority decision in Katz v. United States,
   which expanded Fourth Amendment protections to electronic surveillance.

   One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether
   a "search" has occurred. Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a
   citizen's property rights—that is, when the government physically
   intrudes on "persons, houses, papers, or effects" for the purpose of
   obtaining information, a "search" within the original meaning of the
   Fourth Amendment has occurred. Early 20th-century Court decisions, such
   as Olmstead v. United States (1928), held that Fourth Amendment rights
   applied in cases of physical intrusion, but not to other forms of
   police surveillance (e.g., wiretaps).^[37] In Silverman v. United
   States (1961), the Court stated of the amendment that "at the very core
   stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be
   free from unreasonable governmental intrusion."^[38]

   Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United
   States (1967).^[37]^[39] In Katz, the Supreme Court expanded that focus
   to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and ruled that a search
   had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a
   microphone attached to the outside of the glass. While there was no
   physical intrusion into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by
   entering the booth and shutting the door behind him, had exhibited his
   expectation that "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be
   broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation
   was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion
   that "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places".^[40] A
   "search" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the
   government violates a person's "reasonable expectation of
   privacy."^[41] Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided
   the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic
   rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and
   thus necessitated a warrant.^[37]^[42] The Court said that it was not
   recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment,^[43]
   and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures
   had been followed.^[42]

   This decision in Katz was later developed into the now commonly used
   two-prong test, adopted in Smith v. Maryland (1979),^[44] for
   determining whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable in a given
   circumstance:^[45]^[46]
    1. a person "has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of
       privacy"; and
    2. society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is
       (objectively) reasonable.

   An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information
   provided to third parties.^[44]^[47] In Smith, the Supreme Court held
   individuals have no "legitimate expectation of privacy" regarding the
   telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that
   information to telephone companies when they dial a number.^[48]

   Following Katz, the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have
   turned on the right to privacy, but in United States v. Jones (2012),
   the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case
   law, but rather, has supplemented it.^[49] In Jones, law enforcement
   officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones'
   knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to
   the car, and so had a property interest in the car.^[50] Therefore,
   since the intrusion on the vehicle—a common law trespass—was for the
   purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search
   under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar "trespass" reasoning
   in Florida v. Jardines (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection
   dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search.^[51]

   In certain situations, law enforcement may perform a search when they
   have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls
   short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under Terry v. Ohio
   (1968), law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited
   warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause
   under certain circumstances. In Terry, the Supreme Court ruled that
   when a police officer witnesses "unusual conduct" that leads that
   officer to reasonably believe "that criminal activity may be afoot",
   that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is
   presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a
   "pat-down search" (or "frisk") to determine whether the person is
   carrying a weapon.^[52] This detention and search is known as a Terry
   stop. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific
   and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences
   from those facts, reasonably warrant their actions.^[53] As established
   in Florida v. Royer (1983), such a search must be temporary, and
   questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers
   who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe
   that the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming that
   it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions about anything
   else, such as the possession of contraband).^[54]^[55]

Seizure

   The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person,
   person's home (including its curtilage) or personal property without a
   warrant. A seizure of property occurs when there is "some meaningful
   interference with an individual's possessory interests in that
   property",^[56] such as when police officers take personal property
   away from an owner to use as evidence, or when they participate in an
   eviction.^[57] The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure
   of persons, including a brief detention.^[58]

   A seizure does not occur just because the government questions an
   individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar
   voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in
   a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if
   his freedom of movement is not restrained.^[54]^[59] The government may
   not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective
   grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not
   by itself furnish such grounds.^[58]

   Per United States v. Mendenhall (1980), a person is seized within the
   meaning of the Fourth Amendment only when, by means of physical force
   or show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in the
   circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would
   believe that he was not free to leave.^[58] In Florida v. Bostick
   (1991), the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a
   message that compliance with their requests is required, the police
   contact is a "citizen encounter" that falls outside the protections of
   the Fourth Amendment.^[60] If a person remains free to disregard
   questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore
   no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.^[58]

   When a person is arrested and taken into police custody, he has been
   seized (i.e., a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the
   back of a police car would not think they were free to leave). A person
   subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand, has been seized,
   but is not "arrested" because traffic stops are a relatively brief
   encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal
   arrest.^[61] If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior, a
   law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under
   arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity,
   provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the
   case.^[62] A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible
   under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment, so long as the
   arresting officer has probable cause.^[63]^[64] In Maryland v. King
   (2013), the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for
   DNA upon arrests for serious crimes, along the same reasoning that
   allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest
   and detain.^[65]^[66]

Exceptions

   The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without
   reasonable and articulable suspicion, with a few exceptions. In
   Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an
   illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in
   order to check his driver's license and the registration of the
   automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion
   that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered,
   or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure
   for violation of law.^[67]^[68]

   Where society's need is great, no other effective means of meeting the
   need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal,
   certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain
   motorists. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976), the Supreme
   Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints.^[69] In Michigan
   Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), the Supreme Court allowed
   discretionless sobriety checkpoints.^[70] In Illinois v. Lidster
   (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational
   checkpoints.^[71] However, in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond (2000),
   the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general
   crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.^[72]

Warrant

   Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement must receive written
   permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified magistrate, to
   lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal
   activity. A court grants permission by issuing a writ known as a
   warrant. A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and
   unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant^[73] and the
   police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable. ^[74] Searches and
   seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of
   the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the
   warrant requirement applies.^[37]^[75]^[76] These exceptions apply
   "[o]nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs,
   beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and
   probable cause requirement impracticable."^[77]

   In these situations where the warrant requirement doesn't apply a
   search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized
   suspicion of wrongdoing.^[78] However, the U.S. Supreme Court carved
   out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion. It
   ruled that, "In limited circumstances, where the privacy interests
   implicated by the search are minimal and where an important
   governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in
   jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion" a search [or
   seizure] would still be reasonable.^[79]

Probable cause

   Main article: Probable cause

   The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search. The
   government has a probable cause to make an arrest when "the facts and
   circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably
   trustworthy information" would lead a prudent person to believe that
   the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime.^[80]
   Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made. Evidence
   obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the
   arrest.^[81]

   When police conduct a search, the amendment requires that the warrant
   establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover
   criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient
   reasons to believe a search is necessary. In Carroll v. United States
   (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a
   flexible, common-sense standard.^[82]^[83] To that end, the Court ruled
   in Dumbra v. United States (1925) that the term probable cause means
   "less than evidence that would justify condemnation",^[84] reiterating
   Carroll's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to
   the officer would "warrant a man of reasonable caution" in the belief
   that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as
   evidence of a crime.^[85] It does not demand any showing that such a
   belief be correct or more likely true than false. A "practical,
   non-technical" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is
   all that is required.^[86] In Illinois v. Gates (1983), the Court ruled
   that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the
   "totality of the circumstances."^[87]

Exceptions to the warrant requirement

Consent

   Main article: Consent search

   If a party gives consent to a search, a warrant is not required. There
   are exceptions and complications to the rule, including the scope of
   the consent given, whether the consent is voluntarily given, and
   whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another's
   property.^[88] In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973), the Court ruled
   that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a
   suspect of his right to refuse the search.^[89] This contrasts with
   Fifth Amendment rights, which cannot be relinquished without an
   explicit Miranda warning from police.^[90]

   The Court stated in United States v. Matlock (1974) that a third party
   co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a
   suspect's Fourth Amendment rights.^[91]^[92] Per the Court's ruling in
   Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990),^[93] a consent search is still considered
   valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an "apparent
   authority", even if that party is later discovered to not have
   authority over the property in question.^[92]

Plain view and open fields

   Main articles: Plain view doctrine and Open-fields doctrine

   According to the plain view doctrine as defined in Coolidge v. New
   Hampshire (1971),^[94] if an officer is lawfully present, he may seize
   objects that are in "plain view". However, the officer must have had
   probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband.^[95]

   Similarly, "open fields" such as pastures, open water, and woods may be
   searched without a warrant, on the ground that conduct occurring
   therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy. The doctrine
   was first articulated by the Court in Hester v. United States (1924),
   which stated that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth
   Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and
   effects,' is not extended to the open fields."^[96]

   In Oliver v. United States (1984),^[97] the police ignored a "no
   trespassing" sign and a fence, trespassed onto the suspect's land
   without a warrant, followed a path for hundreds of feet, and discovered
   a field of marijuana. The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken
   place, because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open
   field:

     open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities
     that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government
     interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in
     protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation
     of crops, that occur in open fields.^[98]

   While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the
   curtilage, or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, is
   protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house
   and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's
   home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment. The
   curtilage is "intimately linked to the home, both physically and
   psychologically," and is where "privacy expectations are most
   heightened."^[99] However, courts have held aerial surveillance of
   curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search
   so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by
   the public. An area is curtilage if it "harbors the intimate activity
   associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of
   life."^[100] Courts make this determination by examining "whether the
   area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature
   of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the
   resident to protect the area from observation by people passing
   by."^[101] The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is
   typically treated as an invitation, or license, to the public to
   approach the front door of the home to deliver mail, sell goods,
   solicit for charities, etc. This license extends to the police, who
   have the right to try engaging a home's occupant in a "knock and talk"
   for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant. However, they
   cannot bring a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home
   without either a warrant or consent of the homeowner or resident.^[102]

Exigent circumstance

   Main article: Exigent circumstance in United States law

   Law enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless searches in
   several types of exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is
   dangerous or impractical. One example is the Terry stop, which allows
   police to frisk suspects for weapons.^[103] The Court also allowed a
   search of arrested persons in Weeks v. United States (1914) to preserve
   evidence that might otherwise be destroyed and to ensure suspects were
   disarmed.^[103]^[104] In Carroll v. United States (1925),^[82] the
   Court ruled that law enforcement officers could search a vehicle that
   they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant.^[103] The
   Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving
   suspects in Schmerber v. California (1966) on the grounds that the time
   to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect's blood alcohol content to
   reduce.^[103]^[105] Warden v. Hayden (1967) provided an exception to
   the warrant requirement if officers were in "hot pursuit" of a
   suspect.^[106]^[103]

Motor vehicle

   Main article: Motor vehicle exception

   The Supreme Court has held that individuals in automobiles have a
   reduced expectation of privacy, because vehicles generally do not serve
   as residences or repositories of personal effects. Vehicles may not be
   randomly stopped and searched; there must be probable cause or
   reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Items in plain view may be
   seized; areas that could potentially hide weapons may also be searched.
   With probable cause to believe evidence is present, police officers may
   search any area in the vehicle. However, they may not extend the search
   to the vehicle's passengers without probable cause to search those
   passengers or consent from the passengers.^[107]

   In Arizona v. Gant (2009),^[108] the Court ruled that a law enforcement
   officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an
   arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) at the time of the
   search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching
   distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police
   officers have reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which
   the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle.^[109]

Searches incident to a lawful arrest

   Main article: Searches incident to a lawful arrest

   A common law rule from Great Britain permits searches incident to an
   arrest without a warrant. This rule has been applied in American law,
   and has a lengthy common law history.^[110] The justification for such
   a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying
   evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by
   disarming the suspect.^[111] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that "both
   justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent
   and the rule does not apply", when "there is no possibility" that the
   suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence.^[112] In
   Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that "a search
   or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has
   always been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of
   the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest.
   But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a
   lawful arrest."^[113] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court
   reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to
   obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search
   incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the
   "immediate control" of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not
   define the term.^[114] In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the
   Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an
   arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee
   for weapons and evidence.^[115] However, in Riley v. California (2014),
   the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant
   to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier
   Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest
   without a warrant do not apply to “modern cellphones, which are now
   such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial
   visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of
   human anatomy,” and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically
   contain “a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from
   the mundane to the intimate.”^[116]^[117]

Border search exception

   Main article: Border search exception

   Searches conducted at the United States border or the equivalent of the
   border (such as an international airport) may be conducted without a
   warrant or probable cause subject to the border search
   exception.^[118]^[119]^[120]^[121] Most border searches may be
   conducted entirely at random, without any level of suspicion, pursuant
   to U.S. Customs and Border Protection plenary search authority.
   However, searches that intrude upon a traveler's personal dignity and
   privacy interests, such as strip and body cavity searches, must be
   supported by "reasonable suspicion."^[120]^[122] The U.S. Courts of
   Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth circuits have ruled that information
   on a traveler's electronic materials, including personal files on a
   laptop computer, may be searched at random, without
   suspicion.^[120]^[123]^[124]

Foreign intelligence surveillance

   The Supreme Court decision in United States v. U.S. District Court
   (1972)^[125] left open the possibility for a foreign intelligence
   surveillance exception to the warrant clause.^[126] Three United States
   Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance
   exception to the warrant clause, but tied it to certain
   requirements.^[126] The exception to the Fourth Amendment was formally
   recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
   of Review in its 2008 In re Directives^[127] decision.^[128] The lower
   court held that, "a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth
   Amendment's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted
   to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is
   directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably
   believed to be located outside the United States."^[128] Despite the
   foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against
   unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of
   all communications, whatever the means, because, "a person's private
   communications are akin to personal papers."^[129] To protect the
   telecommunication carriers cooperating with the US government from
   legal action, the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign
   Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this type of
   surveillance.^[130]

Other exceptions

   In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court ruled that searches
   in public schools do not require warrants, as long as the searching
   officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will
   result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity.^[76] However, in
   Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009),^[131] the Court
   ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they
   strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to
   have received drugs from that student.^[132] Similarly, in Samson v.
   California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be
   searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government
   employees on similar grounds.^[133] Searches of prison cells are
   subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable
   cause.^[134]

Exclusionary rule

   Main article: Exclusionary rule

   One way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the
   exclusionary rule. The rule provides that evidence obtained through a
   violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not admissible by the
   prosecution during the defendant's criminal trial.^[135] The Court
   stated in Elkins v. United States (1960)^[136] that the rule's function
   "is to deter—to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the
   only effectively available way—by removing the incentive to disregard
   it."^[135]

   The Court adopted the exclusionary rule in Weeks v. United States
   (1914),^[104] prior to which all evidence, no matter how seized, could
   be admitted in court.^[137] In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States
   (1920)^[138] and Nardone v. United States (1939),^[139] the Court ruled
   that leads or other evidence resulting from illegally obtained evidence
   are also inadmissible in trials. Justice Felix Frankfurter described
   this secondary evidence in the Nardone decision as the "fruit of the
   poisonous tree".^[140] The Supreme Court rejected incorporating the
   exclusionary rule by way of the Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf v.
   Colorado (1949),^[141] but explicitly overruled this decision in Mapp
   v. Ohio (1961),^[28] making the Fourth Amendment (including the
   exclusionary rule) applicable in state proceedings.^[142]

   The exclusionary rule and its effectiveness have often been
   controversial, particularly since its 1961 application to state
   proceedings. Critics charge that the rule hampers police investigation
   and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable
   evidence; other critics state that the rule has not been successful in
   deterring illegal police searches. Proponents argue that the number of
   criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and
   that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth
   Amendment.^[135] In 1982, California passed a "Victim's Bill of Rights"
   containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule; though the bill
   could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment,
   it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections
   further.^[143]^[144]

Limitations

   Responding to criticisms of the exclusionary rule, the Supreme Court
   has instituted numerous limitations to the rule.^[135] In United States
   v. Calandra (1974),^[145] the Court ruled that in questioning
   witnesses, grand juries may use evidence that allegedly was illegally
   obtained because, "the damage to that institution from the
   unprecedented extension of the exclusionary rule outweighs the benefit
   of any possible incremental deterrent effect."^[146]

   Several cases in 1984 further restricted the exclusionary rule. In
   United States v. Leon,^[147] the Court, applying the "good faith" rule,
   ruled that evidence seized by officers relying in good faith on a
   warrant was still admissible, even though the warrant was later found
   to be defective. Evidence would be excluded, however, if an officer
   dishonestly or recklessly prepared an affidavit to seek a warrant, the
   issuing magistrate abandoned his neutrality, or the warrant lacked
   sufficient particularity.^[148] The Court determined in Nix v.
   Williams^[149] that "fruit of the poisonous tree" evidence could still
   be introduced if a prosecutor could demonstrate that it would have been
   an "inevitable discovery" of legitimate investigation.^[150] In Segura
   v. United States,^[151] the Court ruled that evidence illegally found
   without a search warrant is admissible if the evidence is later found
   and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal
   search.^[152]

   In Arizona v. Evans (1995)^[153] and Herring v. United States
   (2009),^[154] the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply
   to evidence found due to negligence regarding a government database, as
   long as the arresting police officer relied on that database in "good
   faith" and the negligence was not pervasive.^[155]^[156] In Davis v.
   United States (2011),^[157] the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule
   does not apply to a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from a
   reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent.^[158]

   The rule has also been held not to apply in the following
   circumstances:
     * evidence illegally seized by a "private actor" (i.e., not a
       governmental employee)^[159]
     * evidence seized from a common carrier^[160]
     * tax hearings^[161]
     * evidence collected by U.S. Customs agents^[162]
     * deportation hearings^[163]
     * military discharge proceedings^[164]
     * evidence seized by probation or parole officers^[165]
     * child protective proceedings^[166]
     * probation or parole revocation hearings^[167]
