   Elections

   The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political
   parties in the United States, along with the younger Republican Party.
   Tracing its origins back to the Democratic-Republican Party, the modern
   Democratic Party was founded around 1828.^[7] There have been 15
   Democratic presidents, the first being Andrew Jackson, who served from
   1829 to 1837; the most recent is the current president, Barack Obama,
   who has served since 2009.

   Since the 1930s, the party has promoted a social-liberal platform,
   supporting social justice and a mixed economy.^[2]^[8]^[9] Until the
   late 20th century the party had a powerful conservative and populist
   wing based in the rural South, which over time has greatly diminished.
   Today its Congressional caucus is composed mostly of progressives and
   centrists.^[10]

   As of the 113th Congress, following the 2012 elections, the Democratic
   Party holds a minority of seats in the House of Representatives and a
   majority of seats in the United States Senate, as well as a minority of
   state governorships and control of a minority of state legislatures.

History

   Main article: History of the United States Democratic Party
   Andrew Jackson is typically considered the first Democratic President
   of the United States

1828-1860

   The Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or
   Democratic-Republican Party organized by Thomas Jefferson and James
   Madison in opposition to the Federalist party of Alexander Hamilton and
   John Adams. The party favored republicanism, a weak federal government,
   states' rights, agrarian interests (especially Southern planters) and
   strict adherence to the Constitution; it opposed a national bank, close
   ties to Great Britain, and business and banking interests. The Party
   came to power in the election of 1800.

   After the War of 1812, the Federalists virtually disappeared and the
   Jeffersonian party split into factions. They split over the choice of a
   successor to President James Monroe, and the party faction that
   supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew
   Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the Democratic Party. As Norton
   explains the transformation in 1828:

          Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed.
          Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties,
          political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had
          elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first
          well-organized national party...and tight party organization
          became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American
          politics."^[11]

   Opposing factions led by Henry Clay helped form the Whig Party. The
   Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs
   until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.
   In 1854, angry with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, anti-slavery Democrats
   left the party and joined Northern Whigs to form the Republican
   Party.^[12]^[13]

   Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a
   widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:

          The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a
          fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an
          agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the
          enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 "corrupt bargain" had
          strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics….
          Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political
          power. They believed that government intervention in the economy
          benefited special-interest groups and created corporate
          monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the
          independence of the individual--the artisan and the ordinary
          farmer--by ending federal support of banks and corporations and
          restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted.
          Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be
          negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in
          negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous
          presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed
          reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs
          into legislation called for a more active government. But
          Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid
          the establishment of a public education system. They believed,
          for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty
          by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined
          freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson
          share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for
          American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along
          the Trail of Tears.^[14]

1860s

   The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President James
   Buchanan along Northern and Southern lines; factions of the party
   provided two separate candidacies for President in the election of
   1860, in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy. Southern
   Democrats, after some delegates followed the lead of the Fire-Eaters by
   walking out of the Democratic convention at Charleston's Institute Hall
   in April 1860, and were subsequently joined by those who, once again
   led by the Fire-Eaters, left the Baltimore Convention the following
   June when the convention would not adopt a resolution supporting
   extending slavery into territories whose voters did not want it,
   nominated the pro-slavery incumbent Vice-President, John C.
   Breckinridge of Kentucky, for President and General Joseph Lane, former
   Governor of Oregon, for Vice President. The Northern Democrats
   proceeded to nominate Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for
   President and former Governor of Georgia Herschel V. Johnson for
   Vice-President, while some southern Democrats joined the Constitutional
   Union Party, backing its nominees (who had both been prominent Whig
   leaders), former Senator, Speaker of the House, and Secretary of War
   John Bell of Tennessee for President and the politician, statesman, and
   educator Edward Everett of Massachusetts for Vice-President. This
   fracturing of the Democrats led to a Republican victory, and Abraham
   Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States.

   As the American Civil War broke out, Northern Democrats were divided
   into War Democrats and Peace Democrats. The Confederate States of
   America, whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in
   antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity,
   largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance;
   consequently the Confederacy had none, or at least none with the wide
   organization inherent to other American parties. Most War Democrats
   rallied to Republican President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans'
   National Union Party in the election of 1864, which featured Andrew
   Johnson on the Republican ticket even though he was a Democrat from the
   South. Johnson replaced Lincoln in 1865 but stayed independent of both
   parties. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of
   Reconstruction after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican
   Party. After Redeemers ended Reconstruction in the 1870s, and following
   the often extremely violent disenfranchisement of African Americans led
   by such white supremacist Democratic politicians as Benjamin Tillman of
   South Carolina in the 1880s and 1890s, the South, voting Democratic,
   became known as the "Solid South." Though Republicans won all but two
   presidential elections, the Democrats remained competitive. The party
   was dominated by pro-business Bourbon Democrats led by Samuel J. Tilden
   and Grover Cleveland, who represented mercantile, banking, and railroad
   interests; opposed imperialism and overseas expansion; fought for the
   gold standard; opposed bimetallism; and crusaded against corruption,
   high taxes, and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive
   presidential terms in 1884 and 1892.^[15]

1900s

   Franklin D. Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States (1933–1945)

   Agrarian Democrats demanding Free Silver overthrew the Bourbon
   Democrats in 1896 and nominated William Jennings Bryan for the
   presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan
   waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he
   lost to Republican William McKinley. The Democrats took control of the
   House in 1910 and elected Woodrow Wilson as president in 1912 and 1916.
   Wilson effectively led Congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs,
   money, and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years with new
   progressive laws. The Great Depression in 1929 that occurred under
   Republican President Herbert Hoover and the Republican Congress set the
   stage for a more liberal government; the Democrats controlled the House
   of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1931 until 1995 and won
   most presidential elections until 1968. Franklin D. Roosevelt, elected
   to the presidency in 1932, came forth with government programs called
   the New Deal. New Deal liberalism meant the promotion of social
   welfare, labor unions, civil rights, and regulation of business. The
   opponents, who stressed long-term growth, support for business, and low
   taxes, started calling themselves "conservatives."^[16]

Modern era

   President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Immigration Act of 1965 as Sen.
   Edward Kennedy, Sen. Robert Kennedy, and others look on.

   Issues facing parties and the United States after World War II included
   the Cold War and the Civil Rights Movement. Republicans attracted
   conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with
   their use of the Southern strategy and resistance to New Deal and Great
   Society liberalism. African Americans had traditionally supported the
   Republican Party because of the anti-slavery agenda of Abraham Lincoln
   and successors such as Ulysses Grant. But they began supporting
   Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin Roosevelt
   administration, the New Deal, the integration of the military and
   embrace of proposed civil rights legislation by President Harry Truman
   in 1947–48, and the postwar Civil Rights movement. The Democratic
   Party's main base of support shifted to the Northeast, marking a
   dramatic reversal of history. Bill Clinton was elected to the
   presidency in 1992, governing as a New Democrat. The Democratic Party
   lost control of Congress in the election of 1994 to the Republican
   Party. Re-elected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic President
   since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected to two terms. Following twelve
   years of Republican rule, the Democratic Party regained majority
   control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections. Some of
   the party's key issues in the early 21st century in their last national
   platform have included the methods of how to combat terrorism, homeland
   security, expanding access to health care, labor rights,
   environmentalism, and the preservation of liberal government
   programs.^[17] In the 2010 elections, the Democratic Party lost control
   of the House, but kept a small majority in the Senate (reduced from the
   111th Congress). It also lost its majority in state legislatures and
   state governorships. However, the 2012 elections which re-elected
   President Obama represented a partial reversal of the results of the
   2010 midterm vote, increasing the Democratic majority in the Senate and
   reducing the Republican majority in the House.
   John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States (1961–1963)

   The Democratic Party traces its origins to the inspiration of the
   Democratic-Republican Party, founded by Thomas Jefferson, James
   Madison, and other influential opponents of the Federalists in 1792.
   That party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans.
   Organizationally, the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s,
   with the election of Andrew Jackson. Since the division of the
   Republican Party in the election of 1912, it has gradually positioned
   itself to the left of the Republican Party on economic and social
   issues.
   Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States (1993–2001)

   Until the period following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
   1964—which was championed by a Democratic president but faced lower
   Democratic than Republican support in Congress—the Democratic Party was
   primarily a coalition of two parties divided by region. Southern
   Democrats were typically given high conservative ratings by the
   American Conservative Union while northern Democrats were typically
   given very liberal ratings. Southern Democrats were a core bloc of the
   bipartisan conservative coalition which lasted through the Reagan-era.
   The economically activist philosophy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, which
   has strongly influenced American liberalism, has shaped much of the
   party's economic agenda since 1932, and served to tie the two regional
   factions of the party together until the late 1960s. In fact,
   Roosevelt's New Deal coalition usually controlled the national
   government until the 1970s.^[18]
   Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States (2009-present)

   Based on a poll conducted in 2014, Gallup found that 30% of Americans
   identified as Democrats, 23% as Republicans, and 45% as
   Independents.^[19] In the same poll a survey of registered voters
   stated that 47% identified as Democrats or leaned towards the party;
   the same poll found that 40% of registered voters identified as
   Republicans or leaned towards the Republican party.

Name and symbols

   "A Live Jackass Kicking a Dead Lion" by Thomas Nast. Harper's Weekly,
   January 19, 1870.
   The donkey party logo is still a well-known symbol for the Democratic
   Party, despite not being the official logo of the party.
   The Democratic donkey party logo in a modernized "kicking donkey" form

   Initially calling itself the "Republican Party," Jeffersonians were
   labeled "Democratic" by the opposition Federalists, with the hope of
   stigmatizing them as purveyors of democracy or mob rule.^[22] By the
   Jacksonian era, the term "The Democracy" was in use by the party; the
   name "Democratic Party" was eventually settled upon^[23] and became the
   official name in 1844.^[24]

   The term "Democrat party" has also been in local use but has usually
   been used by opponents since 1952 as an epithet.

   The most common mascot symbol for the party has been jackass or the
   donkey.^[25] Andrew Jackson's enemies twisted his name to "jackass" as
   a term of ridicule regarding a stupid and stubborn animal. However the
   Democrats liked the common-man implications and picked it up too, so
   the image persisted and evolved.^[26] Its most lasting impression came
   from the cartoons of Thomas Nast 1870 in Harper's Weekly. Cartoonists
   followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the
   elephant to represent the Republicans.

   In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic
   Party in Midwestern states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Ohio
   was the rooster, as opposed to the Republican eagle. This symbol still
   appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia^[27] ballots.
   In New York, the Democratic ballot symbol is a five-pointed star.^[28]
   For the majority of the 20th century, Missouri Democrats used the
   Statue of Liberty as their ballot emblem. This meant that when
   Libertarian candidates received ballot access in Missouri in 1976, they
   could not use the Statue of Liberty, their national symbol, as the
   ballot emblem. Missouri Libertarians instead used the Liberty Bell
   until 1995, when the mule became Missouri's state animal. From 1995 to
   2004, there was some confusion among voters, as the Democratic ticket
   was marked with the Statue of Liberty (used by Libertarians in other
   states) and the Libertarians' mule was easily mistaken for a Democratic
   donkey.

   Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the
   traditional American red, white, and blue colors in their marketing and
   representations, since election night 2000 the color blue has become
   the identified color of the Democratic Party, while the color red has
   become the identified color of the Republican Party. That night, for
   the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same
   color scheme for the electoral map: blue states for Al Gore (Democratic
   nominee) and red states for George W. Bush (Republican nominee). Since
   then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the
   party. This has caused confusion among non-American observers because
   blue is the traditional color of the right and red the color of the
   left outside of the United States. For example, in Canada red
   represents the Liberals, while blue represents the Conservatives. In
   the United Kingdom, red denotes the Labour Party and blue symbolizes
   the Conservative Party. Blue has also been used both by party
   supporters for promotional efforts — ActBlue, BuyBlue, BlueFund, as
   examples — and by the party itself in 2006 both for its "Red to Blue
   Program", created to support Democratic candidates running against
   Republican incumbents in the midterm elections that year, and on its
   official website.

   In September, 2010, the Democratic Party unveiled its new logo, which
   featured a blue D inside a blue circle. It was the party's first
   official logo, as the donkey logo had only been semi-official.

   Jefferson-Jackson Day is the annual fundraising event (dinner) held by
   Democratic Party organizations across the United States.^[29] It is
   named after Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, whom the
   party regards as its distinguished early leaders.

   The song "Happy Days Are Here Again" is the unofficial song of the
   Democratic Party. It was used prominently when Franklin D. Roosevelt
   was nominated for president at the 1932 Democratic National Convention
   and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. For example,
   Paul Shaffer played the theme on the Late Show with David Letterman
   after the Democrats won Congress in 2006. "Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac
   was adopted by Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and has
   endured as a popular Democratic song. Also, the emotionally similar
   song "Beautiful Day" by the band U2 has become a favorite theme song
   for Democratic candidates. John Kerry used the song during his 2004
   presidential campaign, and several Democratic Congressional candidates
   used it as a celebratory tune in 2006.^[30]^[31] Aaron Copland's
   Fanfare for the Common Man is traditionally performed at the beginning
   of the Democratic National Convention.

Current structure and composition

   The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is responsible for promoting
   Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for
   overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is
   more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public
   policy. In presidential elections, it supervises the Democratic
   National Convention. The national convention is, subject to the charter
   of the party, the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when
   it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at
   other times. The DNC is chaired by Florida congresswoman Debbie
   Wasserman Schultz.^[32]

   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) assists party
   candidates in House races; its current chairman (selected by the party
   caucus) is Rep. Steve Israel of New York. Similarly, the Democratic
   Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), headed by Senator Patty Murray of
   Washington, raises large sums for Senate races. The Democratic
   Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), chaired by Mike Gronstal of
   Iowa, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on
   state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the College Democrats of
   America (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of
   training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists.
   Democrats Abroad is the organization for Americans living outside the
   United States; they work to advance the goals of the party and
   encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The Young
   Democrats of America (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to
   draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates, but
   operates outside of the DNC. In addition, the recently created branch
   of the Young Democrats, the Young Democrats High School Caucus,
   attempts to raise awareness and activism amongst teenagers to not only
   vote and volunteer, but participate in the future as well. The
   Democratic Governors Association (DGA), chaired by Governor Peter
   Shumlin of Vermont, is an organization supporting the candidacies of
   Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents. Likewise, the mayors
   of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the National
   Conference of Democratic Mayors.

   Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee
   members as well as ex-officio committee members (usually elected
   officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn
   elects a chair. County, town, city, and ward committees generally are
   composed of individuals elected at the local level. State and local
   committees often coordinate campaign activities within their
   jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or
   caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected
   office under state law. Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005,
   DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the "50 State Strategy") of
   using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and pay for
   full-time professional staffers.^[33]

   Since the 1890s, the Democratic Party has favored liberal positions
   (the term "liberal" in this sense describes modern liberalism, not
   classical liberalism). In recent exit polls, the Democratic Party has
   had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic
   demographics.^[34]^[35]^[36]

   Historically, the party has favored farmers, laborers, labor unions,
   and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated
   business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign
   policy, internationalism (including interventionism) was a dominant
   theme from 1913 to the mid-1960s. In the 1930s, the party began
   advocating welfare spending programs targeted at the poor. The party
   had a fiscally conservative, pro-business wing, typified by Grover
   Cleveland and Al Smith, and a Southern conservative wing that shrank
   after President Lyndon B. Johnson supported the Civil Rights Act of
   1964. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which
   peaked in the 1936–1952 era), and the African American wing, which has
   steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, environmentalism has
   been a major new component.

   In recent decades, the party has adopted a centrist economic and
   socially progressive agenda, with the voter base having shifted
   considerably to the right. Democrats began to advocate for more social
   justice, affirmative action, a balanced budget, and a market economy
   tempered by government intervention (mixed economy). The economic
   policy adopted by the modern Democratic Party, including the former
   Clinton administration, has been referred to as "Third Way".^[37]^[38]

   The Democratic Party, once dominant in the Southeastern United States,
   is now strongest in the Northeast (Mid-Atlantic and New England), Great
   Lakes region, and the Pacific Coast (including Hawaii). The Democrats
   are also very strong in major cities (regardless of region).

Liberals

   Main articles: Modern liberalism in the United States and Liberalism in
   the United States
   Eleanor Roosevelt at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago,
   1956

   Social liberals (modern liberals) and progressives constitute the
   majority of the Democratic voter base. Liberals thereby form the
   largest united demographic within the Democratic base. According to the
   2012 exit poll results, liberals constituted 25% of the electorate, and
   86% of American liberals favored the candidate of the Democratic
   Party.^[39] White-collar college-educated professionals were mostly
   Republican until the 1950s; they now compose perhaps the most vital
   component of the Democratic Party.^[40]

   A large majority of liberals favor universal health care, with many
   supporting a single-payer system. A majority also favor diplomacy over
   military action, stem cell research, the legalization of same-sex
   marriage, stricter gun control, and environmental protection laws as
   well as the preservation of abortion rights. Immigration and cultural
   diversity is deemed positive; liberals favor cultural pluralism, a
   system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to
   adopting their new culture. They tend to be divided on free trade
   agreements and organizations such as the North American Free Trade
   Agreement (NAFTA). Most liberals oppose increased military spending and
   the mixing of church and state.^[41]

   This ideological group differs from the traditional organized labor
   base. According to the Pew Research Center, a plurality of 41% resided
   in mass affluent households and 49% were college graduates, the highest
   figure of any typographical group. It was also the fastest growing
   typological group between the late 1990s and early 2000s.^[41] Liberals
   include most of academia^[42] and large portions of the professional
   class.^[34]^[35]^[36]

Progressives

   Main articles: Progressivism in the United States and Congressional
   Progressive Caucus

   Progressives are a reformist faction within the party.^[43] Many
   progressive Democrats are descendants of the New Left of Democratic
   presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota; others
   were involved in the presidential candidacies of Vermont Governor
   Howard Dean and U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio.
   Progressives strongly support issues such as campaign finance reform,
   environmentalism, raising the capital gains tax, anti-corruption
   policies, secularism, network neutrality, banking reform, and
   single-payer health care.^[44]^[45] Progressives favor a mixed economy
   and the welfare state.^[46] They support social justice, collective
   bargaining, and social progressivism. Today progressives have made the
   fight against economic inequality their top priority.^[47] Progressives
   are generally considered to be synonymous with Liberals, however the
   two groups differ on a variety issues.^[48]^[49]

   The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is a caucus of progressive
   Democrats, and is the single largest Democratic caucus in the House of
   Representatives. Its members have included U.S. Representative Dennis
   Kucinich of Ohio, U.S. Representative John Conyers of Michigan, U.S.
   Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, U.S. Representative John
   Lewis of Georgia, U.S. Representative Barbara Lee of California, the
   late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Senators Sherrod Brown of
   Ohio, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, and Ed Markey
   of Massachusetts were all members of the caucus when in the House of
   Representatives. Today, no Democratic Senators belong to the
   Progressive Caucus, however Independent senator Bernie Sanders is a
   member. America Votes and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights are
   liberal umbrella organizations that push for progressive causes.

Centrists

   See also: New Democrats, New Democrat Coalition and Third Way

   Though centrist Democrats differ on a variety of issues, they typically
   foster a mix of political views and ideas. Unlike other Democratic
   factions, they tend to be supportive of the use of military force,
   including the war in Iraq, and are more willing to reduce government
   welfare, as indicated by their support for welfare reform and tax
   cuts.^[50] One of the most influential factions was the Democratic
   Leadership Council (DLC), a nonprofit organization that advocated
   centrist positions for the party. The DLC hailed President Bill Clinton
   as proof of the viability of "Third Way" politicians and a DLC success
   story, the DLC disbanded in 2011. Much of the former DLC is now
   represented in the think tank Third Way.^[51] Centrist Democrats form
   the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives and
   Senate.^[49]

Conservatives

   See also: Conservative Democrats, Blue Dog Coalition and Democrat In
   Name Only

   In the House of Representatives, the Blue Dog Coalition, a caucus of
   fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and moderates forms much of
   the Democratic Party's current faction of conservative democrats. They
   have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past, giving their members
   some ability to change legislation and broker compromises with the
   Republican Party's leadership. Historically, southern democrats were
   generally much more ideologically conservative than conservative
   democrats are now. In 1972, the last year that a sizable number of
   conservatives dominated the southern wing of the Democratic Party, the
   American Conservative Union gave higher ratings to most southern
   Democratic Senators and Congressmen than it did to Republicans.

   There was a split vote among many conservative Southern Democrats in
   the 1970s and 1980s. Some supported local and statewide conservative
   Democrats while simultaneously voting for Republican presidential
   candidates.^[52]

Libertarians and civil liberties advocates

   See also: Libertarian Democrat and Democratic Freedom Caucus

   Some libertarians support the Democratic Party because Democratic
   positions on issues such as civil rights and the separation of church
   and state are more closely aligned to their own than those of the
   Republican Party. They oppose gun control, the "War on Drugs,"
   protectionism, corporate welfare, government debt, and an
   interventionist foreign policy. The Democratic Freedom Caucus is an
   organized group of this faction, whose economic program involves
   shifting existing taxes to mainly land and natural resources.

   Some civil liberties advocates also support the party because of their
   support of habeas corpus for unlawful combatants, opposition to torture
   of suspected terrorists, extraordinary rendition, warrantless
   wiretapping, indefinite detention without trial or charge, the Patriot
   Act, the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and what they see as the erosion of
   the protections of the Bill of Rights.^[53]

Economic issues

Economic policy and jobs

   The party espouses a mixed economy, which tempers a free market economy
   by providing government intervention in an effort to reduce economic
   inequality. This is also known as a social market economy. The party
   sees increased wages, labor unions, tax cuts for small businesses and
   low-earners, public welfare, government regulated health care and
   public education as tools to create a balanced and fair economy. They
   support infrastructure development and other government sponsored
   programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation,
   while stimulating private sector job creation.^[72] Beginning with the
   rise of modern liberalism in the 1930s, the party has supported
   Keynesian economics.^[73] However since the 1990s the party has at
   times supporting neoliberal economic reforms, which cut the size of
   government and reduced market regulations.^[74]

Environment

   Main article: Environmental policy of the United States

   Democrats believe that the government should protect the environment
   and have a history of environmentalism. In more recent years, this
   stance has had as its emphasis alternative energy generation as the
   basis for an improved economy, greater national security, and general
   environmental benefits.^[75]

   The Democratic Party also favors expansion of conservation lands and
   encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport
   congestion and improve air quality and economy; it "believe[s] that
   communities, environmental interests, and government should work
   together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local
   economies. Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice
   between the economy and the environment. They now know this is a false
   choice."^[76]

   The most important environmental concern of the Democratic Party is
   climate change. Democrats, most notably former Vice President Al Gore,
   have pressed for stern regulation of greenhouse gases. On October 15,
   2007, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to build greater
   knowledge about man-made climate change, and laying the foundations for
   the measures needed to counteract these changes asserting that "the
   climate crisis is not a political issue, it is a moral and spiritual
   challenge to all of humanity."^[77]

Fiscal policy

   Democrats support a more progressive tax structure to provide more
   services and reduce economic inequality by making sure that the
   wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes.^[78] Democrats
   support more government spending on social services while spending less
   on the military.^[79]^[80] They oppose the cutting of social services,
   such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare
   programs,^[81] believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social
   justice. Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary
   and non-monetary terms, are a more productive labor force and cultured
   population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any
   benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top
   earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social
   services as essential towards providing positive freedom, i.e. freedom
   derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of
   Representatives reinstated the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the
   start of the 110th Congress.^[82]

Minimum wage

   The Democratic Party favors raising the minimum wage and believes that
   all Americans have the right to a fair wage. They call for a $10.10 an
   hour national minimum wage and think the minimum wage should continue
   be adjusted regularly.^[83] The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an
   early component of the Democrats' agenda during the 110th Congress. In
   2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase
   the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed.^[84]

Health care

   President Barack Obama signing the Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act into law at the White House on March 23, 2010.

   Democrats call for "affordable and quality health care," and many
   advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area.
   Democrats favor national health insurance or universal health care in a
   variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern health
   insurance. Some Democrats, such as Representatives John Conyers and
   John Dingell, have called for a single-payer program of Medicare for
   All. The Progressive Democrats of America, a group operating inside the
   Democratic Party, has made single-payer universal health care one of
   their primary policy goals.^[85] The Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act, signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, has
   been one of the most significant pushes for universal health care to
   become a reality. As of April 2014, more than 10 million Americans have
   enrolled in healthcare coverage since the launch of the Affordable Care
   Act.^[86]

Public education

   Democrats favor improving public education and increasing government
   spending on all forms of learning.^[84] Democrats have the long-term
   aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low
   tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada), which should be
   available to every eligible American student, or alternatively, with
   increasing state funding for student financial aid such as the Pell
   Grant or college tuition tax deduction.^[87]^[88]

Renewable energy and fossil fuels

   Democrats have supported increadomestic renewable energy development,
   including wind and solar farms, in an effort to reduce carbon
   pollution. The party has supported higher taxes on oil companies and
   increased regulations on coal power plants, favoring a policy of
   reducing long-term reliance on fossil fuels.^[89]^[90]

Trade agreements

   Many Democrats support fair trade policies when it comes to the issue
   of international trade agreements, although the party has started
   supporting free trade in past years.^[91] In the 1990s, the Clinton
   administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a
   number of agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement
   (NAFTA). Since then, the party's shift away from free trade became
   evident in the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) vote, with
   15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting
   against.^[92]^[93]

Social issues

Abortion and reproductive rights

   The Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to birth
   control, and support public funding of contraception for poor women.
   The Democratic Party, in its national platforms from 1992 to 2004, has
   called for abortion to be "safe, legal and rare" — namely, keeping it
   legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in
   abortion decisions, and reducing the number of abortions by promoting
   both knowledge of reproduction and contraception, and incentives for
   adoption. The wording changed in the 2008 platform. When Congress voted
   on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003, Congressional Democrats
   were split, with a minority (including current Senate Majority Leader
   Harry Reid) supporting the ban, and the majority of Democrats opposing
   the legislation.^[94]

   The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court
   decision Roe v. Wade, which declared abortion covered by the
   constitutionally protected individual right to privacy under the Ninth
   Amendment, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which lays out the legal
   framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is
   assessed by courts. As a matter of the right to privacy and of gender
   equality, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to
   choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that
   each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for
   herself whether abortion is morally correct.

   Current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid self-identifies as
   'pro-life', while President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader
   Nancy Pelosi self-identify as 'pro-choice'. Groups such as Democrats
   for Life of America represent the pro-life faction of the party, while
   groups such as EMILY's List represent the pro-choice faction. A
   Newsweek poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were
   pro-life while a 69% majority was pro-choice.^[95]

Immigration

   See also: Immigration to the United States and Illegal immigration to
   the United States

   Many Democratic politicians have called for systematic reform of the
   U.S. immigration system such that residents that have come into the
   U.S. illegally have a pathway to legal citizenship. President Obama
   remarked on November 2013 that he felt it was "long past time to fix
   our broken immigration system", particularly to allow "incredibly
   bright young people" that came over as students to become full
   citizens. The Public Religion Research Institute found in a late 2013
   study that 73% of Democrats supported the pathway concept, compared to
   63% of Americans as a whole.^[96]

   In 2013, Democrats in the Senate passed S.744, which would reform
   immigration policy to allow citizenship for illegal immigrants in the
   US and improve the lives of all immigrants currently living in the
   United States.^[97]

LGBT rights

   The Democratic Party is supportive of LGBT rights. Most support for
   same-sex marriage in the United States has come from Democrats,
   although some favor civil unions instead or oppose same-sex marriage.
   Support for same-sex marriage has increased in the past decade
   according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public
   opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%,^[98] while a June 2008
   Newsweek poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage
   while 23% support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28%
   oppose any legal recognition at all.^[99] A broad majority of Democrats
   have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending hate crime
   statutes, legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the
   workforce, and repealing Don't ask, don't tell. A 2006 Pew Research
   Center poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting
   children with 40% opposed while 70% support gays in the military with
   only 23% opposed.^[100] Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of
   Democrats support open enlistment.^[101]

   The 2004 Democratic National Platform stated that marriage should be
   defined at the state level and it repudiated the Federal Marriage
   Amendment.^[102] The 2008 platform, while not stating support of
   same-sex marriage, called for repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act,
   which banned federal recognition of same-sex marriage and removed the
   need for interstate recognition, supported antidiscrimination laws and
   the extension of hate crime laws to LGBT people, and opposed the don't
   ask, don't tell military policy.^[103] The 2012 platform included
   support for same-sex marriage and for the repeal of DOMA.^[104]

   President Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to say
   he supports same-sex marriage, announcing his position on May 9,
   2012.^[105]^[106] Previously, he had opposed restrictions on same-sex
   marriage such as the Defense of Marriage Act, which he promised to
   repeal,^[107] California's Prop 8,^[108] and a constitutional amendment
   to ban same-sex marriage (which he opposed saying that "decisions about
   marriage should be left to the states as they always have been."^[109])
   but also stated that he personally believed marriage to be between a
   man and a woman and that he favored civil unions that would "give
   same-sex couples equal legal rights and privileges as married
   couples".^[107] Earlier, when running for the Illinois Senate in 1996,
   he said that he "unequivocally support(ed) gay marriage" and "favor(ed)
   legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such
   marriages."^[110] Senator John Kerry, Democratic presidential candidate
   in 2004, did not support same-sex marriage. Former President Bill
   Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore said in 2009 that they now
   support gay marriage.^[111]^[112]

Social equality

   The Democratic Party supports equal opportunity for all Americans
   regardless of sex, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender
   identity, religion, creed, or national origin. Many Democrats support
   affirmative action programs to further this goal. Democrats also
   strongly support the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit
   discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability.
   As such, the Democrats pushed as well the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a
   legal expansion that became law.^[113]

Voting rights

   The party is very supportive of improving voting rights as well as
   election accuracy and accessibility.^[114] They support increasing
   voting time and ending voter ID laws. They support reforming the
   electoral system as well as passing comprehensive campaign finance
   reform.^[67] The party supported the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and as a
   party have often been pioneers for democracy in the United States.^[69]

Legal issues

Death penalty

   The Democratic Party supports the death penalty far less than the
   Republican Party. Though most Democrats in Congress have never
   seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both
   Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with
   little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death
   penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have
   also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those
   states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During
   the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal
   death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the
   Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law
   by President Clinton, the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty
   cases.

   In 1992, 1993, and 1995, Democratic Texas Congressman Henry González
   unsuccessfully introduced the Death Penalty Abolition Amendment which
   prohibited the use of capital punishment in the United States.
   Democratic Missouri Congressman William Lacy Clay, Sr. cosponsored the
   amendment in 1993.

   During his Illinois Senate career, now-President Barack Obama
   successfully introduced legislation intended to reduce the likelihood
   of wrongful convictions in capital cases, requiring videotaping of
   confessions. When campaigning for the presidency, Obama stated that he
   supports the limited use of the death penalty, including for people who
   have been convicted of raping a minor under the age of 12, having
   opposed the Supreme Court's ruling in Kennedy v. Louisiana that the
   death penalty was unconstitutional in child rape cases.^[115] Obama has
   stated that he thinks the "death penalty does little to deter crime",
   and that it is used too frequently and too inconsistently.^[116]

Gun control

   With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party
   has introduced various gun control measures, most notably the Gun
   Control Act of 1968, the Brady Bill of 1993, and Crime Control Act of
   1994. However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western
   Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned
   the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas
   because of the issue.^[117] In the national platform for 2008, the only
   statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for
   renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban.^[118]

Patriot Act

   Many Democrats are opposed to the Patriot Act, however when the law was
   passed most Democrats were supportive of it and all but two Democrats
   in the U.S. Senate voted for the original Patriot Act legislation in
   2001. The lone nay vote was from Russ Feingold of Wisconsin; Mary
   Landrieu of Louisiana did not vote. In the House the Democrats voted
   for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay. Democrats split on the renewal in
   2006. In the Senate, Democrats voted 34 for the 2006 renewal, and 9
   against. In the House, Democrats voted 66 voted for the renewal, and
   124 against.^[119]

Right to privacy

   The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a right to
   privacy. For example, many Democrats have opposed the NSA warrantless
   surveillance of U.S. citizens while many others support it when it is
   done by the Obama administration.^[120]

   Some Democratic officeholders have championed consumer protection laws
   that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most
   Democrats oppose sodomy laws and believe that government should not
   regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a
   matter of personal privacy.^[121]

Torture

   Many Democrats are opposed to the use of torture against individuals
   apprehended and held prisoner by the U.S. military, and hold that
   categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the
   U.S. from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions. Democrats
   contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral
   standing in the world, and produces questionable results. Democrats
   largely spoke out against waterboarding.^[citation needed]

   Torture became a very divisive issue in the party after Barack Obama
   was elected president. With many centrist Democrats and members of the
   party's leadership supporting the use of torture while the liberal
   wings continued to be steadfastly opposed to it.^[122]

Foreign policy issues

Invasion of Afghanistan

   See also: Afghanistan – United States relations and International
   public opinion on the war in Afghanistan

   Democrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate
   near-unanimously voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force
   Against Terrorists against "those responsible for the recent attacks
   launched against the United States" in Afghanistan in 2001, supporting
   the NATO coalition invasion of the nation. Most elected Democrats
   continue to support the Afghanistan conflict, and some, such as a
   Democratic National Committee spokesperson, have voiced concerns that
   the Iraq War shifted too many resources away from the presence in
   Afghanistan.^[123]^[124]^[125] Since 2006, Democratic candidate Barack
   Obama has called for a "surge" of troops into Afghanistan and, since
   2008, Republican candidate John McCain has also called for a
   "surge".^[125] As President, Obama sent a "surge" force of additional
   troops to Afghanistan. Troop levels were 94,000 in December 2011, and
   are falling, with a target of 68,000 by fall 2012. Obama plans to bring
   all the troops home by 2014.^[126]

   Support for the war among the American people has diminished over time,
   and many Democrats have changed their opinion and now oppose a
   continuation of the conflict.^[127]^[128] In July 2008, Gallup found
   that 41% of Democrats called the invasion a "mistake" while a 55%
   majority disagreed; in contrast, Republicans were more supportive of
   the war. The survey described Democrats as evenly divided about whether
   or not more troops should be sent—56% support it if it would mean
   removing troops from Iraq and only 47% support it otherwise.^[128] A
   CNN survey in August 2009 stated that a majority of Democrats now
   oppose the war. CNN polling director Keating Holland said, "Nearly two
   thirds of Republicans support the war in Afghanistan. Three quarters of
   Democrats oppose the war."^[127] An August 2009 Washington Post poll
   found similar results, and the paper stated that Obama's policies would
   anger his closest supporters.^[129]

Iran sanctions

   The Democratic Party has been very skeptical of Iran and has supported
   ending the Iranian nuclear weapon program. In 2013 the Democratic led
   administration reached a diplomatic agreement with the government of
   Iran to halt the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for economic
   sanction relief. As of 2014 the agreemant has been successful and the
   Democratic party has called for more cooperation with Iran in the
   future.^[130]^[131]

Iraq War

   See also: Iraq War

   In 2002, Congressional Democrats were divided on the Authorization for
   Use of Military Force Against Iraq; 147 voted against it (21 in the
   Senate and 126 in the House) and 110 voted for it (29 in the Senate, 81
   in the House). Since then, many prominent Democrats, such as former
   Senator John Edwards, have expressed regret about this decision, and
   have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator Hillary Clinton
   have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial
   vote for it (though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance
   during the 2008 primaries). Referring to Iraq, in April 2007 Senate
   Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the war to be "lost" while other
   Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle)
   accused the President of lying to the public about WMDs in Iraq.
   Amongst lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal opponents of Operation
   Iraqi Freedom and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the
   2006 mid-term elections.

   A March 2003 CBS News poll taken a few days before the invasion of Iraq
   found that 34% of Democrats nationwide would support it without United
   Nations backing, 51% would support it only with its backing, and 14%
   would not support it at all.^[132] The Los Angeles Times stated in
   early April 2003 that 70% of Democrats supported the decision to invade
   while 27% opposed it.^[133] The Pew Research Center stated in August
   2007 that opposition increased from 37% during the initial invasion to
   74%.^[134] In April 2008, a CBS News poll found that about 90% of
   Democrats disapprove of the Bush administration's conduct and want to
   end the war within the next year.^[135]

   Democrats in the House of Representatives near-unanimously supported a
   non-binding resolution disapproving of President Bush's decision to
   send additional troops into Iraq in 2007. Congressional Democrats
   overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation that included a
   provision that set "a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat
   troops from Iraq" by March 31, 2008, but also would leave combat forces
   in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter-terrorism
   operations.^[136]^[137] After a veto from the president, and a failed
   attempt in Congress to override the veto,^[138] the U.S. Troop
   Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability
   Appropriations Act, 2007 was passed by Congress and signed by the
   president after the timetable was dropped. Criticism of the Iraq War
   subsided after the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 led to a dramatic
   decrease in Iraqi violence. The Democratic-controlled 110th Congress
   continued to fund efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Presidential
   candidate Barack Obama advocated a withdrawal of combat troops within
   Iraq by late 2010 with a residual force of peacekeeping troops left in
   place.^[139] He stated that both the speed of withdrawal and the amount
   of troops left over would be "entirely conditions-based."^[139]

   On February 27, 2009, President Obama announced, “As a candidate for
   president, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry
   out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military
   commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains
   we’ve made and protect our troops ... Those consultations are now
   complete, and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat
   brigades over the next 18 months."^[140] Around 50,000 non-combat
   related forces will remain.^[140] Obama's plan drew wide bipartisan
   support, including that of defeated Republican Presidential candidate
   Senator John McCain.^[140]

Israel

   See also: Israel – United States relations

   The Democratic Party has both recently and historically supported
   Israel.^[141]^[142] Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in 2009,
   “When it comes to Israel, Republicans and Democrats speak with one
   voice.”^[143] A 2008 Gallup poll found that 64% say that they have a
   favorable image of Israel while only 16% say that they have a favorable
   image of the Palestinian Authority.^[141] Democratic National Committee
   chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that the perception of a
   split within the party on the topic of Israel is unfounded.^[144]
   Within the party, the majority view is held by the Democratic
   leadership although some members such as John Conyers Jr., George
   Miller, Nick Rahall, Dave Obey, Pete Stark, Dennis Kucinich, and Jim
   McDermott as well as former President Jimmy Carter are less or not
   supportive of Israel.^[142] The party leadership refers to the few
   Democrats unsympathetic to Israel as a "fringe".^[142]

   The 2008 Democratic Party Platform acknowledges a "special relationship
   with Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a
   clear, strong, fundamental commitment to the security of Israel, our
   strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." It
   also included:

     It is in the best interests of all parties, including the United
     States, that we take an active role to

     help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
     with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in
     peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To
     do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners
     who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek
     conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who
     seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners
     should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism,
     recognizes Israel’s right to exist, and abides by past agreements.
     Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require
     patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the
     United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final
     status negotiations, together with an international compensation
     mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by
     allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. All understand
     that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status
     negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines
     of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The
     parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for
     final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city
     accessible to people of all faiths.^[145]

   A January 2009 Pew Research Center study found that, when asked "which
   side do you sympathize with more", 42% of Democrats and 33% of liberals
   (a plurality in both groups) sympathize most with the Israelis. Around
   half of all political moderates and/or independents sided with
   Israel.^[146]

Political status of Puerto Rico

   Main article: Political status of Puerto Rico

   The Democratic Party has expressed its support for the U.S. citizens of
   Puerto Rico to exercise their right to
   self-determination.^[102]^[147]^[148]^[149]

Russia

   See also: Russia–United States relations

   The party pursues a Russia policy that recognizes that country’s
   importance and advances the core U.S. security interests at stake in
   Russia’s historic transformation, beginning with cooperative work to
   secure vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials. The
   party has also urged more diplomacy and a following of international
   law between Russia and its neighbor states.^[150]

Voter base

   Self-identified Democrats (blue) versus self-identified Republicans
   (red) (January–June 2010 data).

Professionals

   Professionals, those who have a college education and whose work
   revolves around the conceptualization of ideas, have supported the
   Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and
   2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12-percentage point margin.
   While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican
   Party, it has become increasingly split between the two parties,
   leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for
   Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the
   prevalence of social liberal values among this group.^[151]
   “ Professionals, who are, roughly speaking, college-educated producers
     of services and ideas, used to be the most staunchly Republican of all
     occupational groups ... now chiefly working for large corporations and
     bureaucracies rather than on their own, and heavily influenced by the
     environmental, civil-rights, and feminist movements — began to vote
     Democratic. In the four elections from 1988 to 2000, they backed
     Democrats by an average of 52 percent to 40 percent.                  ”

   A study on the political attitudes of medical students, for example,
   found that "U.S. medical students are considerably more likely to be
   liberal than conservative and are more likely to be liberal than are
   other young U.S. adults. Future U.S. physicians may be more receptive
   to liberal messages than current ones, and their political orientation
   may profoundly affect their health system attitudes."^[152] Similar
   results are found for professors, who are more strongly inclined
   towards liberalism and the Democratic Party than other occupational
   groups.^[42] The Democratic Party also has strong support among
   scientists, with 55% identifying as Democrats, 32% as Independents, and
   6% as Republicans and 52% identifying as liberal, 35% as moderate, and
   9% as conservative.^[153]

Academia

   See also: Higher education in the United States

   Academics, intellectuals, and the highly educated overall constitute an
   important part of the Democratic voter base. Academia in particular
   tends to be progressive. In a 2005 survey, nearly 72% of full-time
   faculty members identified as liberal, while 15% identified as
   conservative. The social sciences and humanities were the most liberal
   disciplines while business was the most conservative. Male professors
   at more advanced stages of their careers as well as those at elite
   institutions tend be the most liberal.^[42] Another survey by UCLA
   conducted in 2001/02, found 47.6% of scholars identifying as liberal,
   34.3% as moderate, and 18% as conservative.^[154] Percentages of
   professors who identified as liberal ranged from 49% in business to
   over 80% in political science and the humanities.^[42] Social
   scientists, such as Brett O'Bannon of DePauw University, have claimed
   that the "liberal" opinions of professors seem to have little, if any,
   effect on the political orientation of students.^[155]^[156] As of July
   2008 the Students for Academic Freedom arm of the David Horowitz
   Freedom Center, a conservative organization, posted a list of 440
   student complaints, most of which pertain to perceived liberal bias of
   college professors.

   Those with graduate education, have become increasingly Democratic
   beginning in the 1992,^[157] 1996,^[157] 2000,^[34] 2004,^[35] and
   2008^[158] elections. Intellectualism, the tendency to constantly
   reexamine issues, or in the words of Edwards Shields, the "penetration
   beyond the screen of immediate concrete experience," has also been
   named as an explanation why academia is strongly democratic and
   liberal.^[159]^[160]

   In the past, a self-identified Republican was more likely to have a
   4-year college degree; however, according to some recent surveys,
   similar percentages of Republicans and Democrats are likely to have
   4-year college degrees, and Democrats are more likely to hold
   post-graduate degrees.^[161]

   An analysis of 2008 through 2012 survey data from the General Social
   Survey, the National Election Studies, and the Pew Research Center for
   the People and the Press led to a slightly different assessment of the
   overall educational status of self-identified Democrats and
   Republicans:

     On average, self-identified Republicans have more years of education
     (4 to 8 months each, depending on the survey) and are probably more
     likely to hold, at the least, a 4-year college degree. (One major
     survey indicates that they are more likely, while the results of
     another survey are statistically insignificant.) It also appears
     that Republicans continue to out-test Democrats in surveys that
     assess political knowledge and/or current events. With respect to
     post-graduate studies, the educational advantage is shifting towards
     self-identified Democrats. They are now more likely to hold
     post-graduate college degrees. (One major survey indicates that they
     are more likely, while the results of another survey are
     statistically insignificant.)^[162]

Youth

   Studies have shown that younger voters tend to vote mostly for
   Democratic candidates in recent years. Despite supporting Ronald Reagan
   and George H. W. Bush, the young have voted in favor of the Democratic
   presidential candidate in every election since Bill Clinton in 1992,
   and are more likely to identify as liberals than the general
   population.^[163] In the 2004 presidential election, Democratic
   presidential candidate John Kerry received 54% of the vote from voters
   of the age group 18–29, while Republican George W. Bush received 45% of
   the vote from the same age group. In the 2006 midterm elections, the
   Democrats received 60% of the vote from the same age group.^[35]^[36]
   Polls suggest that younger voters tend to be more liberal than the
   general population and have more liberal views than the public on
   same-sex marriage and universal healthcare, helping Barack Obama carry
   66% of their votes in 2008. The Young Democrats of America are an
   affiliated organization of members of the party younger than 36 that
   advocates for youth issues and works for youth voter turnout.

Labor

   Fig 109 - does someone in house belong to union.JPG

   Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition
   has been organized labor. Labor unions supply a great deal of the
   money, grass roots political organization, and voting base of support
   for the party. Democrats are far more likely to be represented by
   unions, although union membership has declined, in general, during the
   last few decades. This trend is depicted in the following graph from
   the book, Democrats and Republicans — Rhetoric and Reality.^[164] It is
   based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).

   The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has
   been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and
   private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant
   labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the AFL-CIO and
   Change to Win labor federations, as well as the National Education
   Association, a large, unaffiliated teachers' union. Both the AFL-CIO
   and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for
   2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Other important issues
   for labor unions include supporting industrial policy (including
   protectionism) that sustains unionized manufacturing jobs, raising the
   minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social
   Security and universal health care.

Working class

   Further information: Social class in the United States

   While the American working class has lost much of its political
   strength with the decline of labor unions,^[165] it remains a
   stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues as an essential part
   of the Democratic base. Today, roughly a third of the American public
   is estimated to be working class with around 52% being either members
   of the working or lower classes.^[166]^[167] Yet, as those with lower
   socioeconomic status are less likely to vote, the working and lower
   classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is
   largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work.
   It consists mainly of clerical and blue-collar workers.^[166] Even
   though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate
   standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal
   benefit from an extended social safety net, make the majority of
   working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working
   class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more
   socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more
   religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially
   conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated
   and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a
   college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of
   liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the
   financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic
   base.^[41] The continued importance of the working class votes
   manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the
   majority of those with low incomes and little education vote for the
   Democratic Party.^[34]^[35]^[36]

Women

   election

   Although the "gender gap" has varied over many years, women of all ages
   are more likely than men to identify as Democrats. Recent polls have
   indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of
   women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men
   identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents.
   Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to
   identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single,
   living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are
   more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in
   contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between
   Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are
   significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote
   Democratic.^[168] The National Federation of Democratic Women is an
   affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. National
   women's organizations that often support Democratic candidates are
   Emily's List and the National Organization for Women.

Relation to marital status and parenthood

   Americans that identify as single, living with a domestic partner,
   divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely to vote Democratic, in
   contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between
   Democrat and Republican.^[168]

   GSS surveys of more than 11,000 Democrats and Republicans conducted
   between 1996 and 2006 came to the result that the differences in
   fertility rates are not statistically significant between these
   parties, with the average Democrat having 1.94 children and the average
   Republican having 1.91 children.^[169] However, there is a significant
   difference in fertility rates between the two related groups liberals
   and conservatives, with liberals reproducing at a much lower rate than
   conservatives.^[169]

LGBT Americans

   CAPTION: LGBT votes for Democratic presidential candidates

   Year^[170]^[171]  Candidate   Vote
   1996             Bill Clinton 71%
   2000             Al Gore      70%
   2004             John Kerry   77%
   2008             Barack Obama 70%
   2012             Barack Obama 76%

   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans typically vote
   Democratic in national elections within the 70-77% range, according to
   national media exit polling. In heavily gay precincts in large cities
   across the nation, the average was higher, ranging from 85-94%. This
   trend has continued since 1996 when Bill Clinton won 71% of the LGBT
   vote compared to Bob Dole's 16% and 13% for others. In 2000 Al Gore won
   70% to George W. Bush's 25% with 5% for others, in 2004 John Kerry won
   77% to George W. Bush's 23%, in 2008 Barack Obama won 70% to John
   McCain's 27% with 3% to others and in 2012 Barack Obama won 76% to Mitt
   Romney's 22% with 2% to others. Patrick Egan, a professor of politics
   at New York University specializing in LGBT voting patterns, calls this
   a "remarkable continuity." Saying "about three-fourths vote Democratic
   and one-fourth Republican from year to year."^[170] Notable LGBT
   Democrats include current Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and
   current Representatives Jared Polis of Colorado and David Cicilline of
   Rhode Island. The late activist and San Francisco Supervisor Harvey
   Milk was a Democrat as is former Representative Barney Frank of
   Massachusetts. The National Stonewall Democrats is an LGBT advocacy
   group associated with the Democratic Party. The LGBT Equality Caucus is
   a congressional caucus of 97 Democrats and 3 Republicans that work and
   advocate for LGBT rights within the House of Representatives.^[172]

Black Americans

   Bill Clinton at a Democratic "Get out the vote" rally in Los Angeles

   From the end of the Civil War, African Americans primarily favored the
   Republican Party due to its overwhelming political and more tangible
   efforts in achieving abolition, particularly through President
   Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.^[173] The south had long been a
   Democratic stronghold, favoring a state's right to legal slavery. In
   addition, the ranks of the fledgling Ku Klux Klan were composed almost
   entirely of white Democrats angry over poor treatment by northerners
   and bent on reversing the policies of Reconstruction.^[174] However,
   African Americans began drifting to the Democratic Party when Franklin
   Roosevelt was elected president.^[173] Support for the Civil Rights
   Movement in the 1960s by Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy and
   Lyndon B. Johnson helped give the Democrats even larger support among
   the African-American community, which consistently vote between 85-95%
   Democratic.^[173]

   Prominent modern-day African-American Democratic politicians include
   Jim Clyburn, Ed Towns, Elijah Cummings, Maxine Waters, John Lewis,
   Deval Patrick, Charles Rangel, John Conyers, and the current President
   of the United States, Barack Obama, who managed to net over 95% of the
   African-American vote in the 2008 election.^[175] Despite being
   unaffiliated, the NAACP often participates in organizing and voter
   turnout drives and advocates for progressive causes, especially those
   that affect people of color.^[176] Within the House of Representatives,
   the Congressional Black Caucus, consisting of 44 black Democrats,
   serves to represent the interests of African Americans and advocate on
   issues that affect them.

Hispanic and Latino Americans

   The Hispanic population, particularly the large Mexican American
   population in the Southwest and the large Puerto Rican and Dominican
   populations in the Northeast, have been strong supporters of the
   Democratic Party. In the 1996 presidential election, Democratic
   President Bill Clinton received 72% of the Hispanic vote.^[177] In
   following years, however, the Republican Party gained increasing
   support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic
   Protestants and Pentecostals. With his much more liberal views on
   immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain
   40% of the Hispanic vote (he did so in the 2004 presidential election).
   Yet the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the 2006
   midterm elections, dropping from 44% to 30%, with the Democrats gaining
   in the Hispanic vote from 55% in 2004 to 69% in 2006.^[35]^[36]
   Democrats increased their share of the Hispanic vote in the 2008
   presidential election, with Barack Obama receiving 67%. According to
   exit polls by Edison Research, Obama increased his support again in
   2012, winning 71% of Hispanic voters.^[178]

   Cuban Americans still tend to vote Republican, though there has been a
   noticeable change starting with the 2008 elections. During the 2008
   elections Barack Obama received 47% of the Cuban American vote in
   Florida.^[179] According to Bendixen's exit polls, 84% of Miami-Dade
   Cuban American voters 65 or older backed McCain, while 55% of those 29
   or younger backed Obama,^[180] showing that the younger Cuban-American
   generation has become more liberal.

   Throughout the decade of the 2000s, 60% or more of Hispanic Roman
   Catholics who were registered to vote identified as either Democratic
   or leaning towards the Party.^[181]

   Unaffiliated Hispanic advocacy groups that often support progressive
   candidates and causes include the National Council of La Raza and the
   League of United Latin American Citizens. In the House of
   Representatives, the Democratic caucus of Hispanic Americans is the
   Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Native Americans

   The Democratic Party also has strong support among the Native American
   population, particularly in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota,
   South Dakota, Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and
   North Carolina. Though now a small percentage of the population
   (virtually non-existent in some regions), most Native American
   precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by
   African-Americans.^[182]

Jewish Americans

   See also: National Jewish Democratic Council

   Jewish American communities tend to be a stronghold for the Democratic
   Party, with more than 70% of Jewish voters having cast their ballots
   for the Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections.^[35]^[36] Al Gore
   received 79% of the Jewish votes in 2000, and Barack Obama won about
   77% of the Jewish vote in 2008.^[183] Support tends to vary among
   specific sectarian groups. For example, only 13% of Orthodox Jews
   supported Barack Obama in 2008 while around 60% of Conservative Jews
   and Reform Jews did so.^[184] A 2010 poll by the Pew Research Center
   found that 60% of self-described Jews identified as Democratic or
   leaning towards the party, compared to 33% with those feelings towards
   Republicans.^[181]

   Jews as an important Democratic constituency are especially politically
   active and influential in large cities such as New York City, Los
   Angeles, Boston, Chicago; and play critical roles in large cities
   within presidential swing states, such as Philadelphia, Miami, and Las
   Vegas. Many prominent national Democrats in recent decades have been
   Jewish, including Chuck Schumer, Abraham Ribicoff, Henry Waxman, Martin
   Frost, Joseph Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Barney Frank, Barbara Boxer,
   Paul Wellstone, Rahm Emanuel, Russ Feingold, Herb Kohl, and Howard
   Metzenbaum.^[184]

Arab and Muslim Americans

   Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have leaned Democratic since the
   Iraq War.^[185] Zogby found in June 2007 that 39% of Arab Americans
   identify as Democrats, 26% as Republicans, and 28% as
   independents.^[185]

   Arab Americans, generally socially conservative but with more diverse
   economic views, historically voted Republican until recent years,
   having supported George W. Bush over Al Gore in 2000.^[186]

   The 2012 poll found that 68% of Muslim Americans surveyed support
   Barack Obama.^[187]

Asian Americans

   The Democratic Party also has strong support in the small but growing
   Asian American population. The Asian American population had been a
   stronghold of the Republican Party through the United States
   presidential election of 1992 in which George H. W. Bush won 55% of the
   Asian American vote, compared to Bill Clinton winning 31%, and Ross
   Perot winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of
   Asian Americans consisted of anti-communist Vietnamese refugees,
   Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, and socially conservative
   Filipinos who fled Ferdinand Marcos in the 1960s through the 1980s. The
   Democratic party made gains among the Asian American population
   starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian American vote.
   Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that
   Democratic candidate, Barack Obama won 62% of the Asian American vote
   nationwide.^[188] In the 2012 Presidential election, 73% of the Asian
   American electorate voted for Obama's re-election.^[189] This is due to
   demographic shifts in the Asian American community, with growing
   numbers of well educated Chinese and Asian Indian immigrants that are
   typically economic centrist and social progressives.

   Barack Obama has the support of 85% of Indian Americans, 68% of Chinese
   Americans, and 57% of Filipino Americans.^[190] The Asian American
   community's increasing number of young voters has also helped to erode
   traditionally reliably Republican voting blocs such as Vietnamese and
   Filipino Americans, leading to an increase in support for Democrats.
   Prominent Asian-American Democrats include Senators Daniel Inouye,
   Daniel Akaka and Mazie Hirono, former Governor and Secretary of
   Commerce Gary Locke, and Representatives Mike Honda, Judy Chu, Doris
   Matsui, and Norman Mineta.

       osner.html One problem is attributable to Obama, though it is not a
       fault of Obama. "Obama resembles such Presidents as Nixon and
       Clinton in the following respect. They are what the political
       scientist Stephen Skowronek calls practitioners of “third way”
       politics (Tony Blair was another), who undermine the opposition by
       borrowing policies from it in an effort to seize the middle and
       with it to achieve political dominance. Think of Nixon’s economic
       policies, which were a continuation of Johnson’s “Great Society”;
       Clinton’s welfare reform and support of capital punishment; and
       Obama’s pragmatic centrism, reflected in his embrace, albeit very
       recent, of entitlements reform. The resemblance between Nixon and
       Obama is, surprising as this may seem, particularly close. Nixon
       was a bête noir of the Left and Obama is a bête noir of the Right,
       in both cases based on their activities before they became
       President (Nixon’s red-baiting, Obama’s community organizing). But
       Nixon as President was, and Obama is (or is willing to be, under
       political pressure), a centrist President. That infuriates the
       opposition by stealing its thunder, and so provokes a powerful
       reaction. For the Republicans to have acceded to the Obama-Bohner
       plan of heavy spending cuts and light tax increases would have
       conceded the political middle to Obama." 2014-08-12;
