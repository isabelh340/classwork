   The National Guard of the United States, part of the reserve components
   of the United States Armed Forces, is a reserve military force,
   composed of National Guard military members or units of each state and
   the territories of Guam, of the Virgin Islands, and of Puerto Rico, as
   well as of the District of Columbia, for a total of 54 separate
   organizations. All members of the National Guard of the United States
   are also members of the militia of the United States as defined by 10
   U.S.C. § 311. The majority of National Guard soldiers and airmen hold a
   civilian job full-time while serving part-time as a National Guard
   member.^[1]^[2] These part-time guardsmen are augmented by a full-time
   cadre of Active Guard & Reserve (AGR) personnel in both the Army
   National Guard and Air National Guard, plus Army Reserve Technicians in
   the Army National Guard and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) in the Air
   National Guard.

   The National Guard is a joint activity of the United States Department
   of Defense (DoD) composed of reserve components of the United States
   Army and the United States Air Force: the Army National Guard of the
   United States^[1] and the Air National Guard of the United States
   respectively.^[1]

Origins[edit]

   From its founding years in the 1700s through the early 1900s, the
   United States maintained only a minimal army and relied on state
   militias to supply the majority of its troops.^[3] As a result of the
   Spanish-American War, Congress was called upon to reform and regulate
   the training and qualification of state militias. In 1903, with passage
   of the Dick Act, the predecessor to the modern-day National Guard was
   formed. It required the states to divide their militias into two
   sections. The law recommended the title "National Guard" for the first
   section, known as the organized militia, and "Reserve Militia" for all
   others.^[4]

   During World War I, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916,
   which required the use of the term "National Guard" for the state
   militias and further regulated them. Congress also authorized the
   states to maintain Home Guards, which were reserve forces outside the
   National Guards being deployed by the Federal Government.^[5]

   In 1933, with passage of the National Guard Mobilization Act, Congress
   finalized the split between the National Guard and the traditional
   state militias by mandating that all federally funded soldiers take a
   dual enlistment/commission and thus enter both the state National Guard
   and the National Guard of the United States, a newly created federal
   reserve force.

   The National Defense Act of 1947 created the Air Force as a separate
   branch of the Armed Forces and concurrently created the Air National
   Guard of the United States as one of its reserve components, mirroring
   the Army's structure.

Organization[edit]

   The National Guard of the several states, territories, and the District
   of Columbia serves as part of the first-line of defense for the United
   States.^[6] The state National Guard is organized into units stationed
   in each of the 50 states and US territories, and operates under their
   respective state or territorial governor The governors exercise control
   through the state adjutants general.^[7] The National Guard may be
   called up for active duty by the governors to help respond to domestic
   emergencies and disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and
   earthquakes.^[7]

   The National Guard is administered by the National Guard Bureau, which
   is a joint activity of the Army and Air Force under the
   DoD.^[8]^[9]^[10] The National Guard Bureau provides a communication
   channel for state National Guards to the DoD.^[11] The National Guard
   Bureau also provides policies and requirements for training and funds
   for state Army National Guard and state Air National Guard units,^[12]
   the allocation of federal funds to the Army National Guard and the Air
   National Guard,^[12] as well as other administrative responsibilities
   prescribed under 10 U.S.C. § 10503. The National Guard Bureau is headed
   by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB), who is a four-star
   general^[8]^[9] in the Army or Air Force and is a member of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff.

   Both the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are expected to
   adhere to the same moral and physical standards as their "full-time"
   active duty and "part-time" reserve federal counterparts. The same
   ranks and insignia of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are used by the
   Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, respectively, and
   National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military
   awards. The respective state National Guards also bestow state awards
   for services rendered both at home and abroad. Under Army and Air Force
   regulations, these awards may be worn while on state active duty or
   while on Title 32 federal activation. Regular Army and Army Reserve
   soldiers are also authorized to accept these awards, but are not
   authorized to wear them.

Constitutional basis[edit]

   National Guardsmen, Penn Station, New York City

   The respective state National Guards are authorized by the Constitution
   of the United States. As originally drafted, the Constitution
   recognized the existing state militias, and gave them vital roles to
   fill: "to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and
   repel Invasion." (Article I, Section 8, Clause 15). The Constitution
   distinguished "militias," which were state entities, from "Troops",
   which were unlawful for states to maintain without Congressional
   approval. (Article I, Section 10, Clause 3). Under current law, the
   respective state National Guards and the State Defense Forces are
   authorized by Congress to the states and are referred to as "troops."
   32 U.S.C. § 109.

   Although originally state entities, the Constitutional "Militia of the
   Several States" were not entirely independent because they could be
   federalized. According to Article I, Section 8; Clause 15, the United
   States Congress is given the power to pass laws for "calling forth the
   Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and
   repel Invasions." Congress is also empowered to come up with the
   guidelines "for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and
   for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of
   the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the
   Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia
   according to the discipline prescribed by Congress" (clause 16). The
   President of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the state
   militias "when called into the actual Service of the United States."
   (Article II, Section 2).

   The traditional state militias were redefined and recreated as the
   "organized militia"—the National Guard, via the Militia Act of 1903.
   They were now subject to an increasing amount of federal control,
   including having arms and accouterments supplied by the central
   government, federal funding, and numerous closer ties to the Regular
   Army.

Other Organizations[edit]

State Defense Forces[edit]

   Many states also maintain their own state defense forces. Although not
   federal entities like the National Guard of the United States, these
   forces are components of the state militias like the individual state
   National Guards.

   These forces were created by Congress in 1917 as a result of the state
   National Guards' being deployed and were known as Home Guards. In 1940,
   with the onset of World War II and as a result of its federalizing the
   National Guard, Congress amended the National Defense Act of 1916, and
   authorized the states to maintain "military forces other than National
   Guard."^[13] This law authorized the War Department to train and arm
   the new military forces that would come to be known as State Guards. In
   1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War and at the urging of the
   National Guard, Congress reauthorized the separate state military
   forces for a time period of two years. These state military forces were
   authorized military training at federal expense, as well as "arms,
   ammunition, clothing, and equipment," as deemed necessary by the
   Secretary of the Army.^[14] In 1956, Congress finally revised the law
   and authorized "State defense forces" permanently under Title 32,
   Section 109, of the United States Code.^[15]

Naval Militias[edit]

   Although there are no Naval or Marine Corps components of the National
   Guard of the United States, there is a Naval Militia authorized under
   federal law.10 U.S.C. § 7851. Like the soldiers and airmen in the
   National Guard of the United States, members of the Naval Militia are
   authorized federal appointments or enlistments at the discretion of the
   Secretary of the Navy.10 U.S.C. § 7852. To receive federal funding and
   equipment, a state naval militia must be composed of at least 95%
   Marine or Naval reservists. As such, some states maintain such units.
   Some states also maintain naval components of their State Defense
   Force. Recently, Alaska, California, New Jersey, New York, South
   Carolina, Texas and Ohio have had or currently maintain naval militias.
   Other states have laws authorizing them but do not currently have them
   organized. To receive federal funding, just like with the National
   Guard, a state must meet specific requirements such as having a set
   percentage of its members in the federal reserves.10 U.S.C. § 7851.

Duties and administrative organization[edit]

   Seal of the National Guard Bureau. 2013 revision.

   National Guard units can be mobilized for federal active duty to
   supplement regular armed forces during times of war or national
   emergency declared by Congress,^[16] the President^[16] or the
   Secretary of Defense.^[17] They can also be activated for service in
   their respective states upon declaration of a state of emergency by the
   governor of the state or territory in which they serve, or in the case
   of Washington, D.C., by the Commanding General. Unlike Army Reserve
   members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually,
   except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments
   (TDY).

   The National Guard Bureau is in Arlington, Virginia, and is a joint
   activity of the Department of Defense to conduct all the administrative
   matters pertaining to the Army National Guard and the Air National
   Guard. The current chief of the National Guard Bureau is General Frank
   J. Grass. The chief is either an Air Force or an Army 4-star general
   (flag) officer, is the senior uniformed National Guard officer, and is
   a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this capacity, he serves as a
   military adviser to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the
   National Security Council and is the Department of Defense's official
   channel of communication to the Governors and to State Adjutants
   General on all matters pertaining to the National Guard. He is
   responsible for ensuring that the more than half a million Army and Air
   National Guard personnel are accessible, capable, and ready to protect
   the homeland and to provide combat resources to the Army and the Air
   Force. He is appointed by the President in his capacity as Commander in
   Chief.^[18]

National Guard Active Duty Character[edit]

   The term "activated" simply means that a unit or individual of the
   reserve components has been placed on orders. The purpose and authority
   for that activation will determine limitations and duration of the
   activation. The Army and Air National Guard may be activated in a
   number of ways as prescribed by public law. Broadly, under federal law,
   there are two titles in the United State Code under which units and
   troops may be activated: as federal soldiers or airmen under Title 10
   ("Armed Forces") and as state soldiers or airmen performing a federally
   funded mission under Title 32 ("National Guard").^[19] Outside federal
   activation, the Army and Air National Guard may be activated under
   state law. This is known as state active duty (SAD).

State Duty[edit]

   When National Guard units are not under federal control, the governor
   is the commander-in-chief of the units of his or her respective state
   or territory (such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands). The
   President of the United States commands the District of Columbia
   National Guard, though this command is routinely delegated to the
   Commanding General of the DC National Guard.^[19] States are free to
   employ their National Guard forces under state control for state
   purposes and at state expense as provided in the state's constitution
   and statutes. In doing so, governors, as commanders-in-chief, can
   directly access and utilize the Guard's federally assigned aircraft,
   vehicles and other equipment so long as the federal government is
   reimbursed for the use of fungible equipment and supplies such as fuel,
   food stocks, etc. This is the authority under which governors activate
   and deploy National Guard forces in response to natural disasters. It
   is also the authority under which governors deploy National Guard
   forces in response to man-made emergencies such as riots and civil
   unrest, or terrorist attacks.^[20]
     * The Governor can activate National Guard personnel to "State Active
       Duty" in response to natural or man-made disasters or Homeland
       Defense missions. State Active Duty is based on State statute and
       policy as well as State funds. Soldiers and Airmen remain under the
       command and control of the Governor. The federal Posse Comitatus
       Act (PCA) does not apply under state active duty status or Title 32
       status.
     * Title 32 Full-Time National Guard Duty. (Federally funded, but
       command and control remains with the State Governor through his
       Adjutant General.) Title 32 activation can only be done by the
       President or SECDEF with the approval and consent of the state
       Governor.

   The most common duty for National Guard personnel is Inactive Duty for
   Training (IDT). This is the traditional weekend a month and two week
   summer training periods.

Federal Duty[edit]

   Title 10, service means full-time duty in the active military service
   of the United States. The term used is federalized. Federalized
   National Guard forces have been ordered, by the President to active
   duty either in their reserve component status or by calling them into
   Federal service in their militia status.^[19] There are several forms:
     * Voluntary Order to Active Duty.

          Federalized with the Soldier's or Airman's consent and the
          consent of their Governor.

     * Partial Mobilization.

          In time of national emergency declared by the President for any
          unit or any member for not more than 24 consecutive months.

     * Presidential Reserve Call Up.

          When the President determines that it is necessary to augment
          the active forces for any operational mission for any unit or
          any member for not more than 270 days.

     * Federal Aid for State Governments.

          Whenever an insurrection occurs in any State against its
          government, the President may, upon the request of its
          legislature or of its governor call into Federal service such of
          the militia of the other States. This is a statutory exception
          to the PCA

     * Use of Militia and Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority.

          Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions,
          assemblages, or rebellion make it impracticable to enforce the
          laws of the United States in any State or Territory, he may call
          into Federal service such of the militia of any State. This is
          another statutory exception to the PCA

     * Interference with State and Federal law.

          The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or
          both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he
          considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection,
          domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.

     * Air and Army National Guard.

          Air and Army National Guard can specifically be called into
          Federal service in case of invasion, rebellion, or inability to
          execute Federal law with active forces.

   In the categories listed above, Army and Air National Guard units or
   individuals may also be mobilized for non-combat purposes such as the
   State Partnership Program, humanitarian missions, counterdrug
   operations, and peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions.^[19]

History[edit]

Early history[edit]

   First Muster, Spring 1637, Massachusetts Bay Colony.

   The claim that the National Guard is older than the nation itself, with
   over three and a half centuries of service, is based on the claim that
   the modern-day 101st Field Artillery Regiment, 182nd Infantry Regiment,
   101st Engineer Battalion and 181st Infantry Regiment of the
   Massachusetts Army National Guard are directly descended from
   Massachusetts Bay Colony regiments formed over 375 years ago. On
   December 13, 1636,^[21]^[22] the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay
   Colony had ordered that the Colony's scattered militia companies be
   organized into North, South and East Regiments—with a goal of
   increasing the militias' accountability to the colonial government,
   efficacy, and responsiveness in conflicts with indigenous Pequot
   Indians. Under this act, white males between the ages of 16 and 60 were
   obligated to possess arms and to take part in the defense of their
   communities by serving in nightly guard details and participating in
   weekly drills. As the British Colonies developed, colonial militias
   would develop out of this tradition. The Massachusetts militia began
   the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and
   Concord,^[23] and provided the majority of soldiers during the course
   of the war.

   The early United States distrusted a standing army, and kept the number
   of professional soldiers small. During the Northwest Indian War, the
   majority of soldiers were provided by state militias. There are
   nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of
   1812.

   The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the U.S., in 1824–25, was in
   every sense a triumphal procession. The 2nd Battalion, 11th New York
   Artillery, was one of many militia commands who turned out in welcome.
   This unit decided to adopt the title "National Guard," in honor of
   Lafayette's celebrated Garde Nationale de Paris. The Battalion, later
   the 7th Regiment, was prominent in the line of march on the occasion of
   Lafayette's final passage through New York en route home to France.
   Taking note of the troops named for his old command, Lafayette alighted
   from his carriage, walked down the line, clasping each officer by the
   hand as he passed. "National Guard" was destined to become the name of
   the U.S. militia.

   Militia units provided 70% of the soldiers that fought in the
   Mexican–American War,^[23] and also provided the majority of soldiers
   in the early months of the American Civil War^[24] The majority of
   soldiers in the Spanish–American War were from the National Guard.^[23]

Industrialization and labor unrest[edit]

   Labor unrest in the industrial and mining sections of the Northeast and
   Midwest led to demands for a stronger military force within the states.
   After the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, calls for military suppression
   of labor strikes grew louder, and National Guard units proliferated. In
   many states, large and elaborate armories, often built to resemble
   medieval castles, were constructed to house militia units. Businessmen
   and business associations donated monies for the construction of
   armories and to supplement funds of the local National Guard units.
   National Guard officers also came from the middle and upper
   classes.^[25] National Guard troops were deployed to suppress strikers
   in some of the bloodiest and most significant conflicts of the late
   19th and early 20th centuries, including the Homestead Strike, the
   Pullman Strike of 1894, and the Colorado Labor Wars.

20th century[edit]

   A National Guardsman in 1917.

   Throughout the 19th century the Regular U.S. Army was small, and the
   state militias provided the majority of the troops during the
   Mexican-American War, the start of the American Civil War, and the
   Spanish-American War. With the Militia Act of 1903, the militia was
   more organized and the name "National Guard" recommended. In 1933, the
   state National Guards were required to join the National Guard of the
   United States, a reserve force for the U.S. Army; this is the official
   founding of the present National Guard. In World War I, National Guard
   soldiers made up 40 percent of the U.S. combat divisions in France. In
   World War II, the National Guard made up 19 divisions. One hundred
   forty thousand Guardsmen were mobilized during the Korean War and over
   63,000 for Operation Desert Storm. They have also participated in U.S.
   peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
   Bosnia, and Kosovo as well as for natural disasters, strikes, riots and
   security for the Olympic Games when they have been in the States.

   Following World War II, the National Guard aviation units that had
   previously been part of the U.S. Army Air Corps and its successor
   organization, the U.S. Army Air Forces, became the Air National Guard
   (ANG), one of two Reserve Components of the newly established United
   States Air Force.

   At this time, the National Guard consisted of 27 Divisions; 25 Infantry
   and two armored, plus scores of smaller units.
   The Kansas Army National Guard armory in Concordia, Kansas is a typical
   building used for the National Guard programs.

   On September 24, 1957 President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the
   entire Arkansas National Guard in order to ensure the safe entry of the
   Little Rock 9 to Little Rock Central High School the following day.
   Governor Orval Faubus had previously used members of the guard to deny
   the students entry to the school.

   The New York National Guard were ordered by Governor Nelson A.
   Rockefeller to respond to the Rochester 1964 race riot in July of that
   year, the first such use of the Guard in a Northern city since the
   Civil War. The California Army National Guard were mobilized by the
   Governor of California Edmund Gerald Brown, Sr. during the Watts Riots,
   in August 1965, to provide security and help restore order.
   After 1992 Los Angeles Riots 4,000 National Guard troops patrolled the
   city to enforce the law.

   Elements of the Ohio Army National Guard were ordered to Kent State
   University by Ohio's governor Jim Rhodes to quell anti-Vietnam War
   protests, culminating in their shooting into a crowd of students on May
   4, 1970, killing four and injuring nine.

   During the Vietnam War, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara created
   the Selective Reserve Force (SRF) in October 1965. Since funding was
   not available to train and equip the entire National Guard adequately,
   the SRF would be a core group of 150,000 National Guardsmen available
   and ready for immediate overseas deployment if needed. SRF units were
   supposed to be authorized at 100% strength, receive priority training
   funds and modern equipment^[26] as well as having more training and
   doing 58 hours of drills of four hours each a year rather than the
   standard 48 hours of drills.^[27]

   The 2 Battalion 138th Field Artillery of the Kentucky Army National
   Guard was ordered to service in Vietnam in late 1968. The unit served
   in support of the regular 101st Airborne Division. The Battalion's C
   Battery lost 9 men killed and thirty-two wounded when North Vietnamese
   troops overran Fire Base Tomahawk on June 19, 1969.^[28]

   During the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, when portions of south central Los
   Angeles erupted in chaos, overwhelming the Los Angeles Police
   Department's ability to contain the violence, the California Army
   National Guard and selected units of the California Air National Guard
   was mobilized to help restore order. The National Guard were attributed
   with five shootings of people suspected of violating the curfew order
   placed on the city.

   During the 1993 Waco Siege of the Branch Davidians, elements of the
   Alabama and Texas Army National Guard were called in to assist the ATF
   and the follow on effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the
   National Guard's involvement was limited to several specific areas;
   surveillance and reconnaissance, transport, maintenance and repairs,
   training and instruction, helicopters, unarmed tactical ground
   vehicles. The Army National Guard helicopters were also used to do
   photographic reconnaissance work. Training for ATF agents included such
   subjects as Close Quarters Combat, and combat medical instruction, and
   a mock up of the Mount Carmel complex was constructed at Fort Hood,
   Texas for rehearsals. ATF also received several surplus helmets, flack
   vests, canteens, first aid dressings, empty magazines, and some
   night-vision equipment, in addition to MREs and diesel fuel. The FBI
   would request and receive the use of Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicles,
   and tank retrieval vehicles, as well as overflights by UH-1 and CH-47
   helicopters.^[29]

   As a result of the Bottom Up Review and post-Cold War force cutbacks,
   the Army National Guard maneuver force was reduced to eight divisions
   (from ten; the 26th Infantry and 50th Armored were consolidated in the
   northeastern states) and fifteen 'enhanced brigades,' which were
   supposed to be ready for combat operations, augmenting the active
   force, within 90 days.^[30]

21st century[edit]

   National Guard units played a major role in providing security and
   assisting recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, in
   September 2005.

   In January and February 2007, National Guard troops from 8 states were
   activated to go help shovel snow, drop hay for starving cattle, deliver
   food and necessities to stranded people in their houses, and help
   control traffic and rescue stranded motorists in blizzards dropping
   feet of snow across the country.^[31]

   The Air National Guard has more than 106,000 personnel, and the Army
   National Guard (ARNG) around 325,000 personnel (as of February
   2006).^[citation needed]

   In 2005, National Guard members and reservists were said to comprise a
   larger percentage of frontline fighting forces than in any war in U.S.
   history (about 43 percent in Iraq and 55 percent in Afghanistan).^[32]
   There were more than 183,366 National Guard members and reservists on
   active duty nationwide who left behind about 300,000 dependents,
   according to U.S. Defense Department statistics. In 2011, Army Chief of
   Staff Gen. George W. Casey, Jr. stated that "Every Guard brigade has
   deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, and over 300,000 Guardsmen have
   deployed in this war."^[33]

   The Army National Guard is reorganizing into 28 brigade combat teams
   and 78 support brigades as a part of the Army's transformation plan.
   When the reorganization is complete, brigades will have 3,000-to-4,000
   soldiers whereas the former Army organization was principally
   structured around large, mostly mechanized, divisions of around 15,000
   soldiers each.

   In the first quarter of 2007, United States Secretary of Defense Robert
   M. Gates announced changes to the Guard deployment policy aimed at
   shorter and more predictable deployments for National Guard troops.
   "Gates said his goal is for Guard members to serve a one-year
   deployment no more than every five years... Gates is imposing a
   one-year limit to the length of deployment for National Guard Soldiers,
   effective immediately." Prior to this time, Guard troops deployed for a
   standard one-year deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan would serve for 18
   or more months including training and transit time. During the
   transition to the new policy for all troops in the pipeline, deployed
   or soon to be deployed, some will face deployments faster than every
   five years. "The one-to-five year cycle does not include activations
   for state emergencies."^[34]

After September 11, 2001[edit]

   Former Wartime Service SSI

   Prior to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001,
   the National Guard's general policy regarding mobilization was that
   Guardsmen would be required to serve no more than one year cumulative
   on active duty (with no more than six months overseas) for each five
   years of regular drill. Due to strains placed on active duty units
   following the attacks, the possible mobilization time was increased to
   18 months (with no more than one year overseas). Additional strains
   placed on military units as a result of the invasion of Iraq further
   increased the amount of time a Guardsman could be mobilized to 24
   months. Current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will
   be involuntarily activated for more than 24 months (cumulative) in one
   six-year enlistment period.^[citation needed]

   Traditionally, most National Guard personnel serve "One weekend a
   month, two weeks a year", although personnel in highly operational or
   high demand units serve far more frequently. Typical examples are
   pilots, navigators and aircrewmen in active flying assignments,
   primarily in the Air National Guard, and to a lesser extent in the Army
   National Guard, and special operations airmen and soldiers in both. A
   significant number also serve in a full-time capacity in roles such as
   Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) or Air Reserve Technician or Army
   Reserve Technician (ART).

   The "One weekend a month, two weeks a year" slogan has lost most of its
   relevance since the Iraq War, when nearly 28% of total US forces in
   Iraq and Afghanistan at the end of 2007 consisted of mobilized
   personnel of the National Guard and other Reserve components.^[35] In
   July 2012, the Army's top general stated his intention to increase the
   annual drill requirement from two weeks per year to up to seven weeks
   per year.^[36]

Agricultural Development Teams[edit]

   Prior to 2008, the functions of Agricultural Development Teams were
   within Provincial Reconstruction Teams of the US Government. Today,
   ADTs consist of people from the Army National Guard and the Air
   National Guard. Today, ADTs bring "an effective platform for enhanced
   dialogue, building confidence, sharing interests, and increasing
   cooperation amongst the disparate peoples and tribes of
   Afghanistan."^[37] These teams are not only affiliated with the
   military, they frequently work across agencies, for example with USAID
   and the Department of State. ADTs provide education and expertise on
   the ground, while also providing security and order that is
   traditionally affiliated with the military. These teams have been
   essential to the counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan as a public
   diplomacy tool to build relations with the local people in the tribes
   and provinces of the country.

   ADTs provide classroom instruction and teachings to Afghans about how
   to improve their farming practices during non-seasonal growing months,
   which allows the farmers to use skills in the winter to prepare for
   farming in the summer and fall. This enhances agricultural production
   and the Afghan economy as a whole. Agricultural education also improves
   lines of communication and builds trust between the people, the US
   government, and the Host Nation.^[38] Additionally, through word of
   mouth in the provinces ideas are spread that inform others about these
   farming techniques, that may not have had direct interaction with the
   ADTs. The National Guard ADTs also introduce their US civilian
   colleagues to the Afghan University personnel, which further
   strengthens relations and trust in the US efforts in Afghanistan.^[39]

   ADTs also enhance public diplomacy in Afghanistan by providing security
   to the local provinces they are working within. This tool has provided
   the teams with the civilian-military partnership that is needed to
   conduct public diplomacy and defeat the insurgents in Afghanistan.
   President Barack Obama said that the US will enhance agricultural
   development instead of big reconstruction projects to build
   Afghanistan's economy, to have an immediate impact on the Afghan
   people. Today, these projects include "basic gardening practices, to
   large watershed and irrigation projects. There are also projects that
   teach bee keeping and livestock production: all of which will have a
   positive impact on unemployment, hunger, and the ability to sustain
   future generations."^[37]

   More and more Afghan tribal leaders have been requesting additional
   ADTs, which illustrates how important the use of public diplomacy has
   been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people. The case
   study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent
   example. This province is one of the most stable and secure provinces
   in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to
   province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the
   UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather
   paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural
   regions in Afghanistan.^[37] ADT should further its progress within the
   provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education, technical support,
   and logistics. In order to defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan public
   diplomacy is an essential force, ADTs allow the US to educate the
   population of Afghanistan with the hopes of strengthening Afghan trust
   in the American mission in Afghanistan.

National Guard vs Reserve[edit]

Combat Arms[edit]

   The Army National Guard consists of 28 fully capable brigade combat
   teams with combat support and combat service support components. The
   Army Reserve is mostly Combat Service Support and Combat Support with
   only one infantry unit (the 100th Infantry Battalion).^[40]

Jurisdiction[edit]

   The senior National Guard Officer in each state is called the Adjutant
   General (or "TAG" for short) and is either appointed or elected in
   accordance with state laws. The National Guard may receive state
   funding, however in most states it is primarily funded through the
   federal government.

   The Army, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, and Air Force Reserve components
   are not under state control and are solely funded by the federal
   government. Unlike the state guard, the Reserve forces are restricted
   from civilian law enforcement operations by posse comitatus.

Relevant laws[edit]

   The United States Congress has enacted various laws which control the
   National Guard
    1. The Militia Act of 1792

                Providing for the authority of the President to call out
                the Militia, and providing federal standards for the
                organization of the Militia.
                For the 111 years that the Militia Act of 1792 remained in
                effect, it defined the position of the militia in relation
                to the federal government. The War of 1812 tested this
                uniquely American defense establishment. To fight the War
                of 1812, the republic formed a small regular military and
                trained it to protect the frontiers and coastlines.
                Although it performed poorly in the offensive against
                Canada, the small force of regulars backed by a well-armed
                militia, accomplished its defensive mission well. Generals
                like Andrew Jackson proved that, just as they had in the
                Revolution, regulars and militia could be effective when
                employed as a team.

    2. The Insurrection Act
    3. The Militia Act of 1862

                Providing for the service of persons of African descent in
                the Militia, and the emancipation of slaves owned by
                Confederates.

    4. Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1385: The Posse Comitatus Act of June
       18, 1878

                Reaction in Congress against the Reconstruction-era
                suspensions of Southern states' rights to organize
                militias led to the passage of the Posse Comitatus Act,
                restricting any person's use of the U.S. Army and, as
                later amended, the U.S. Air Force in domestic law
                enforcement (use of the Navy and Marine Corps, being
                uniformed services within the Department of Defense, is
                similarly restricted by statute).^[41] The U.S. Coast
                Guard, in its peacetime role within the Department of
                Homeland Security, and the National Guard, when not in
                Federal Service, are specifically not limited by this act.

    5. The States revise the military codes – 1881 to 1892
    6. The Militia Act of 1903

                Established the creation of the National Guard of the
                United States as the primary organized reserve force for
                the U.S. armed forces.

    7. National Defense Act of 1916

                This act abandoned the idea of an expandable Regular Army
                and firmly established the traditional concept of the
                citizens' army as the keystone of the United States
                defense forces. It established the concept of merging the
                National Guard, the Army Reserve, and the Regular Army
                into the Army of the United States in time of war. The act
                further expanded the National Guard's role, and guaranteed
                the State militias' status as the Army's primary reserve
                force. The law mandated use of the term "National Guard"
                for that force, and the President was given authority, in
                case of war or national emergency, to mobilize the
                National Guard for the duration of the emergency. The
                number of yearly drills increased from 24 to 48 and annual
                training from five to 15 days. Drill pay was authorized
                for the first time.

    8. The National Defense Act Amendments of 1920

                This act established that the chief of the Militia Bureau
                (later the National Guard Bureau) would be a National
                Guard officer, that National Guard officers would be
                assigned to the general staff and that the divisions, as
                used by the Guard in World War I, would be reorganized.

    9. The National Guard Mobilization Act, 1933

                Made the National Guard a component of the Army.

   10. The National Defense Act of 1947

                Section 207 (f) established the Air National Guard of the
                United States, under the National Guard Bureau.

   11. The Total Force Policy, 1973

                Requires all active and reserve military organizations be
                treated as a single force.

   12. The Montgomery Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act
       for Fiscal Year 1987

                provides that a governor cannot withhold consent with
                regard to active duty outside the United States because of
                any objection to the location, purpose, type, or schedule
                of such duty. This law was challenged and upheld by the
                Supreme Court of the United States in 1990 in Perpich v.
                Department of Defense.^[42])

   13. The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 Pub.L. 109-364

                Federal law was changed in section 1076 so that the
                Governor of a state is no longer the sole commander in
                chief of their state's National Guard during emergencies
                within the state. The President of the United States will
                now be able to take total control of a state's National
                Guard units without the governor's consent.^[43] In a
                letter to Congress, all 50 governors opposed the increase
                in power of the President over the National Guard.^[44]

   14. The National Defense Authorization Act 2008 Pub.L. 110-181

                Repeals provisions in section 1076 in Pub.L. 109-364 but
                still enables the President to call up the National Guard
                of the United States for active federal military service
                during Congressionally sanctioned national emergency or
                war. Places the National Guard Bureau directly under the
                Department of Defense as a joint activity. Promoted the
                Chief of the National Guard Bureau from a three-star to a
                four-star general.

Notable members[edit]

Presidents[edit]

   Militia service was a common trait among presidents of the United
   States. Eighteen of America's 44 presidents have served in colonial or
   state militias and two have served in the National Guard since it was
   established in 1903. Among these, three served in colonial militias
   (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison), 15 served in
   state militias, one in the Army National Guard (Harry S. Truman) and
   one (George W. Bush) served in the Air National Guard.^[45]
