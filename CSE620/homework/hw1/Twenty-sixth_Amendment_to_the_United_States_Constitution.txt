   The Twenty-sixth Amendment (Amendment XXVI) to the United States
   Constitution prohibits the states and the federal government from
   denying the right of US citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to
   vote on account of age. The drive to lower the voting age from 21 to 18
   grew across the country during the 1960s, driven in large part by the
   broader student activism movement protesting the Vietnam War. The
   impetus for drafting an amendment to lower the voting age arose
   following the Supreme Court's decision in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S.
   112 (1970), which held that Congress may set requirements for voting in
   federal elections, but not for state or local elections.

   On March 23, 1971 a proposal to extend the right to vote to citizens
   eighteen years of age and older was adopted by both houses of Congress
   and sent to the states for ratification. The amendment became part of
   the Constitution on July 1, 1971, three months and eight days after the
   amendment was submitted to the states for ratification, making this
   amendment the quickest to be ratified.

Text[edit]

     Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States, who are
     eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or
     abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.

     Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
     by appropriate legislation.^[1]

Background[edit]

   President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his 1954 State of the Union address,
   became the first president to publicly state his support for
   prohibiting age-based denials of suffrage for those 18 and older.^[2]

   On June 22, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an extension of the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all
   federal, state, and local elections.^[3] In his statement on signing
   the extension, Nixon said:

     Despite my misgivings about the constitutionality of this one
     provision, I have signed the bill. I have directed the Attorney
     General to cooperate fully in expediting a swift court test of the
     constitutionality of the 18-year-old provision.^[4]

   Subsequently, Oregon and Texas challenged the law in court.^[5] In
   Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970), the Supreme Court declared
   unconstitutional the parts of the law that required states to register
   18-year-olds for state and local elections.^[6] Justice Hugo Black
   stated:

     I would hold that Congress has exceeded its powers in attempting to
     lower the voting age in state and local elections.^[7]

   By this time, four states had a minimum voting age below 21.^[8]^[9]

   This ruling meant that the law could only apply to federal elections,
   which meant states would have to have separate voting rolls for voters
   between 18 and 20 years old and special ballots for them to vote on
   federal races.^[10]

   During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under
   increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This
   was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who
   were ineligible to vote were conscripted to fight in the war, thus
   lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk
   their lives. "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote," was a common
   slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced
   its roots to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered
   the military draft age to eighteen.

Proposal and ratification[edit]

Adoption by the Congress[edit]

   On March 10, 1971, the Senate voted 94–0 in favor of proposing a
   Constitutional amendment to guarantee that the voting age could not be
   higher than 18.^[11] On March 23, 1971, the House of Representatives
   voted 401–19 in favor of the proposed amendment.^[12]

Ratification by the States[edit]

   Having been passed by the 92nd Congress, the proposed Twenty-sixth
   Amendment was sent to the state legislatures for their consideration.
   Ratification was completed on July 1, 1971, after the amendment had
   been ratified by the following thirty-eight states:^[13]

   Having been ratified by three-fourths of the States (38), the
   Twenty-sixth Amendment became part of the Constitution. On July 5,
   1971, the Administrator of General Services, Robert Kunzig, certiﬁed
   its adoption. President Nixon and Julianne Jones, Joseph W. Loyd, Jr.,
   and Paul S. Larimer of the "Young Americans in Concert" also signed the
   certificate as witnesses. During the signing ceremony, held in the East
   Room of the White House, Nixon talked about his confidence in the youth
   of America.

     As I meet with this group today, I sense that we can have confidence
     that America’s new voters, America’s young generation, will provide
     what America needs as we approach our 200th birthday, not just
     strength and not just wealth but the “Spirit of ‘76’ a spirit of
     moral courage, a spirit of high idealism in which we believe in the
     American dream, but in which we realize that the American dream can
     never be fulfilled until every American has an equal chance to
     fulfill it in his own life.^[14]

   The amendment was subsequently ratified by the following states,
   bringing the total number of ratifying states to forty-three:^[13]

          39. Oklahoma — July 1, 1971
          40. Virginia — July 8, 1971
          41. Wyoming — July 8, 1971
          42. Georgia — October 4, 1971
          43. South Dakota — March 4, 2014^[15]

   No action has been taken on the amendment by the states of Florida,
   Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, or Utah.
