   This is a list of agencies of the United States federal government.

   The executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive
   Office of the President and the United States federal executive
   departments (whose secretaries belong to the Cabinet). Employees of the
   majority of these agencies are considered civil servants.

   The majority of the independent agencies of the United States
   government are also classified as executive agencies (they are
   independent in that they are not subordinated under a Cabinet
   position). There are a small number of independent agencies that are
   not considered part of the executive branch, such as the Library of
   Congress and Congressional Budget Office, which are administered
   directly by Congress and thus are legislative branch agencies. The
   status of these agencies is an open question, however, as Judge Brett
   Kavanaugh noted in a brief concurrence in SoundExchange, Inc. v.
   Librarian of Congress. There is one independent agency in the judicial
   branch.
