History of the Supreme Court of the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The Judiciary Act of 1789 implemented the entire federal judicial
   branch, including the Supreme Court. It was also the first act by
   Congress to be partially invalidated by the Supreme Court.

   The following is a history of the Supreme Court of the United States,
   organized by Chief Justice. The Supreme Court of the United States is
   the only court specifically established by the Constitution of the
   United States, implemented in 1789; under the Judiciary Act of 1789,
   the Court was to be composed of six members—though the number of
   justices has been nine for almost all of its history, this number is
   set by Congress, not the Constitution. The court convened for the first
   time on February 2, 1790.^[1]

   the Court was held in February 1790.

The Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth Courts (1789–1801)[edit]

   Marshall Court

   The Court lacked its own building until 1935; from 1791 to 1801, it met
   in Philadelphia's City Hall.

   The first Chief Justice of the United States was John Jay, and the
   Court's first docketed case was Van Staphorst v. Maryland (1791) and
   its first recorded decision was West v. Barnes (1791).^[2] Perhaps the
   most controversial of the Supreme Court's early decisions was Chisholm
   v. Georgia, in which it held that the federal judiciary could hear
   lawsuits against states. Soon thereafter, responding to the concerns of
   several states, Congress proposed the Eleventh Amendment, which granted
   states immunity from certain types of lawsuits in federal courts. The
   Amendment was ratified in 1795.

   Jay was succeeded as Chief Justice by John Rutledge, and then by Oliver
   Ellsworth. No major cases came before the Supreme Court during this
   time.
   The Supreme Court met in windowless chambers in the Capitol from 1819
   until 1860. The room has been restored and is now known as the Old
   Supreme Court Chamber.

The Marshall Court (1801–1835)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Marshall
   Court
   “ The Constitution . . . is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the
     judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please. ”

   —Thomas Jefferson, about the Marshall Court, ^[3]^[4]

   One of the most significant periods during the history of the Court was
   the tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall (1801 to 1835). In the
   landmark case Marbury v. Madison (1803), Marshall held that the Supreme
   Court could overturn a law passed by Congress if it violated the
   Constitution, legally cementing the power of judicial review. The
   Marshall Court also made several important decisions relating to
   federalism. Marshall took a broad view of the powers of the federal
   government—in particular, the interstate commerce clause and the
   Necessary and Proper Clause. For instance, in McCulloch v. Maryland
   (1819), the Court ruled that the interstate commerce clause and other
   clauses permitted Congress to create a national bank, even though the
   power to create a bank is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.
   Similarly, in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), the Court found that the
   interstate commerce clause permitted Congress to regulate interstate
   navigation.

   The Marshall Court also made several decisions restraining the actions
   of state governments. The notion that the Supreme Court could consider
   appeals from state courts was established in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee
   (1816) and Cohens v. Virginia (1821). In several decisions, the
   Marshall Court confirmed the supremacy of federal laws over state laws.
   For example, in McCulloch, the Court held that a state could not tax an
   agency of the federal government. At the same time, however, the
   Marshall Court held in the landmark case Barron v. Baltimore (1833)
   that the Bill of Rights restricted the federal government alone, and
   did not apply to the states. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court would in
   later years hold that the Fourteenth Amendment had the effect of
   applying most provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states.

   Marshall's forceful personality allowed him to steer his fellow
   Justices; only once did he find himself on the losing side in a
   constitutional case. In that case (Ogden v. Saunders in 1827), Marshall
   set forth his general principles of constitutional interpretation:^[5]
   “ To say that the intention of the instrument must prevail; that this
     intention must be collected from its words; that its words are to be
     understood in that sense in which they are generally used by those for
     whom the instrument was intended; that its provisions are neither to be
     restricted into insignificance, nor extended to objects not
     comprehended in them, nor contemplated by its framers; -- is to repeat
     what has been already said more at large, and is all that can be
     necessary.                                                             ”

   Marshall was in the dissenting minority only eight times throughout his
   tenure at the Court, partly because of his influence over the associate
   justices. As Oliver Wolcott observed when both he and Marshall served
   in the Adams administration, Marshall had the knack of "putting his own
   ideas into the minds of others, unconsciously to them".^[6] However, he
   regularly curbed his own viewpoints, preferring to arrive at decisions
   by consensus.^[7] He adjusted his role to accommodate other members of
   the court as they developed.

   Marshall had charm, humor, a quick intelligence, and the ability to
   bring men together. His sincerity and presence commanded attention. His
   opinions were workmanlike but not especially eloquent or subtle. His
   influence on learned men of the law came from the charismatic force of
   his personality, and his ability to seize upon the key elements of a
   case and make highly persuasive arguments. Together with his vision of
   the future greatness of the nation, these qualities are apparent in his
   historic decisions and gave him the sobriquet, The Great Chief
   Justice.^[8]^[9]^[10]

   Marshall ran a congenial court; there was seldom any bickering. The
   Court met in Washington only two months a year, from the first Monday
   in February through the second or third week in March. Six months of
   the year the justices were doing circuit duty in the various states.
   Marshall was therefore based in Richmond, his hometown, for most of the
   year. When the Court was in session in Washington, the justices boarded
   together in the same rooming house, avoided outside socializing, and
   discussed each case intently among themselves. Decisions were quickly
   made usually in a matter of days. Marshall wrote nearly half the
   decisions during his 33 years in office. Lawyers appearing before the
   court, including the most brilliant in the United States, typically
   gave oral arguments and did not present written briefs. The justices
   did not have clerks, so they listened closely to the oral arguments,
   and decided among themselves what the decision should be. The court
   issued only one decision; the occasional dissenter did not issue a
   separate opinion.^[11]

   While Marshall was very good at listening to the oral briefs, and
   convincing the other justices of his interpretation of the law, he was
   not widely read in the law, and seldom cited precedents. After the
   Court came to a decision, he would usually write it up himself. Often
   he asked Justice Story, a renowned legal scholar, to do the chores of
   locating the precedents, saying, "There, Story; that is the law of this
   case; now go and find the authorities."^[12]

The Taney Court (1836–1864)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Taney Court

   In 1836, Marshall was succeeded as Chief Justice by Roger B. Taney, who
   had a somewhat more limited view of the powers of the federal
   government. At a time when sectional tensions between the North and
   South were high, many of the Supreme Court's decisions—particularly
   those relating to slavery—met with controversy and contention. Most
   controversial was the Taney Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford
   (1857). Dred Scott, a slave from Missouri, sued for his freedom on the
   grounds that his master had taken him into Illinois and the territory
   of Wisconsin, both of which prohibited slavery, for extended periods of
   time. Taney, however, ruled that members of the African race, "beings
   of an inferior order," were not and could never become citizens of the
   United States. Consequently, he ruled that Scott therefore had no
   standing to file the lawsuit. Moreover, he held that the Missouri
   Compromise, under which Congress prohibited slavery in certain
   territories that formed part of the Louisiana Purchase, was
   unconstitutional. The controversial decision met with vigorous
   opposition from abolitionists, and contributed to the tensions that led
   to the Civil War during the next decade. The Civil War culminated in a
   victory for the Union and in the abolition of slavery (see the
   Thirteenth Amendment).

The Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910)[edit]

   In the midst of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln appointed Salmon P.
   Chase to be Chief Justice. Chase had strong anti-slavery credentials
   and had previously served Lincoln as Secretary of the Treasury. His
   post-Civil War tenure featured several key decisions affirming the
   indestructibility of the Union. Chase was considered highly ambitious,
   even for a politician. In 1872, Chase, while serving on the Supreme
   Court, ran for the Presidency, but his efforts were ultimately
   unsuccessful. Chase continued to serve as Chief Justice until his death
   in 1873.

   In the aftermath of the Civil War Congress passed and the states
   ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which, among other things, prevented
   states from abridging the "privileges and immunities of citizens," from
   denying due process of law, and from denying equal protection of the
   laws to any person. Many cases that came before the Court in the
   post–Civil War era involved interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
   In the Civil Rights Cases (1883), the Court under Chief Justice
   Morrison Waite held that Congress could not prohibit racial
   discrimination by private individuals (as opposed to governments) on
   the grounds of the Fourteenth Amendment. Later, in Plessy v. Ferguson
   (1896), the Court under Chief Justice Melville Fuller determined that
   the equal protection clause did not prohibit racial segregation in
   public facilities, as long as the facilities were equal (giving rise to
   the infamous term "separate but equal"). The sole dissenter in that
   case was John Marshall Harlan.^[13]

The White and Taft courts (1910–1930)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the White Court,
   List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Taft Court and Lochner
   era

   In the early twentieth century, the Supreme Court established that the
   Fourteenth Amendment protected the "liberty of contract." On the
   grounds of the Fourteenth Amendment and other provisions of the
   Constitution, it controversially overturned many state and federal laws
   designed to protect employees. The first important decision of the era
   was Lochner v. New York (1905), in which the Court overturned a New
   York law limiting the number of hours bakers could work each week. In
   Adair v. United States (1908), the Court overruled a federal law which
   forbade "yellow dog contracts" (contracts that prohibited workers from
   joining unions). Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923) involved a
   decision that a District of Columbia minimum wage law was
   unconstitutional.

   In 1925, the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling in Gitlow v. New
   York, establishing the doctrine of incorporation, under which
   provisions of the Bill of Rights were deemed to restrict the states.
   Originally, as Chief Justice John Marshall ruled in Barron v. Baltimore
   (1833), the Bill of Rights restricted only the federal government;
   however, during the twentieth century, the Supreme Court held in a
   series of decisions the Fourteenth Amendment had the effect of applying
   some (but not all) provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states. The
   first such decision was Gitlow, in which the Supreme Court incorporated
   the protection of freedom of speech afforded by the First Amendment.
   Important decisions relating to incorporations were made during later
   decades, especially the 1960s.

The Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930—1953)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Hughes
   Court, List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Stone Court and
   List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Vinson Court
   U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.

   During the 1930s, the Supreme Court contained both a solid liberal bloc
   and a conservative bloc of Justices. The four conservative Justices,
   known as "The Four Horsemen," were James McReynolds, George Sutherland,
   Willis Van Devanter and Pierce Butler. Their liberal opponents on the
   bench—Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo and Harlan Stone—were conversely
   known "The Three Musketeers", while Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes
   and Justice Owen Roberts controlled the balance by serving as the swing
   votes. Hughes, as a progressive Republican, tended to side with the
   Four Horsemen, as he did in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United
   States, whilst Roberts was also swayed to the side of the
   conservatives.

   As a result, The Court continued to enforce a Federal laissez-faire
   approach, overturning many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New
   Deal programs, which were designed to combat the Great Depression, by
   5–4 margins. Most notably, the National Industrial Recovery Act was
   overturned in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), and the
   Agricultural Adjustment Act was struck down in United States v. Butler
   (1936). In response, President Roosevelt proposed the Judiciary
   Reorganization Bill (called the "court-packing bill" by its opponents),
   which would have increased the size of the Supreme Court and permitted
   the appointment of additional (presumably pro-New Deal) Justices. The
   bill, however, had many opponents, including Roosevelt's own Vice
   President John Nance Garner, and was defeated in Congress.

   Soon after the proposal of the court-packing plan, however, the Supreme
   Court ended the trend that had prevailed since Lochner. Justice
   Roberts, who had previously voted with the conservative bloc in
   invalidating New Deal legislation, began to vote on the opposite side.
   Roberts' decision spelled the end of the Lochner era and has been
   dubbed the "switch in time that saved nine." As the Horsemen retired,
   Roosevelt, the longest-serving President in history, availed repeatedly
   of opportunity to replace them with more liberal Justices. After Hughes
   retired, Stone—The last remaining "Musketeer"—was appointed by
   Roosevelt to be elevated to the position of Chief Justice. In 1945,
   eight of the nine sitting Justices had been appointed by President
   Roosevelt, the sole exception being Owen Roberts.

The Warren Court (1953–1969)[edit]

   Main article: Warren Court
   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Warren Court

   In 1953, President Dwight David Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren, who
   was then governor of California, to the position of Chief Justice.
   Warren's term, which lasted until 1969, was arguably one of the most
   significant in the history of the Court. Under him, the Court made a
   long series of landmark decisions. Notable members of the liberal wing
   of the Court aside from Warren included Hugo Black, William O. Douglas
   (the longest-serving Justice in the Court's history) and William J.
   Brennan. The foremost conservative members of the Court were Felix
   Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II (grandson of the first Justice
   Harlan). The first important case of Warren's tenure was Brown v. Board
   of Education (1954), in which the Court unanimously declared
   segregation in public schools unconstitutional, effectively reversing
   the precedent set earlier in Plessy v. Ferguson and other cases.

   The Warren Court also made several controversial decisions relating to
   the Bill of Rights. The doctrine of incorporation, which had first
   taken root in Gitlow v. New York, was applied fully to most provisions
   of the Bill of Rights. In Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Court declared
   that officially sanctioned prayer in public schools was
   unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Similarly, in Abington
   School District v. Schempp (1963), it struck down mandatory Bible
   readings in public schools. The Court also expanded and incorporated
   the rights of criminal defendants, on the basis of the Fourth, Fifth,
   and Sixth Amendments. In Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the Court incorporated
   the Fourth Amendment and ruled that illegally seized evidence could not
   be used in a trial. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) established that states
   were required to provide attorneys to indigent defendants. Miranda v.
   Arizona (1966) held that the police must inform suspects of their
   rights (including the right to remain silent and the right to an
   attorney) before being interrogated. (The decision is the source of the
   famous Miranda warning.) Another significant and controversial decision
   made by the Warren Court was Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which
   established that the Constitution protected the right to privacy.

The Burger Court (1969–1986)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Burger Court

   Chief Justice Earl Warren was succeeded by Warren E. Burger, who served
   from 1969 to 1986. The Burger Court is best remembered for its ruling
   in Roe v. Wade (1973), which held that there is a constitutionally
   protected right to have an abortion in some circumstances. The Court
   also made important decisions relating to the First Amendment. In Lemon
   v. Kurtzman (1971), it established the "Lemon test" for determining if
   legislation violates the establishment clause. Similarly, it
   established the "Miller test" for laws banning obscenity in Miller v.
   California (1973).

   Other rulings include Landmark Communications v. Virginia in which the
   court ruled for fining a newspaper for revealing the identity of a
   judge under investigation by state commissioner H. Warrington Sharp.
   The Burger Court also established a moratorium on capital punishment in
   Furman v. Georgia (1972), holding that states generally awarded death
   sentences arbitrarily and inconsistently. The moratorium, however, was
   lifted four years later in Gregg v. Georgia (1976). Also in United
   States v. Nixon (1974), the court ruled that the courts have the final
   voice in determining constitutional questions and that no person, not
   even the President of the United States, is completely above law.

The Rehnquist Court (1986–2005)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist
   Court
   U.S. Supreme Court, 1998.

   Chief Justice William Rehnquist served from Burger's retirement in 1986
   until his own death on September 3, 2005. The Rehnquist Court generally
   took a limited view of Congress's powers under the commerce clause, as
   exemplified by United States v. Lopez (1995). The Court made numerous
   controversial decisions, including Texas v. Johnson (1989), which
   declared that flag burning was a form of speech protected by the First
   Amendment; Lee v. Weisman (1992), which declared officially-sanctioned,
   student-led school prayers unconstitutional; Stenberg v. Carhart
   (2000), which voided laws prohibiting late-term abortions; and Lawrence
   v. Texas (2003), which struck down laws prohibiting sodomy. (Some
   commentators see these decisions as part of the "culture wars.")
   Another controversial decision of the Rehnquist court in 2003 was
   Grutter v. Bollinger which upheld affirmative action. Perhaps the most
   controversial decision made by the Court came in Bush v. Gore (2000),
   which ended election recounts in Florida following the presidential
   election of 2000, allowing George W. Bush to become the forty-third
   U.S. President.

   Rehnquist led a remarkably stable Court - for the eleven years
   preceding Rehnquist's death, the composition of the Court remained
   unchanged - the longest such stretch in over 180 years.^[14]

The Roberts Court (2005–)[edit]

   See also: List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Roberts
   Court

   Chief Justice John G. Roberts was confirmed by the United States Senate
   on September 29, 2005, and presided over the Court for the first time
   on October 3, 2005, the day the 2005–2006 session opened. On October
   31, 2005, President George W. Bush announced that he was nominating
   Samuel Alito to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and Bush
   submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10, 2005. Under
   Roberts the Court has drifted primarily to the right in areas like the
   death penalty (Kansas v. Marsh), abortion (Gonzales v. Carhart), the
   exclusionary rule for Fourth Amendment violations (Hudson v. Michigan),
   and campaign-finance regulation (Citizens United v. Federal Election
   Commission). On November 20, 2007, the Court agreed to hear a case,
   District of Columbia v. Heller, that was regarded as the first
   important and historically significant decision on the Second Amendment
   to the Constitution since 1875. On March 18, 2008, the Supreme Court
   heard arguments concerning the constitutionality of a District of
   Columbia ban on handguns.^[15] On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court
   ruled that "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to
   possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use
   that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within
   the home."^[16]

   On August 8, 2009, Sonia Sotomayor became the first Hispanic-American
   to serve on the Supreme Court after being nominated by Barack Obama and
   confirmed by the Senate to replace the retiring Justice David Souter.
   On May 10, 2010, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to replace
   retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 7,
   2010. This marks the first time in the history of the Court that three
   women are serving as Justices and that no Protestants are serving
   (instead, there are six Roman Catholics and three Jews).
