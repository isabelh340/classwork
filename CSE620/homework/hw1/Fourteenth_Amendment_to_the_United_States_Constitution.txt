   The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States
   Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the Reconstruction
   Amendments. The amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal
   protection of the laws, and was proposed in response to issues related
   to former slaves following the American Civil War. The amendment was
   bitterly contested, particularly by Southern states, which were forced
   to ratify it in order for them to regain representation in Congress.
   The Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the
   most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for
   landmark decisions such as Roe v. Wade (1973), regarding abortion, and
   Bush v. Gore (2000), regarding the 2000 presidential election. The
   amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials,
   including those acting on behalf of such an official.

   The second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom
   litigated. However, Section 2's reference to "rebellion and other
   crimes" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for felony
   disenfranchisement. The fifth section gives Congress enforcement power.
   The amendment's first section includes several clauses: the Citizenship
   Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal
   Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition
   of citizenship, overruling the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott
   v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from
   African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. The
   Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted in such a way that
   it does very little.

   The Due Process Clause prohibits state and local government officials
   from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without
   legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the
   federal judiciary to make most of the Bill of Rights applicable to the
   states, as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements
   that state laws must satisfy.

   The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal
   protection under the law to all people within its jurisdiction. This
   clause was the basis for Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the
   Supreme Court decision that precipitated the dismantling of racial
   segregation, and for many other decisions rejecting irrational or
   unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.

     Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and
     subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United
     States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or
     enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
     citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any
     person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
     nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
     of the laws.

     Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several
     States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole
     number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But
     when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors
     for President and Vice President of the United States,
     Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of
     a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any
     of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of
     age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged,
     except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of
     representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the
     number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male
     citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

     Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in
     Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any
     office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any
     State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of
     Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of
     any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any
     State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have
     engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid
     or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of
     two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

     Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States,
     authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions
     and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion,
     shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State
     shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of
     insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim
     for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts,
     obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.

     Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate
     legislation, the provisions of this article.^[1]

Adoption

Proposal by Congress

   In the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era
   that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former
   slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865
   Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished
   slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress,
   however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create
   in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated
   Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would now
   be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than
   the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise,
   the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the
   population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the
   former slaves were allowed to vote.^[2]^[3] Republicans began looking
   for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting
   votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their
   disenfranchisement.^[2]^[4]^[5]

   In 1865, Congress passed what would become the Civil Rights Act of
   1866, guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or
   previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also
   guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on
   the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes
   attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition
   by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to
   enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning
   firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court.^[6]

   Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill,
   President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he
   objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the
   freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the
   Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and
   against whites.^[7]^[8] Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was
   overridden and the measure became law. This was the first time in
   American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary
   to override a presidential veto.^[9] Despite this victory, even some
   Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began
   to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn
   those goals into laws.^[10]^[11] The experience also encouraged both
   radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for
   black rights, rather than relying on temporary political
   majorities.^[12]

   Over 70 proposals for an amendment were drafted.^[13] In late 1865, the
   Joint Committee on Reconstruction proposed an amendment stating that
   any citizens barred from voting on the basis of race by a state would
   not be counted for purposes of representation of that state.^[14] This
   amendment passed the House, but was blocked in the Senate by a
   coalition of Radical Republicans led by Charles Sumner, who believed
   the proposal a "compromise with wrong", and Democrats opposed to black
   rights.^[15] Consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by
   Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio, which would enable Congress to
   safeguard "equal protection of life, liberty, and property" of all
   citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.^[15] In April 1866,
   the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully
   negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second
   proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and
   voting by ex-Confederates.^[15] The House of Representatives passed
   House Resolution 127, 39th Congress several weeks later and sent to the
   Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to
   it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3 and 4 were adopted on
   June 8, 1866 and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote. The
   House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138-36 vote. A
   concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal
   to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of
   Congress on June 18.^[16]

   The Radical Republicans were satisfied that they had secured civil
   rights for blacks, but were disappointed that the amendment would not
   also secure political rights for blacks, in particular the right to
   vote.^[17] For example, Thaddeus Stevens, a leader of the disappointed
   Radical Republicans, said: "I find that we shall be obliged to be
   content with patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice, and
   leaving it, in many of its parts, to be swept through by the tempests,
   the frosts, and the storms of despotism."^[17]^[18] Abolitionist
   Wendell Phillips called it a "fatal and total surrender".^[18] This
   point would later be addressed by the Fifteenth Amendment.

   Ratification of the amendment was bitterly contested. State
   legislatures in every formerly Confederate state, with the exception of
   Tennessee, refused to ratify it. This refusal led to the passage of the
   Reconstruction Acts. Ignoring the existing state governments, military
   government was imposed until new civil governments were established and
   the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.^[19] It also prompted Congress
   to pass a law on March 2, 1867, requiring that a former Confederate
   state must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before "said State shall be
   declared entitled to representation in Congress".^[20]

   The first twenty-eight states to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment
   were:^[21]
     * Connecticut – June 30, 1866
     * New Hampshire – July 6, 1866
     * Tennessee – July 18, 1866
     * New Jersey – September 11, 1866 (Rescinded ratification – February
       20, 1868/March 24, 1868; re-ratified – April 23, 2003)
     * Oregon – September 19, 1866 (Rescinded ratification – October 16,
       1868; re-ratified – April 25, 1973)
     * Vermont – October 30, 1866
     * New York – January 10, 1867
     * Ohio – January 11, 1867 (Rescinded ratification – January 13, 1868;
       re-ratified – March 12, 2003)
     * Illinois – January 15, 1867
     * West Virginia – January 16, 1867
     * Michigan – January 16, 1867
     * Minnesota – January 16, 1867
     * Kansas – January 17, 1867
     * Maine – January 19, 1867
     * Nevada – January 22, 1867
     * Indiana – January 23, 1867
     * Missouri – January 25, 1867
     * Pennsylvania – February 6, 1867
     * Rhode Island – February 7, 1867
     * Wisconsin – February 13, 1867
     * Massachusetts – March 20, 1867
     * Nebraska – June 15, 1867
     * Iowa – March 16, 1868
     * Arkansas – April 6, 1868
     * Florida – June 9, 1868
     * North Carolina – July 4, 1868 (After rejection – December 14, 1866)
     * Louisiana – July 9, 1868 (After rejection – February 6, 1867)
     * South Carolina – July 9, 1868 (After rejection – December 20, 1866)

   On July 20, 1868, Secretary of State William H. Seward certified that
   the amendment had become part of the Constitution on July 9, 1868, if
   withdrawals of ratification by New Jersey and Ohio were
   ineffective.^[22] The following day, Congress adopted and transmitted
   to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the
   Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution and directing the
   Secretary of State to promulgate it as such.^[23] Both New Jersey and
   Ohio were named in the congressional resolution as having ratified the
   amendment. Their inclusion as ratifying states by Congress goes to the
   merits of rescinding a ratification after it's been affirmed, and of
   approving a ratification after it's been rejected. It would appear that
   Congress has determined both have no impact on the ratification process
   – see Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939).^[23] Accordingly, Seward
   issued an unconditional certificate of ratification, dated July 28,
   1868, declaring that the Fourteenth Amendment had been duly ratified by
   the requisite three-fourths of the states. During the preceding week,
   two additional states had ratified the amendment, which left no doubt
   that the amendment had indeed become operational.^[24]

   The Fourteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified:^[21]
     * Alabama – July 13, 1868
     * Georgia – July 21, 1868 (After rejection – November 9, 1866)
     * Virginia – October 8, 1869 (after rejection – January 9, 1867)
     * Mississippi – January 17, 1870
     * Texas – February 18, 1870 (after rejection – October 27, 1866)
     * Delaware – February 12, 1901 (after rejection – February 8, 1867)
     * Maryland – April 4, 1959^[25] (after rejection – March 23, 1867)
     * California – May 6, 1959
     * Kentucky – March 30, 1976 (after rejection – January 8, 1867)

Citizenship and civil rights

   The two pages of the Fourteenth Amendment in the National Archives

Background

   Section 1 of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship
   and also protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by
   any state or state actor. Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by
   private persons is not addressed by this amendment; the Supreme Court
   held in the Civil Rights Cases (1883)^[26] that the amendment was
   limited to "state action" and, therefore, did not authorize the
   Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or
   organizations (though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination
   via other parts of the Constitution). U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph
   P. Bradley commented in the Civil Rights Cases that “individual
   invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [14th]
   Amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes
   void all state legislation, and state action of every kind, which
   impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States,
   or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process
   of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the
   laws.”^[27]

   The Radical Republicans who advanced the Thirteenth Amendment hoped to
   ensure broad civil and human rights for the newly freed people—but its
   scope was disputed before it even went into effect.^[28] The framers of
   the Fourteenth Amendment wanted these principles enshrined in the
   Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared
   unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and also to prevent a future
   Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote.^[29]^[30] This
   section was also in response to violence against black people within
   the Southern states. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction found that
   only a Constitutional amendment could protect black people's rights and
   welfare within those states.^[31]

   This first section of the amendment has been the most frequently
   litigated part of the amendment,^[32] and this amendment in turn has
   been the most frequently litigated part of the Constitution.^[33]

Citizenship Clause

   Main article: Citizenship Clause
   Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan, author of the Citizenship Clause

   The Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's Dred Scott
   decision that black people were not citizens and could not become
   citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship.^[34]^[35] Some members
   of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate
   doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of
   1866,^[36] or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal
   or alter the main provisions of that Act.^[37] The Civil Rights Act of
   1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States
   if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the
   Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.

   There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress
   and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the
   congressional debate over the amendment, as well as the customs and
   understandings prevalent at that time.^[38]^[39] Some of the major
   issues that have arisen about this clause are the extent to which it
   included Native Americans, its coverage of non-citizens legally present
   in the United States when they have a child, whether the clause allows
   revocation of citizenship, and whether the clause applies to illegal
   immigrants.

Native Americans

   During the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator
   Jacob M. Howard of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship
   Clause^[40]—described the clause as having the same content, despite
   different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely,
   that it excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and
   "persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
   belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers."^[41]
   According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of Western Kentucky
   University, "A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of
   the citizenship clause."^[40] Others also agreed that the children of
   ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.^[42]^[43]

   Senator James Rood Doolittle of Wisconsin asserted that all Native
   Americans were subject to United States jurisdiction, so that the
   phrase "Indians not taxed" would be preferable,^[44] but Senate
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull and Howard disputed this,
   arguing that the federal government did not have full jurisdiction over
   Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with
   the United States.^[45]^[46] In Elk v. Wilkins (1884),^[47] the
   clause's meaning was tested regarding whether birth in the United
   States automatically extended national citizenship. The Supreme Court
   held that Native Americans who voluntarily quit their tribes did not
   automatically gain national citizenship.^[48] The issue was resolved
   with the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted
   full U.S. citizenship to indigenous peoples.^[49]

Children born to citizens of other countries

   The Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United
   States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their
   parents.^[50] At the time of the amendment's passage, three Senators,
   including Trumbull,^[51] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as
   President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and
   the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at
   birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively
   contrary opinion.^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55] These congressional remarks
   applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the
   problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some
   scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized
   immigrants, although the law of the land continues to be based on the
   standard interpretation.^[50] Congress during the 21st century has
   occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of
   "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in
   the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.^[56]

   The clause's meaning with regard to a child of legal immigrants was
   tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898).^[57] The Supreme Court
   held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United
   States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence
   in the United States and are carrying on business in the United
   States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other
   official capacity by a foreign power—was a citizen of the United
   States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children
   of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.^[58]

Loss of citizenship

   Loss of national citizenship is possible only under the following
   circumstances:
     * Fraud in the naturalization process. Technically, this is not loss
       of citizenship but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization
       and a declaration that the immigrant never was a citizen of the
       United States.
     * Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship. This may be accomplished
       either through renunciation procedures specially established by the
       State Department or through other actions that demonstrate desire
       to give up national citizenship.^[59]

   For much of the country's history, voluntary acquisition or exercise of
   a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of
   national citizenship.^[60] This concept was enshrined in a series of
   treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft
   Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in
   Afroyim v. Rusk (1967),^[61] as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980),^[62]
   holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred
   the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke
   citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the
   United States.^[63]

Privileges or Immunities Clause

   Main article: Privileges or Immunities Clause

   The Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and
   immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was
   patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article
   IV,^[64] which protects the privileges and immunities of state
   citizenship from interference by other states.^[65] In the
   Slaughter-House Cases (1873),^[65] the Supreme Court concluded that the
   Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—"national
   citizenship" and "state citizenship"—and the Court held that the
   Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only
   with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national
   citizenship.^[65]^[66] The Court concluded that the privileges and
   immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that "owe
   their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its
   Constitution, or its laws."^[65] The Court recognized few such rights,
   including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run
   for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on
   the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to
   travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and
   petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,
   and the right to participate in the government's
   administration.^[65]^[66] This decision has not been overruled and has
   been specifically reaffirmed several times.^[67] Largely as a result of
   the narrowness of the Slaughter-House opinion, this clause subsequently
   lay dormant for well over a century.^[68]

   In Saenz v. Roe (1999),^[69] the Court ruled that a component of the
   "right to travel" is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause:

     Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the
     Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most
     notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the
     Slaughter-House Cases (1873), it has always been common ground that
     this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel.
     Writing for the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice
     Miller explained that one of the privileges conferred by this Clause
     "is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition,
     become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence
     therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State."
     (emphasis added)

   Justice Miller actually wrote in the Slaughter-House Cases that the
   right to become a citizen of a state (by residing in that state) "is
   conferred by the very article under consideration" (emphasis added),
   rather than by the "clause" under consideration.^[65]^[70]

   In McDonald v. Chicago (2010), Justice Clarence Thomas, while
   concurring with the majority in incorporating the Second Amendment
   against the states, declared that he reached this conclusion through
   the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause.
   Randy Barnett has referred to Justice Thomas's concurring opinion as a
   "complete restoration" of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.^[71]

Due Process Clause

   Main article: Due Process Clause

   The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies against only
   the states, but it is otherwise textually identical to the Due Process
   Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal
   government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical
   doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process.^[72]
   Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when
   the government seeks to burden^[jargon] a person's protected interests
   in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the
   guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be
   encroached on by government.^[73] The Due Process Clause of the
   Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the
   Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal
   government, and applies them against the states.^[74]

Substantive due process

   Main article: Substantive due process

   Beginning with Allgeyer v. Louisiana (1897),^[75] the Court interpreted
   the Due Process Clause as providing substantive protection to private
   contracts, thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic
   regulation; this principle was referred to as "freedom of
   contract".^[76] Thus, the Court struck down a law decreeing maximum
   hours for workers in a bakery in Lochner v. New York (1905)^[77] and
   struck down a minimum wage law in Adkins v. Children's Hospital
   (1923).^[78] In Meyer v. Nebraska (1923),^[79] the Court stated that
   the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause

     "[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint
     but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any
     of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to
     marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God
     according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to
     enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to
     the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men."^[80]

   However, the Court did uphold some economic regulation, such as state
   Prohibition laws (Mugler v. Kansas, 1887),^[81] laws declaring maximum
   hours for mine workers (Holden v. Hardy, 1898),^[82] laws declaring
   maximum hours for female workers (Muller v. Oregon, 1908),^[83] and
   President Woodrow Wilson's intervention in a railroad strike (Wilson v.
   New, 1917),^[84] as well as federal laws regulating narcotics (United
   States v. Doremus, 1919).^[85] The Court repudiated, but did not
   explicitly overrule, the "freedom of contract" line of cases in West
   Coast Hotel v. Parrish (1937).^[86]

   Although the "freedom of contract" has fallen into disfavor, by the
   1960s, the Court had extended its interpretation of substantive due
   process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in
   the Constitution but that, according to the Court, extend or derive
   from existing rights.^[76] For example, the Due Process Clause is also
   the foundation of a constitutional right to privacy. The Court first
   ruled that privacy was protected by the Constitution in Griswold v.
   Connecticut (1965), which overturned a Connecticut law criminalizing
   birth control.^[87] While Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the
   majority that the right to privacy was found in the "penumbras" of
   various provisions in the Bill of Rights, Justices Arthur Goldberg and
   John Marshall Harlan II wrote in concurring opinions that the "liberty"
   protected by the Due Process Clause included individual privacy.^[88]

   The right to privacy was the basis for Roe v. Wade (1973),^[89] in
   which the Court invalidated a Texas law forbidding abortion except to
   save the mother's life. Like Goldberg's and Harlan's concurring
   opinions in Griswold, the majority opinion authored by Justice Harry A.
   Blackmun located the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause's
   protection of liberty. The decision disallowed many state and federal
   abortion restrictions, and it became one of the most controversial in
   the Court's history.^[90] In Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992),^[91]
   the Court decided that "the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be
   retained and once again reaffirmed."^[92] In Lawrence v. Texas
   (2003),^[93] the Court found that a Texas law against same-sex sexual
   intercourse violated the right to privacy.^[94]

Procedural due process

   When the government seeks to burden a person's protected liberty
   interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that
   procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government
   provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral
   hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such
   process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil
   service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a
   welfare recipient's benefits.^[95]^[96]

   The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to
   recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest.
   For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009),^[97] the Court
   ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia
   had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his
   campaign for election to that court.^[98]

Incorporation

   Main article: Incorporation of the Bill of Rights

   While many state constitutions are modeled after the United States
   Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not
   necessarily include provisions comparable to the Bill of Rights. In
   Barron v. Baltimore (1833),^[99] the Supreme Court unanimously ruled
   that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the
   states.^[100] However, the Supreme Court has subsequently held that
   most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the
   Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called
   "incorporation."^[74]

   Whether incorporation was intended by the amendment's framers, such as
   John Bingham, has been debated by legal historians.^[101] According to
   legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar, the framers and early supporters of the
   Fourteenth Amendment believed that it would ensure that the states
   would be required to recognize the same individual rights as the
   federal government; all of these rights were likely understood as
   falling within the "privileges or immunities" safeguarded by the
   amendment.^[102]

   By the latter half of the 20th century, nearly all of the rights in the
   Bill of Rights had been applied to the states.^[103] The Supreme Court
   has held that the amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates all of
   the substantive protections of the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth (except
   for its Grand Jury Clause) and Sixth Amendments and the Cruel and
   Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment.^[104] While the
   Third Amendment has not been applied to the states by the Supreme
   Court, the Second Circuit ruled that it did apply to the states within
   that circuit's jurisdiction in Engblom v. Carey.^[105] The Seventh
   Amendment right to jury trial in civil cases has been held not to be
   applicable to the states,^[104]^[106] but the amendment's
   Re-Examination Clause applies not only to federal courts, but also to
   "a case tried before a jury in a state court and brought to the Supreme
   Court on appeal."^[107]

Equal Protection Clause

   Main article: Equal Protection Clause
   Representative John Bingham of Ohio, principal author of the Equal
   Protection Clause

   The Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack
   of equal protection provided by law in states with Black Codes. Under
   Black Codes, blacks could not sue, give evidence, or be witnesses. They
   also were punished more harshly than whites.^[108] The Supreme Court in
   Strauder v. West Virginia stated that the Equal Protection Clause was

     designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the
     civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to
     give to that race the protection of the general government, in that
     enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States.

   The Clause mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated
   equally by the law.^[109] Although the text of the Fourteenth Amendment
   applies the Equal Protection Clause only against the states, the
   Supreme Court, since Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), has applied the Clause
   against the federal government through the Due Process Clause of the
   Fifth Amendment under a doctrine called "reverse
   incorporation."^[110]^[111]

   In Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886), the Supreme Court has clarified that the
   meaning of "person" and "within its jurisdiction" in the Equal
   Protection Clause would not be limited to discrimination against
   African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and
   nationalities such as (in this case) legal aliens in the United States
   who are Chinese citizens:^[112]^[113] "These provisions are universal
   in their application to all persons within the territorial
   jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or
   of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the
   protection of equal laws."

   Persons "within its jurisdiction" are entitled to equal protection from
   a state. Largely because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of
   Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and
   immunities of citizens in the several states, the Supreme Court has
   rarely construed the phrase "within its jurisdiction" in relation to
   natural persons.^[113] In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210–16 (1982)
   where the Court hold that aliens illegally present in a state are
   within its jurisdiction and may thus raise equal protection
   claims^[113] the Court explicated the meaning of the phrase "within its
   jurisdiction" as follows: "[U]se of the phrase "within its
   jurisdiction" confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth
   Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is
   subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a
   State's territory."^[114] The Court reached this understanding among
   other things from Senator Howard, a member of the Joint Committee of
   Fifteen, and the floor manager of the amendment in the Senate. Senator
   Howard was explicit about the broad objectives of the Fourteenth
   Amendment and the intention to make its provisions applicable to all
   who "may happen to be" within the jurisdiction of a state:^[114]

     The last two clauses of the first section of the amendment disable a
     State from depriving not merely a citizen of the United States, but
     any person, whoever he may be, of life, liberty, or property without
     due process of law, or from denying to him the equal protection of
     the laws of the State. This abolishes all class legislation in the
     States and does away with the injustice of subjecting one caste of
     persons to a code not applicable to another. ... It will, if adopted
     by the States, forever disable every one of them from passing laws
     trenching upon those fundamental rights and privileges which pertain
     to citizens of the United States, and to all person who may happen
     to be within their jurisdiction. [emphasis added by the U.S. Supreme
     Court]^[115]

   The relationship between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was
   addressed by Justice Field in Wong Wing v. United States. He observed
   with respect to the phrase "within its jurisdiction": "The term
   'person,' used in the Fifth Amendment, is broad enough to include any
   and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic. A
   resident, alien born, is entitled to the same protection under the laws
   that a citizen is entitled to. He owes obedience to the laws of the
   country in which he is domiciled, and, as a consequence, he is entitled
   to the equal protection of those laws. ... The contention that persons
   within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond
   the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the
   bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that
   no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
   protection of the laws."^[116]

   Whether foreign corporations are also within the jurisdiction of a
   state was also decided by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held
   that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court in which it was
   not licensed to do business to recover possession of property
   wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction
   and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the
   suit.^[113] When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do
   business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal
   protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with
   domestic corporations.^[113]

   In Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad (1886), the court
   reporter included a statement by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in the
   decision's headnote:

     The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the
     provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which
     forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
     equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are
     all of the opinion that it does.^[117]

   This dictum, which established that corporations enjoyed personhood
   under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later
   courts.^[117] It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth
   century, though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo
   Black and William O. Douglas.^[118]

   In the decades following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the
   Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from juries (Strauder v.
   West Virginia, 1880)^[119] or discriminating against Chinese Americans
   in the regulation of laundry businesses (Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
   1886),^[120] as violations of the Equal Protection Clause. However, in
   Plessy v. Ferguson (1896),^[121] the Supreme Court held that the states
   could impose segregation so long as they provided similar
   facilities—the formation of the "separate but equal" doctrine.^[122]

   The Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause
   in Berea College v. Kentucky (1908),^[123] holding that the states
   could force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from
   having both black and white students. By the early 20th century, the
   Equal Protection Clause had been eclipsed to the point that Justice
   Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. dismissed it as "the usual last resort of
   constitutional arguments."^[124]
   Thurgood Marshall served as chief counsel in the landmark Fourteenth
   Amendment decision Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

   The Court held to the "separate but equal" doctrine for more than fifty
   years, despite numerous cases in which the Court itself had found that
   the segregated facilities provided by the states were almost never
   equal, until Brown v. Board of Education (1954) reached the
   Court.^[125] In Brown the Court ruled that even if segregated black and
   white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers,
   segregation by itself was harmful to black students and so was
   unconstitutional. Brown met with a campaign of resistance from white
   Southerners, and for decades the federal courts attempted to enforce
   Brown's mandate against repeated attempts at circumvention.^[126] This
   resulted in the controversial desegregation busing decrees handed down
   by federal courts in various parts of the nation.^[127] In Parents
   Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007),
   the Court ruled that race could not be the determinative factor in
   determining to which public schools parents may transfer their
   children.^[128]

   In Plyler v. Doe (1982) the Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute
   denying free public education to illegal immigrants as a violation of
   the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because
   discrimination on the basis of illegal immigration status did not
   further a substantial state interest. The Court reasoned that illegal
   aliens and their children, though not citizens of the United States or
   Texas, are people "in any ordinary sense of the term" and, therefore,
   are afforded Fourteenth Amendment protections.^[129]

   In Hernandez v. Texas (1954), the Court held that the Fourteenth
   Amendment protects those beyond the racial classes of white or "Negro"
   and extends to other racial and ethnic groups, such as Mexican
   Americans in this case.^[130] In the half-century following Brown, the
   Court extended the reach of the Equal Protection Clause to other
   historically disadvantaged groups, such as women and illegitimate
   children, although it has applied a somewhat less stringent standard
   than it has applied to governmental discrimination on the basis of race
   (United States v. Virginia, 1996;^[131] Levy v. Louisiana,
   1968^[132]).^[133]

   The Supreme Court ruled in Regents of the University of California v.
   Bakke (1978)^[134] that affirmative action in the form of racial quotas
   in public university admissions was a violation of Title VI of the
   Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several
   factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title
   VI.^[135] In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003)^[136] and Grutter v. Bollinger
   (2003),^[137] the Court considered two race-conscious admissions
   systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its
   goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity.^[138]
   In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions
   system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity
   violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a
   race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that
   used race as one of many factors to determine admission.^[139] In
   Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race
   can be used in a public university's admission policy, there must be no
   workable race-neutral alternative.^[140] In Schuette v. Coalition to
   Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the
   constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or
   local use of affirmative action.^[141]

   Reed v. Reed (1971),^[142] which struck down an Idaho probate law
   favoring men, was the first decision in which the Court ruled that
   arbitrary gender discrimination violated the Equal Protection
   Clause.^[143] In Craig v. Boren (1976),^[144] the Court ruled that
   statutory or administrative sex classifications had to be subjected to
   an intermediate standard of judicial review.^[145] Reed and Craig later
   served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws
   discriminating by gender.^[143]

   Since Wesberry v. Sanders (1964)^[146] and Reynolds v. Sims
   (1964),^[147] the Supreme Court has interpreted the Equal Protection
   Clause as requiring the states to apportion their congressional
   districts and state legislative seats according to "one man, one
   vote".^[148] The Court has also struck down redistricting plans in
   which race was a key consideration. In Shaw v. Reno (1993),^[149] the
   Court prohibited a North Carolina plan aimed at creating majority-black
   districts to balance historic underrepresentation in the state's
   congressional delegations.^[150]

   The Equal Protection Clause served as the basis for the decision in
   Bush v. Gore (2000),^[151] in which the Court ruled that no
   constitutionally valid recount of Florida's votes in the 2000
   presidential election could be held within the needed deadline; the
   decision effectively secured Bush's victory in the disputed
   election.^[152] In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry
   (2006),^[153] the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's
   Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and
   thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.^[154]

State action/State actor doctrine

   Main article: State actor

   Individual liberties guaranteed by the United States Constitution
   protect, with exception of the Thirteenth Amendment’s ban on slavery,
   not against actions by private persons or entities, but only against
   actions by government officials.^[155] Regarding the Fourteenth
   Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1
   (1948): "[T]he action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth
   Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the
   States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct,
   however discriminatory or wrongful." The court added in Civil Rights
   Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883): "It is State action of a particular character
   that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the
   subject matter of the amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It
   nullifies and makes void all State legislation, and State action of
   every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of
   the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or property
   without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal
   protection of the laws."

   Vindication of federal constitutional rights are limited to those
   situations where there is “state action” meaning action of government
   officials who are exercising their governmental power.^[155] In Ex
   parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1880), the Supreme Court found that the
   prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment "have reference to actions of
   the political body denominated by a State, by whatever instruments or
   in whatever modes that action may be taken. A State acts by its
   legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in
   no other way. The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that
   no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers
   are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
   protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a
   State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty,
   without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal
   protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as
   he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's
   power, his act is that of the State."^[156]

   There are however instances where people are the victims of
   civil-rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both
   government officials and private actors.^[155] In the 1960s, the United
   States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action opening
   the door to wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors
   when they act as state actors^[155] (i.e., acts done or otherwise
   "sanctioned in some way" by the state). The Court found that the state
   action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or
   immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.^[113]

   The critical factor in determining the existence of state action is not
   governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations,
   but "the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus
   between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so
   that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the
   State itself."^[156] "Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances
   can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be
   attributed its true significance."^[157]

   The Supreme Court asserted that plaintiffs must establish not only that
   a private party "acted under color of the challenged statute, but also
   that its actions are properly attributable to the State. [...]" ^[158]
   "And the actions are to be attributable to the State apparently only if
   the State compelled the actions and not if the State merely established
   the process through statute or regulation under which the private party
   acted."^[113]

   The rules developed by the Supreme Court for business regulation are
   that (1) the "mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation
   does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for
   purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment,"^[a] and (2) "a State normally
   can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has
   exercised coercive power or has provided such significant
   encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must be deemed
   to be that of the State."^[b]

Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives

   Section 2 altered the way each state's representation in the House of
   Representatives is determined. It counts all residents for
   apportionment, overriding Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the
   Constitution, which counted only three-fifths of each state's slave
   population.

   Section 2 also reduces a state's apportionment if it wrongfully denies
   any adult male's right to vote. However, Section 2 was never enforced
   and so Southern states continued to use pretexts to prevent many blacks
   from voting until the passage of Voting Rights Act of 1965.^[159]
   Abolitionist leaders criticized the amendment's failure to specifically
   prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis
   of race.^[160] Section 2 protects the right to vote only of adult
   males, not adult females, making it the only provision of the
   Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex.^[30]
   Section 2 was condemned by women's suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady
   Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who had long seen their cause as linked
   to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from
   women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.^[161]

   Some have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the
   Fifteenth Amendment,^[162] but the Supreme Court acknowledged the
   provisions of Section 2 in some later decisions. For example, in
   Richardson v. Ramirez (1974), the Court cited Section 2 as justifying
   the states disenfranchising felons.^[163] In Hunter v. Underwood
   (1985), a case involving disenfranchising black misdemeanants, the
   Supreme Court concluded that the Tenth Amendment cannot save
   legislation prohibited by the subsequently enacted Fourteenth
   Amendment. More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with
   a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the
   Equal Protection Clause by the "other crime" provision of Section 2.
   The Court held that Section 2 "was not designed to permit the
   purposeful racial discrimination [...] which otherwise violates
   [Section] 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment."^[164]

Participants in rebellion

   Section 3 prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state
   office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then
   engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason. However, a two-thirds
   vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation. In
   1898, the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3's
   limitation.^[165] In 1975, the citizenship of Confederate general
   Robert E. Lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution,
   retroactive to June 13, 1865.^[166] In 1978, pursuant to Section 3, the
   Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate
   president Jefferson Davis.^[167]

   Section 3 was used to prevent Socialist Party of America member Victor
   L. Berger, convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his
   anti-militarist views, from taking his seat in the House of
   Representatives in 1919 and 1920.^[168]

Validity of public debt

   Section 4 confirmed the legitimacy of all public debt appropriated by
   the Congress. It also confirmed that neither the United States nor any
   state would pay for the loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred
   by the Confederacy. For example, during the Civil War several British
   and French banks had lent large sums of money to the Confederacy to
   support its war against the Union.^[169] In Perry v. United States
   (1935), the Supreme Court ruled that under Section 4 voiding a United
   States bond "went beyond the congressional power."^[170]

   The debt-ceiling crises of 2011 and 2013 raised the question of what
   powers Section 4 gives to the President.^[171]^[172] Some, such as
   legal scholar Garrett Epps, fiscal expert Bruce Bartlett and Treasury
   Secretary Timothy Geithner, have argued that a debt ceiling may be
   unconstitutional and therefore void as long as it interferes with the
   duty of the government to pay interest on outstanding bonds and to make
   payments owed to pensioners (that is, Social Security
   recipients).^[173]^[174] Legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen has argued that
   Section 4 gives the President unilateral authority to raise or ignore
   the national debt ceiling, and that if challenged the Supreme Court
   would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss the
   case altogether for lack of standing.^[175] Erwin Chemerinsky,
   professor and dean at University of California, Irvine School of Law,
   has argued that not even in a "dire financial emergency" could the
   President raise the debt ceiling as "there is no reasonable way to
   interpret the Constitution that [allows him to do so]".^[176] Jack
   Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale University,
   opined that like Congress the President is bound by the Fourteenth
   Amendment, for otherwise he could violate the amendment sections at
   will. Because the President must obey the Section 4 requirement not to
   put the validity of the public debt into question, Balkin argued that
   President Obama is obliged "to prioritize incoming revenues to pay the
   public debt: interest on government bonds and any other 'vested'
   obligations. What falls into the latter category is not entirely clear,
   but a large number of other government obligations—and certainly
   payments for future services—would not count and would have to be
   sacrificed. This might include, for example, Social Security
   payments."^[172]

Power of enforcement

   Main article: Congressional power of enforcement

   Section 5, also known as the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth
   Amendment, enables Congress to pass laws enforcing the amendment's
   other provisions.^[177]^[178] In the Civil Rights Cases (1883),^[26]
   the Supreme Court interpreted Section 5 narrowly, stating that "the
   legislation which Congress is authorized to adopt in this behalf is not
   general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective
   legislation". In other words, the amendment authorizes Congress to pass
   laws only to combat violations of the rights protected in other
   sections.^[179]

   In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966),^[180] the Court upheld Section 4(e) of
   the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits certain forms of
   literacy requirements as a condition to vote, as a valid exercise of
   Congressional power under Section 5 to enforce the Equal Protection
   Clause. The Court ruled that Section 5 enabled Congress to act both
   remedially and prophylactically to protect the rights guaranteed by the
   amendment.^[181] However, in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997),^[182] the
   Court narrowed Congress's enforcement power, holding that Congress may
   not enact legislation under Section 5 that substantively defines or
   interprets Fourteenth Amendment rights.^[177] The Court ruled that
   legislation is valid under Section 5 only if there is a "congruence and
   proportionality" between the injury to a person's Fourteenth Amendment
   right and the means Congress adopted to prevent or remedy that
   injury.^[183]

       Senator Reverdy Johnson said in the debate: "Now, all this
       amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States
       and not subject to some foreign Power--for that, no doubt, is the
       meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before
       us--shall be considered as citizens of the United States...If there
       are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the
       character of citizens of the United States, there should be some
       certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the
       character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and
       the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of
       no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth
       within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at
       the time were subject to the authority of the United States."

       Trumbull, during the debate, said, "What do we [the committee
       reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the
       United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what
       it means." He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by
       "complete jurisdiction": "Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in
       court?...We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not
       subject to our jurisdiction.... If we want to control the Navajoes,
       or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has
       spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they
       subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?.... Would he [Sen.
       Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves
       their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United
       States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and
       other crimes committed by one Indian upon another?... It is only
       those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are
       subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens."

       Howard additionally stated the word jurisdiction meant "the same
       jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of
       the United States now" and that the U.S. possessed a "full and

       Amendment of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents",
       Congressional Research Service (August 12, 2010): "Over the last
       decade or so, concern about illegal immigration has sporadically
       led to a re- examination of a long-established tenet of U.S.
       citizenship, codified in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth
       Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and §301(a) of the Immigration
       and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. §1401(a)), that a person who is
       born in the United States, subject to its jurisdiction, is a
       citizen of the United States regardless of the race, ethnicity, or
       alienage of the parents. [...] "some scholars argue that the
       Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should not apply to
       the children of unauthorized aliens because the problem of
       unauthorized aliens did not exist at the time the Fourteenth
       Amendment was considered in Congress and ratified by the states."

       The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following
       exchange:
       Mr. Cowan: "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of
       naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this
       country?"
       Mr. Trumbull: "Undoubtedly."
       ...
       Mr. Trumbull: "I understand that under the naturalization laws the
       children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized
       are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present
       time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a
       citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the
       counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German
       parents are not citizens."
       Mr. Cowan: "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the
       fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are
       not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor
       anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."
       Mr. Trumbull: "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the
       law any distinction made between the children of German parents and
       the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the
       point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and
       the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child
       of a European."
   52. ^ Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 2891.
       From the debate on the Civil Rights Act:
       Mr. Cowan: "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that
       everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to
       be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides
       Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being
       much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I
       look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from
       California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow
       citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and
       I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State
       and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit,
       they may be userful; but I would not tie their hands by the
       Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter
       from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."

       From the debate on the Civil Rights Act:
       Mr. Johnson: "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open
       question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the
       commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State
       becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no
       definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States
       except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..."

       2891-2 During the debate on the Amendment, Senator John Conness of
       California declared, "The proposition before us, I will say, Mr.
       President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten
       of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare
       that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the
       Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same
       provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in
       favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the
       children of all parentage, whatever, born in California, should be
       regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to
       equal Civil Rights with other citizens.".
