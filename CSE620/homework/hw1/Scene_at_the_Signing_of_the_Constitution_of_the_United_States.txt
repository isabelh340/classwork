   Howard Chandler Christy's Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of
   the United States
   Key to figures in the painting

   Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States is a
   famous oil-on-canvas painting by Howard Chandler Christy, depicting the
   Constitutional Convention signing the U.S. Constitution at Independence
   Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787. Along with Washington
   Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, the painting is one of the
   most famous depictions of the early days of the United States. Christy
   created the painting in April 1940; it is so large that he painted it
   in a sail loft. It currently is displayed along the east stairway in
   the House of Representatives wing in the Capitol building.

Description[edit]

   Only 40 of the 55 delegates are pictured in the painting; not included
   are the three delegates who did not sign the Constitution or the 13
   delegates who left the convention. On the right side of the painting,
   on the dais, is George Washington, president of the Convention,
   standing upright and looking out over the delegates. The Constitution
   is on a desk before him, and Richard Spaight of North Carolina is
   signing the document. The windows are open and an aura of light
   surrounds Washington's upper body. Behind him is a display of American
   flags and a drum. Behind him are James Wilson of Pennsylvania and
   Richard Bassett of Delaware, talking with each other. Behind them on
   the far right is another Delaware delegate, George Read; below them is
   the another Pennsylvania delegate, Robert Morris. Slightly to the right
   of Washington is the standing Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer from
   Maryland. William Jackson, the Convention's secretary, is unusually
   prominent in the painting, directly in the center, standing, in red,
   apparently counting their votes and acknowledging their wish to sign
   the Constitution. At his left elbow, James Madison observes the
   proceedings. Between Jackson's right hand and head is William Paterson.
   Seated in the center is the eighty-one-year-old Benjamin Franklin, and
   Alexander Hamilton leaning toward him. Standing directly behind
   Hamilton is Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania. The South Carolina
   delegation is depicted in the left corner of the painting. Seated in
   the left of the painting is the twenty-six year old Jonathan Dayton,
   with Rufus King on his left and Nathaniel Gorham on his right. They are
   easily distinguished by their multi-colored silk coats.

Commissioning[edit]

   Representative Sol Bloom, the Director General of the United States
   Constitution Sesquicentennial Commission, first proposed that the
   painting be commissioned in 1937 as part of the 150th anniversary of
   the Constitution. Howard Chandler Christy, one of the most popular
   illustrators and portrait painters of the time, had created an
   historically accurate scene of the signing for the Commission to
   reproduce. His first small painting included a maiden representing "We
   the People" and numerous other symbolic figures, but these were
   eliminated in the final version. In the three years during which
   Representative Bloom worked with Christy to locate early portraits of
   the signers and to fill in historical details, he became aware that
   there was no scene of the signing of the Constitution in the U.S.
   Capitol, and few other paintings in existence included all the signers.

   A Joint Resolution was first introduced in the House in 1937 to pay
   Christy $35,000 to paint Signing of the Constitution. Heated debate
   arose, however: some members of Congress were in favor of memorializing
   one of the greatest events in American history, but others held deep
   reservations about spending the funds for art during a period of severe
   economic depression, and the bill did not pass. The Joint Resolution
   failed again in 1938.

   Finally, in 1939, a modified resolution, P.R. 11, 76th Congress, was
   accepted to set up a commission consisting of the Vice President, the
   Speaker of the House, and the Architect of the Capitol to employ an
   artist to paint a 20-by-30-foot scene of the signing at a price of
   $30,000. The contract with Christy was signed on July 24, 1939. On
   October 29, 1940, the Congress approved $1500 for the purchase of a
   frame, which was accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library on
   December 26, 1940.

Research and work[edit]

   To achieve the greatest possible accuracy, Christy searched for
   portraits by the best artists of the late 18th and early 19th
   centuries, such as Charles Willson Peale and Gilbert Stuart. He located
   portraits of thirty-seven out of the thirty-nine delegates and the
   Secretary, William Jackson. Christy took some liberties in composing
   his scene: John Dickinson, whose signature was added by proxy, is
   included, and three men who were present but did not sign are not
   shown. He obscured the faces of the two signers (Thomas FitzSimons and
   Jacob Broom) of whom no portraits were found. He also researched
   authentic costumes, including a pair of George Washington’s breeches
   borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution, and he depicted the
   furniture and artifacts used by the delegates. The books beside
   Franklin’s chair were part of Thomas Jefferson’s library; Christy
   borrowed them from the Rare Book Room of the Library of Congress and
   included them in the scene to acknowledge Jefferson’s importance to the
   Constitution. He made the sketch for the painting in Independence Hall
   in September, at the same time of day as the signing, to show
   accurately the angle of sunlight in the room with its glass chandelier.
   The artist said that the flags he depicted are the Stars and Stripes,
   one from a Maryland dragoon regiment, and regimental colors from
   Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

   The huge 18-by-26-foot canvas was painted in the sail loft of the
   Washington Navy Yard, where Christy at times used enlisted men as
   models for the figures. After five years of research and seven months
   of painting, the canvas was dedicated in May 1940 in the Rotunda of the
   Capitol, where it was on view for 16 months. The 20-by-30-foot frame,
   made in nine sections including the central eagle and crest, was hand
   carved and given a gold-leaf finish by Azeglio Pancani of New York.
   After much debate about where it could be hung, another painting was
   moved and the Christy in its frame was installed in the east grand
   stairway of the House, where it remains today.

Vandalism and restoration[edit]

   In 1967 the painting was vandalized by being slashed along the bottom;
   the canvas had to be removed from the stretcher to be transported for
   repair in 1968. The fills made then were apparent, however, and over
   time dust, grime, and yellowed varnish obscured the original brilliant
   colors. In 2006 the painting was cleaned and conserved in place by
   conservators working from a large four-level scaffold from mid-October
   through December. The cleaning of areas that had looked dull brown
   revealed lively expressions; detailed costumes; and impressionist
   colors, such as lavender and pink, applied with scintillating
   brushwork. The vandalized area was given special attention and is now
   barely visible. Finally, a new coating of clear protective varnish was
   applied.

   The frame, which had been covered with bronze powder paint in 1968, was
   taken apart in sections and conserved off site. It was cleaned and
   repaired, regilded with 22-karat gold leaf similar to the color of the
   original metal leaf, and toned to complement the painting.
