Immigration[edit]

Earlier Colonial era[edit]

   Nearly all commercial activity was run in small privately owned
   businesses with good credit both at home and in England being essential
   since they were often cash poor. Most settlements were nearly
   independent of trade with Britain as most grew or made nearly
   everything they needed—the average cost of imports per most households
   was only about 5-15 English pounds per year. Most settlements were
   created by complete family groups with several generations often
   present in each settlement. Probably close to 80% of the families owned
   the land they lived and farmed on. They nearly all used English Common
   Law as their basic code of law and, except for the Dutch and Germans,
   spoke some dialect of English. They established their own popularly
   elected governments and courts and were, within a few years, mostly
   self-governing, self-supporting and self-replicating.

   Nearly all colonies and, later, states in the United States were
   settled by migration from another colony or state, as foreign
   immigration usually only played a minor role after the first initial
   settlements were started. Many new immigrants did end up on the
   frontiers as that was where the land was usually the cheapest.

New England[edit]

   The New England colonists included more educated men as well as many
   skilled farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen. They were mostly farmers and
   settled in small villages for common religious activity. Shipbuilding,
   commerce, and fisheries were important in coastal towns. New England's
   healthy climate (the cold winters killed the mosquitoes and other
   disease-bearing insects), and abundant food supply resulted in the
   lowest death rate and highest birth rate of any place in the world
   (marriage was expected and birth control was not, and a much higher
   than average number of children and mothers survived).

   The eastern and northern frontier around the initial New England
   settlements was mainly settled by the Yankee descendants of the
   original New Englanders. Emigration to the New England colonies after
   1640 and the start of the English Civil War decreased to less than 1%
   (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all years prior to 1845. The
   rapid growth of the New England colonies (total population ~700,000 by
   1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate (>3%) and low
   death rate (<1%) per year.

Middle Colonies[edit]

   The middle colonies' settlements were scattered west of New York City,
   New York (est. 1626 by Dutch, taken over by the English in 1664) and
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (est. 1682). The Dutch-started colony of New
   York had the most eclectic collection of residents from many different
   nations and prospered as a major trading and commercial center after
   about 1700. The Pennsylvania colonial center was dominated by the
   Quakers for decades after they emigrated there, mainly from the North
   Midlands of England, from about 1680 to 1725. The main commercial
   center of Philadelphia was run mostly by prosperous Quakers,
   supplemented by many small farming and trading communities with strong
   German contingents located in the Delaware River valley.

   Many more settlers arrived in the middle colonies starting in about
   1680, when Pennsylvania was founded and many Protestant sects were
   encouraged to settle there for freedom of religion and good, cheap
   land. These settlers were of about 60% British and 33% German
   extraction. By 1780 in New York about 17% of the population were
   descendants of Dutch settlers. The rest were mostly English with a wide
   mixture of other Europeans and about 6% Blacks. New Jersey and Delaware
   had a majority of British with 7-11% German-descended colonists, about
   a 6% black population, and a small contingent of Swedish descendants of
   New Sweden. Nearly all were at least third-generation natives.

Frontier[edit]

   The colonial western frontier was mainly settled from about 1717 to
   1775 by mostly Presbyterian settlers from northern England border
   lands, Scotland, and the northern portion of Ireland, fleeing bad times
   and persecution in those areas. Most initially landed in family groups
   in Philadelphia or Baltimore but soon migrated to the western frontier
   where land was cheaper and restrictions less onerous.

Natural growth[edit]

   All the colonies, after they were started, grew mostly by natural
   growth, with foreign born populations rarely exceeding 10% in isolated
   instances. The last significant colonies to be settled mainly by
   immigrants were Pennsylvania in the early 18th century and Georgia and
   the Borderlands in the late 18th century, as migration (not
   immigration) continued to provide nearly all the settlers for each new
   colony or state. This pattern would continue throughout U.S. history.
   The extent of colonial settlements by 1800 is shown by this map from
   the University of Texas map collection.^[3]

    1. Maine was part of Massachusetts from about 1652 to 1820, when it
       was granted statehood.
    2. New Hampshire was part of Massachusetts until about 1685, when it
       was split off and established under a British appointed governor.
       It was one of the original 13 colonies.
    3. Vermont was contested between the French and British settlers until
       the French and Indian war (1758–1765) drove out the French
       authorities. The territory was then disputed between Massachusetts,
       New York and New Hampshire until the settlers declared their
       independence from all of them and were accepted as the 14th state
       in 1791 and participated in the 1790 census a year late.
    4. Plymouth, Massachusetts despite being the first permanent New
       England settlement, lost its charter in 1690 and became part of the
       Massachusetts colony.
    5. By 1784 all slavery in the New England states was either completely
       prohibited or transitioning to its total prohibition.
    6. By 1804 all slavery in the Middle colonies (except Delaware [6.6%
       Black]) was either completely prohibited or was transitioning to
       its total prohibition.
    7. All slavery was prohibited in the entire U.S. in 1865 by the 13th
       amendment to the constitution.

Population in 1790[edit]

   According to the source, The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy
   by Kory L. Meyerink and Loretto Dennis Szucs, the following were the
   countries of origin for new arrivals coming to the United States before
   1790. The regions marked * were part of Great Britain. The ancestry of
   the 3.9 million population in 1790 has been estimated by various
   sources by sampling last names in the 1790 census and assigning them a
   country of origin. The Irish in the 1790 census were mostly Scots
   Irish. The French were mostly Huguenots. The total U.S. Catholic
   population in 1790 was probably less than 5%. The Indian population
   inside territorial U.S. 1790 boundaries was less than 100,000.

       immigrants. Population from US 1790 Census
    3. Germany in this time period consists of a large number of separate
       countries, the largest of which was Prussia.
    4. Jewish settlers were from several European countries.
    5. The Other category probably contains mostly English ancestry
       settlers; but the loss of several states detailed census records in
       the Burning of Washington D.C. in the War of 1812 makes estimating
       closer difficult. Nearly all states that lost their 1790 (and 1800)
       census records have tried to reconstitute their original census
       from tax records etc. with various degrees of success. The
       summaries of the 1790 and 1800 census from all states survived.
    6. The Total is the total immigration over the approximately 130 year
       span of colonial existence of the U.S. colonies as found in the
       1790 census. Many of the colonists, especially from the New England
       colonies, are already into their fifth generation of being in
       America. At the time of the American Revolution the foreign born
       population is estimated to be from 300,000 to 400,000.

   The 1790 population already reflected the approximate 50,000
   “Loyalists” who emigrated to Canada at the end of the American
   Revolution and the fewer than 10,000 more who emigrated to other
   British territories.

   Already by 1790 the ancestry question was starting to become irrelevant
   to many, as intermarriage from different ethnic groups was becoming
   common, causing people to form a common American identity. The total
   white population in 1790 was about 80% of British ancestry, and would
   go on to roughly double by natural increase every 25 years. From about
   1675 onward, the native-born population of what would become the United
   States would never again drop below 85% of the total.

Immigration 1790 to 1849[edit]

   In the early years of the U.S., immigration was only about 6000 people
   a year on average, including French refugees from the slave revolt in
   Haiti. The French Revolution, starting in 1789, and the Napoleonic Wars
   from 1792 to 1814 severely limited immigration from Europe. The War of
   1812 (1812–1814) with Britain again prevented any significant
   immigration. By 1808 Congress had banned the importation of slaves,
   slowing that human traffic to a trickle.

   After 1820 immigration gradually increased. For the first time federal
   records, including ship passenger lists, were kept for immigration.
   Total immigration for the year 1820 was 8,385, gradually building to
   23,322 by 1830, with 143,000 total immigrating during the intervening
   decade. From 1831 to 1840 immigration increased greatly, to 599,000
   total, as 207,000 Irish, even before the famine of 1845-49, started to
   emigrate in large numbers as Britain eased travel restrictions. 152,000
   Germans, 76,000 British, and 46,000 French formed the next largest
   immigrant groups in that decade.

   From 1841 to 1850 immigration exploded to 1,713,000 total immigrants
   and at least 781,000 Irish, with the famine of 1845-1849 driving them,
   fled their homeland to escape poverty and death. In attempting to
   divert some of this traffic to help settle Canada, the British offered
   bargain fares of 15 shillings for transit to Canada, instead of the
   normal 5 pounds (100 shillings). Thousands of poor Irish took advantage
   of this offer and headed to Canada on what came to be called the
   "coffin ships" because of their high death rates. Once in Canada, many
   Irish walked across the border or caught an intercoastal freighter to
   the nearest major city in the United States - usually Boston or New
   York.

   Bad potato crops and failed revolutions struck the heart of Europe in
   1848, contributing to the decade's total of 435,000 Germans, 267,000
   British and 77,000 French immigrants to America. Bad times in Europe
   drove people out; land, relatives, freedom, opportunity, and jobs in
   America lured them in.

   1850 23,054,000 1,713,000 2,244,000 9.7%

   The number of immigrants from 1830 on are from immigration records. The
   census of 1850 was the first census in which place of birth was asked.
   It is probably a reasonable estimate that the foreign born population
   in the U.S. reached its minimum in about 1815 at something like
   100,000, or 1.4% of the population. By 1815 most of the immigrants that
   arrived before the American Revolution had passed on, and there had
   been almost no new immigration.
    1. The total number immigrating in each decade from 1790 to 1820 are
       estimates.
    2. The number foreign born in 1830 and 1840 decades are
       extrapolations.

   Nearly all population growth up to 1830 was by internal increase; about
   98.5% of the population was native-born. By 1850, this had shifted to
   about 90% native-born. The first significant Catholic immigration
   started in the mid-1840s.

Migration within the United States[edit]

The American West[edit]

   In 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, concluding the Mexican War,
   extended U.S. citizenship to approximately 60,000 Mexican residents of
   the New Mexico Territory and 10,000 living in California. However, much
   like Texas, the Mexican government had encouraged immigration and
   settlement of these regions from groups in the United States and
   Europe. Approximately half of this population is estimated to have been
   of American origin. In 1849, the California Gold Rush spurred
   significant immigration from Mexico, South America, China, Australia,
   Europe and caused a mass migration within the US, resulting in
   California gaining statehood in 1850, with a population of about
   90,000.

Rural flight[edit]

   Census Bureau population change in the United States 1960-2000.jpg

   Rural flight is the departure of excess populations (usually young men
   and women) from farm areas. In some cases whole families left, as in
   the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Much of rural America has seen steady
   population decline since 1920.

Black migration out of the South[edit]

   The Great Migration was the movement of millions African Americans out
   of the rural Southern United States from 1914 to 1960. Most moved to
   large industrial cities, as well as to many smaller industrial cities.
   African-Americans moved as individuals or small groups. There was no
   government assistance. They migrated because of a variety of push and
   pull factors:

Push factors[edit]

    1. Many African-Americans wanted to avoid the racial segregation of
       the Jim Crow South and sought refuge in the supposed "Promised
       Land" of the North where there was thought to be less segregation
    2. The boll weevil infestation of the cotton fields of the South in
       the late 1910s, reduced the demand for sharecroppers.
    3. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and its aftermath displaced
       hundreds of thousands of African-American farm workers;

Pull factors[edit]

    1. Income levels were much higher in the North, with far higher wages
       in the service sector.
    2. The enormous growth of war industries in WW1 and WW2 created new
       job openings for blacks
    3. World War I effectively put a halt to the flow of European
       immigrants to the industrial centers, causing shortages of workers
       in the factories.
    4. In the 1930s Works Progress Administration, Civilian Conservation
       Corps and other relief programs in the North were more receptive to
       blacks. The WPA paid more in the North.
    5. After 1940, as the U.S. rearmed for World War II (see
       Homefront-United States-World War II), industrial production
       increased rapidly.
    6. The FEPC equal opportunity laws were more enforced in the North and
       West.^[5]

Recent demographic trends[edit]

Post-war baby boom[edit]

   United States birth rate (births per 1000 population).^[6] The United
   States Census Bureau defines the demographic birth boom as between 1946
   and 1964^[7] (blue).

   In the years after WWII, the United States, as well as a number of
   other industrialized countries, experienced an unexpected sudden birth
   rate jump. The cause of the baby boom was millions of men from the US
   who had to fight in WWII which prevented women from starting families
   and women also had to take the place of men in the workplace. The
   millions of men coming back and couples eager to start families led to
   a sharp rise in the US birth rate. Since the men who came back got jobs
   in the workplace again, women became strongly pressured to once again
   stay home to take care of the house and children and let their husbands
   be the breadwinner of the household.^[citation needed] Women felt great
   pressure to be married by her early 20s or else she would be considered
   lonely later on in life.^[citation needed]

   During the baby boom years, between 1946 and 1964, the birth rate
   doubled for third children and tripled for fourth children.^[8]

   The total fertility rate of the United States jumped from 2.49 in 1945
   to 2.94 in 1946, a rise of 0.45 children therefore beginning the baby
   boom. It continued to rise throughout the 1940s to reach 3.10 in 1950
   with a peak of 3.77 in 1957. Declining slowly thereafter to 3.65 in
   1960 and finally a steep from decline after 1964, therefore ending the
   baby boom.

   The number of children aged 0–4 sprouted to 16,410,000 in 1950 from
   11,000,000 in 1940, it continued into the 1960s where it peaked at
   20,000,000 children under the age of 5.

   The number of children under 19 rose to 69 million in 1960 from 51
   million in 1950, a 35.3% increase, while the proportion of the
   population rose to 38.8% up from 33.8% in 1950.

Marriages[edit]

   According to statistics, the United States currently has the highest
   marriage rate in the developed world, as of 2008, with a marriage rate
   of 7.1 per 1,000 people or 2,162,000 marriages. The average age for
   first marriage for men is 27.4 and 25.6 years for women.
   http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_19.htm The United
   States also has one of the highest proportions of people who do marry
   by age 40, which approximately 85% Americans are married at 40,
   compared to only 60% in Sweden.

   During the 1930s, the number of marriages and the marriage rate dropped
   steeply due to the Great Depression, but rebounded almost immediately
   after the Depression ended. Marriage rates increased and remained at
   high levels in the late 1930 to the mid-1940s. The number of marriages
   shot up to reach over 2 million in 1946, with a marriage rate of 16.4
   per 1,000 people as WWII had ended. The average age at first marriage
   for both men and women began to fall after WWII, dropping 22.8 for men
   and 20.3 for women in 1950 and dropping even more to 22.5 and 20.1
   years in 1956. In 1959, the United States Census Bureau estimated that
   47% of all brides marrying for their first time were teenagers aged 19
   and under. In 1955, 51.2% of women were married by their 20th birthday
   and 88% by their 25th birthday; 40.3% of men and 28.5% of women aged
   20–24 in 1955 had never married, down from 77.8% for men and 57.4% for
   women in 1940.

   As of 2002, 4.3% of men and 18.1% of women aged 20 are married,
   increasing to 37% of men and 52% of women by age 25, and then 61% of
   men and 76% of women by age 30.

Population growth projections[edit]

   The U.S. population in 1900 was 76 million. In 1950, it rose to 152
   million; by 2000 it had reached 282 million. By 2050, it is expected to
   reach 420 million.

Demographic models in Historiography[edit]

Easterlin models[edit]

   Richard Easterlin, an economist who has researched economic growth in
   the United States, explains the growth pattern of American population
   in the 20th century through fertility rate fluctuations and the
   decreasing mortality rate. Easterlin has attempted to explain the cause
   of the Baby Boom and Baby Bust through the “relative income” theory.
   The “relative income” theory suggests that couples choose to have
   children based on a couple’s ratio of potential earning power and the
   desire to obtain material objects. This ratio depends on the economic
   stability of the country in which they live and how people are raised
   to value material objects. The “relative income” theory explains the
   Baby Boom by suggesting that the late 1940s and 1950s brought low
   desires to have material objects, as a result of the Great Depression
   and WWII, as well as huge job opportunities, because of it being a post
   war period. These two factors gave rise to a high relative income,
   which encouraged high fertility. Following this period, the next
   generation had a greater desire for material objects; however, an
   economic slowdown in the United States made jobs harder to acquire.
   This resulted in lower fertility rates, causing the Baby Bust.

State trends[edit]

   Between 1880 and 1900, the urban population of the United States rose
   from 28% to 40% (1), and reached 50% by 1920, in part due to 9,000,000
   European immigrants. After 1890 the US rural population began to
   plummet, as farmers were displaced by mechanization and forced to
   migrate to urban factory jobs. After World War II, the US experienced a
   shift away from the cities, mostly due to the gaining popularity of the
   automobile and heavy government funding of suburban housing and
   highways. Many of the original manufacturing cities lost as much as
   half their populations between 1950 and 1980. There was a shift in the
   population from the dense city centers filled with apartments,
   row-homes, and tenements; to less dense suburban neighborhoods outside
   the cities which were filled with single family homes.

Arizona[edit]

   In the 1990s, Arizona's rural population grew by 29% while the rural
   retiree population grew by 43%.

Colorado[edit]

   During the 1990s, Colorado's rural working-age population grew by 40%
   and the rural retiree population grew by 23%. The statewide population
   grew 31%, the statewide retiree population grew by 27%, and the
   statewide working-age population grew by 31%.

Florida[edit]

   In the 1990s, the population of Florida's rural counties grew 25%. The
   state's rural retiree population grew 28%. The overall population
   increased by 24%, while the retiree population increased 19%. It is
   projected to surpass New York as the third-most-populous state between
   2009 and 2014.

Illinois[edit]

   During the 1990s the rural population of Illinois increased by 1%,
   while the population of Chicago, Illinois increased 12%.

Kansas[edit]

   During the 1990s the rural population of Kansas increased by 2%, while
   the statewide increase was 9%.

Minnesota[edit]

   During the 1990s, the population of Minnesota increased 12%. The
   working-age population increased 14% and the retiree population
   increased 9%.

North Dakota[edit]

   In the 1990s, the rural population of North Dakota decreased 6% while
   the overall population remained constant.

Washington[edit]

   During the 1990s, Washington's rural population grew by 20%. Meanwhile,
   the rural working-age population grew 22% and the rural retiree
   population grew 16%. Overall there was 21% growth, with 23% for
   statewide working-age populations and 15% for retirees.
