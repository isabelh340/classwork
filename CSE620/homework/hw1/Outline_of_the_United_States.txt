Physiographic divisions of the United States[edit]

   The geography of the United States varies across their immense area.
   Within the contential U.S., eight distinct physiographic divisions
   exist, though each is composed of several smaller physiographic
   subdivisions.^[2] These major divisions are:
     * Laurentian Upland - part of the Canadian Shield that extends into
       the northern United States Great Lakes area.
     * Atlantic Plain - the coastal regions of the eastern and southern
       parts includes the continental shelf, the Atlantic Coast and the

   At the Declaration of Independence, the United States consisted of 13
   states, former colonies of the United Kingdom. In the following years,
   the number of states has grown steadily due to expansion to the west,
   conquest and purchase of lands by the American government, and division
   of existing states to the current number of 50 United States:
