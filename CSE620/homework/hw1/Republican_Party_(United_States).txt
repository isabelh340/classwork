   Political parties
   Elections

   The Republican Party, also commonly called the GOP (abbreviation for
   Grand Old Party), is one of the two major contemporary political
   parties in the United States, the other being the Democratic Party.
   Founded by anti-slavery activists in 1854, it dominated politics
   nationally for most of the period from 1860 to 1932. There have been 18
   Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, serving from
   1861 to 1865, and the most recent being George W. Bush, serving from
   2001 to 2009. The most recent Republican presidential nominee was
   former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2012.

   The party's platform is generally based upon American
   conservatism,^[7]^[8]^[9] in contrast to the Democratic Party, which
   supports contemporary American liberalism. The Republican Party's
   platform of conservatism traces its roots to classical liberalism with
   an emphasis on its economically liberal policies in supporting free
   markets, limited government, and laissez-faire economics, while
   supporting socially conservative policies.^[10]^[11] A significant
   portion of the Republican base is made up of neoliberals and other free
   market, pro-capitalism factions.^[12] The party rejects the social
   liberalism and Keynesian economics of the Democratic Party that is
   rooted in New Deal liberalism^[12]

   In the 113th Congress, elected in 2012, the Republican Party holds a
   majority of seats in the United States House of Representatives and a
   minority of seats in the United States Senate. The party holds the
   majority of governorships as well as the majority of state
   legislatures.

History

   Main article: History of the United States Republican Party

Founding and 19th century

   Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican U.S. President (1861–1865).

   Founded in the Northern states in 1854 by anti-slavery activists,
   modernizers, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers, the Republican Party
   quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant Southern
   Democratic Party and the briefly popular Know Nothing Party. The main
   cause was opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which repealed the
   Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The
   Northern Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The
   first public meeting where the name "Republican" was suggested for a
   new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854 in a schoolhouse in
   Ripon, Wisconsin.^[13] The name was partly chosen to pay homage to
   Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party.

   The first official party convention was held on July 6, 1854, in
   Jackson, Michigan.^[14] By 1858, the Republicans dominated nearly all
   Northern states. The Republican Party first came to power in 1860 with
   the election of Lincoln to the Presidency and Republicans in control of
   Congress and again, the Northern states. It oversaw the saving of the
   union, the end of slavery, and the provision of equal rights to all men
   in the American Civil War and Reconstruction, 1861–1877.^[15]

   The Republicans' initial base was in the Northeast and the upper
   Midwest. With the realignment of parties and voters in the Third Party
   System, the strong run of John C. Fremont in the 1856 Presidential
   election demonstrated it dominated most northern states.

   Early Republican ideology was reflected in the 1856 slogan "free labor,
   free land, free men", which had been coined by Salmon P. Chase, a
   Senator from Ohio (and future Secretary of the Treasury and Chief
   Justice of the United States).^[16] "Free labor" referred to the
   Republican opposition to slave labor and belief in independent artisans
   and businessmen. "Free land" referred to Republican opposition to
   plantation system whereby slaveowners could buy up all the good farm
   land, leaving the yeoman independent farmers the leftovers. The Party
   strived to contain the expansion of slavery, which would cause the
   collapse of the slave power and the expansion of freedom.^[17]

   Lincoln, representing the fast-growing western states, won the
   Republican nomination in 1860 and subsequently won the presidency. The
   party took on the mission of saving the Union and destroying slavery
   during the American Civil War and over Reconstruction. In the election
   of 1864, it united with War Democrats to nominate Lincoln on the
   National Union Party ticket.

   The party's success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s.
   Those who felt that Reconstruction had been accomplished and was
   continued mostly to promote the large-scale corruption tolerated by
   President Ulysses S. Grant ran Horace Greeley for the presidency. The
   Stalwarts defended Grant and the spoils system; the Half-Breeds pushed
   for reform of the civil service.

   The GOP supported business generally, hard money (i.e., the gold
   standard), high tariffs to promote economic growth, high wages and high
   profits, generous pensions for Union veterans, and (after 1893) the
   annexation of Hawaii. The Republicans supported the pietistic
   Protestants who demanded Prohibition. As the northern post-bellum
   economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines,
   fast-growing cities and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took
   credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth.

   Nevertheless, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the Sherman
   Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in response to
   complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high
   McKinley Tariff of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a
   landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself.

   After the two terms of Democrat Grover Cleveland, the election of
   William McKinley in 1896 is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican
   dominance and is sometimes cited as a realigning election. McKinley
   promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the
   Panic of 1893, and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in
   which all groups would benefit.

20th century

   Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of the United States (1901–1909)

   The 1896 realignment cemented the GOP as the party of big business,
   while Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his
   embrace of trust busting. He handpicked his successor William Howard
   Taft in 1908, but they became enemies on economic issues. Defeated by
   Taft for the 1912 nomination, Roosevelt bolted the party and led the
   third party ticket of the Progressive Party. The party returned to the
   White House throughout the 1920s, running on platforms of normalcy,
   business-oriented efficiency, and high tariffs. The national party
   avoided the prohibition issue after it became law in 1920.

   Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover were resoundingly
   elected in 1920, 1924, and 1928 respectively. The Teapot Dome scandal
   threatened to hurt the party but Harding died and Coolidge blamed
   everything on him, as the opposition splintered in 1924. The
   pro-business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented
   prosperity until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded the Great
   Depression.

New Deal Era

   Main articles: Old Right (United States), Fifth Party System and
   History of the United States Republican Party § Fighting the New Deal
   Coalition: 1932–1980
   Dwight Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States (1953–1961)

   The New Deal coalition of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt controlled
   American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the
   two-term presidency of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower. Blacks moved
   into the Democratic Party during the New Deal era; they could vote in
   the North but not in the South. After Roosevelt took office in 1933,
   New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economic moved
   sharply upward from the nadir in early 1933. However long-term
   unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections,
   10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25
   against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives likewise had
   overwhelming Democratic majorities.

   The GOP split into a majority "Old Right" (based in the Midwest) and a
   liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New
   Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the "Second New Deal" and said it
   represented class warfare and socialism. Roosevelt was reelected in a
   landslide in 1936 but everything went awry in his second term, as the
   economy plunged, strikes soared, and FDR failed to take control of the
   Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives in the Democratic
   party. The GOP made a major comeback in the 1938 elections, and had new
   rising stars such as Robert A. Taft of Ohio on the right and Thomas E.
   Dewey of New York on the left.^[18] Southern conservatives joined with
   most Republicans to form the conservative coalition, which dominated
   domestic issues in Congress until 1964. Both parties split on foreign
   policy issues, with the anti-war isolationists dominant in the GOP and
   the interventionists who wanted to stop Hitler dominant in the
   Democratic party. Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and
   1944. Conservatives abolished most of the New Deal during the war, but
   did not attempt to reverse Social Security or the agencies that
   regulated business.

   Historian George H. Nash argues:

          Unlike the "moderate," internationalist, largely eastern bloc of
          Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the
          "Roosevelt Revolution" and the essential premises of President
          Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was
          counterrevolutionary, anticollectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New
          Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market
          economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive)
          prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the
          start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal
          Democrats from without and "me-too" Republicans from
          within.^[19]

   The Democrats elected majorities to Congress almost continuously after
   1932 (the GOP won only in 1946 and 1952), but the Conservative
   Coalition blocked practically all major liberal proposals in domestic
   policy. After 1945, the internationalist wing of the GOP cooperated
   with Harry Truman's Cold War foreign policy, funded the Marshall Plan,
   and supported NATO, despite the continued isolationism of the Old
   Right.
   Richard Nixon, 37th President of the United States (1969–1974)
   Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States (1981–1989)

   The second half of the 20th century saw election or succession of
   Republican presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford,
   Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Eisenhower had
   defeated conservative leader Senator Robert A. Taft for the 1952
   nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the
   Eisenhower Administration. Voters liked Ike much more than they liked
   the GOP, and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate
   position. After 1970, the liberal wing faded away.^[20]

   Ever since he left office in 1989, Reagan has been the iconic
   Republican; and Republican presidential candidates frequently claim to
   share his views and aim to establish themselves and their policies as
   the more appropriate heir to his legacy.^[21] In 1994, the Party, led
   by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich campaigning on the Contract with
   America, was elected to majorities to both houses of Congress in the
   Republican Revolution. However Gingrich was unable to deliver on most
   of its promises, and after his failure to successfully impeach
   President Bill Clinton in 1998, he resigned. Since Reagan's day,
   presidential elections have been close. However the Republican
   presidential candidate won a majority of the popular vote only in 2004,
   while coming in second in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008 and 2012.

21st century

   The Senate majority lasted until 2001, when the Senate became split
   evenly but was regained in the 2002 elections. Both Republican
   majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats
   regained control in the mid-term elections of 2006. The Republican
   Party has since been defined by social conservatism, a preemptive war
   foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global
   democracy, a more powerful executive branch, supply side economics,
   support for gun ownership, and deregulation.

    George H. W. Bush, 41st President of the United States (1989–1993)

      George W. Bush, 43rd President of the United States (2001–2009)

               Father and son presidents of the United States

   In the Presidential election of 2008, the party's nominees were Senator
   John McCain, of Arizona, for President and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
   for Vice President. They were defeated by Senator Barack Obama of
   Illinois and Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. In 2009, Republicans Chris
   Christie and Bob McDonnell were elected to the governorships of New
   Jersey and Virginia.

   2010 was a year of political success for the Republicans, starting with
   the upset win of Scott Brown in the Massachusetts special Senate
   election for the seat held for many decades by the Democratic Kennedy
   brothers. In the November elections, Republicans recaptured control of
   the House, increased their number of seats in the Senate, and gained a
   majority of governorships.^[22] Additionally, Republicans took control
   of at least 19 Democratic-controlled state legislatures.^[23]

   In the Presidential election of 2012, the Republican nominees were
   former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for President, and
   Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin for Vice President. The Democrats
   nominated incumbents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The campaign focused
   largely on Obamacare and Obama's stewardship of the economy, with the
   country facing high unemployment numbers and a rising national debt
   four years after his first election. Romney and Ryan were defeated by
   Obama and Biden. In addition, in the November congressional elections,
   while Republicans lost 7 seats in the House, they retained control.
   However, Republicans were not able to gain control of the Senate,
   continuing their minority status with a net loss of 2 seats.

   By September 2014 the GOP was confident of making gains in the November
   election and perhaps taking control of the Senate by gaining six
   seats.^[24]^[25]

   The 2016 presidential campaign was already underway as the Wall Street
   Journal in September 2014 handicapped the dozen or so most prominently
   mentioned GOP "wannabes" or potential candidates. Two are policy wonks.
   Representative Paul Ryan focuses on economic policies. Senator Marco
   Rubio has dropped his previous emphasis on immigration issues, but has
   issued a long series of position papers on domestic and foreign policy.
   Two elder statesmen are waiting in the wings: former governor Jeb Bush,
   and 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Two potential nominees are
   engaged in late 2014 in rebuilding their reputation after serious
   mishaps: governors Chris Christie, and Rick Perry. Senator Ted Cruz is
   appealing to the most conservative elements by taking the position
   furthest to the right on economic, social, and national security
   issues. Three other governors are running as outsiders: Scott Walker,
   Bobby Jindall, and Mike Pence. Senator Rob Portman and former Senator
   Rick Santorum are long-shots. A unique position is held by Senator Rand
   Paul, with his distinctive strongly libertarian appeals on economics,
   foreign policy, and social issues.^[26]

Name and symbols

   1874 Nast cartoon featuring the first notable appearance of the
   Republican elephant^[28]
   The modern GOP elephant
   The current GOP logo, incorporating the Republican elephant

   The party's founding members chose the name "Republican Party" in the
   mid-1850s as homage to the values of republicanism promoted by Thomas
   Jefferson's Republican party.^[29] The idea for the name came from an
   editorial by the party's leading publicist Horace Greeley, who called
   for, "some simple name like 'Republican' [that] would more fitly
   designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission
   of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of
   slavery."^[30] The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic
   virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption.^[31]

   The term "Grand Old Party" is a traditional nickname for the Republican
   Party, and the abbreviation "GOP" is a commonly used designation. The
   term originated in 1875 in the Congressional Record, referring to the
   party associated with the successful military defense of the Union as
   "this gallant old party"; the following year in an article in the
   Cincinnati Commercial, the term was modified to "grand old party". The
   first use of the abbreviation is dated 1884.^[32]

   The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant. A political
   cartoon by Thomas Nast, published in Harper's Weekly on November 7,
   1874, is considered the first important use of the symbol.^[33] In the
   early 20th century, the usual symbol of the Republican Party in
   Midwestern states such as Indiana and Ohio was the bald eagle, as
   opposed to the Democratic rooster.

   After the 2000 election, the color red became associated with the GOP,
   although the party has not officially adopted it. That election night,
   for the first time, all of the major broadcast networks used the same
   color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee
   George W. Bush were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee
   Al Gore were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to
   political parties is unofficial and informal, they have come to be
   widely recognized by the media to represent the respective political
   parties.

Structure and composition

   Further information: Politics of the United States#Organization of
   American political parties

   The Republican National Committee (RNC) is responsible for promoting
   Republican campaign activities. It is responsible for developing and
   promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating
   fundraising and election strategy. Its current chairman is Reince
   Priebus. The chairman of the RNC is chosen by the President when the
   Republicans have the White House or otherwise by the Party's state
   committees.

   The RNC, under the direction of the party's presidential candidate,
   supervises the Republican National Convention and raises funds for
   candidates. On the local level, there are similar state committees in
   every state and most large cities, counties and legislative districts,
   but they have far less money and influence than the national body.

   The Republican House and Senate caucuses have separate fundraising and
   strategy committees. The National Republican Congressional Committee
   (NRCC) assists in House races, whilst the National Republican
   Senatorial Committee (NRSC) does so in Senate races. They each raise
   over $100 million per election cycle, and play important roles in
   recruiting strong state candidates, while the Republican Governors
   Association (RGA) assists in state gubernatorial races; in 2014 it is
   chaired by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey.^[1]

   Further information: Factions in the Republican Party (United States)

   The Republican Party includes fiscal conservatives, social
   conservatives, neoconservatives, populists, moderates, and
   libertarians. Prior to the formation of the conservative coalition,
   which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in
   the mid-1960s, the party historically advocated classical liberalism,
   paleoconservatism, and progressivism^[citation needed].

Economic policies

   Republicans strongly believe that free markets and individual
   achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity. To this
   end, they advocate in favor of laissez-faire economics, fiscal
   conservatism, and the elimination of government run welfare programs in
   favor of private sector nonprofits and encouraging personal
   responsibility.

   A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is supply
   side economics. Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were
   popularly known as Reaganomics, a term popularized during the
   Presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan. This theory holds that
   reduced income tax rates increase GDP growth and thereby generate the
   same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the
   extra growth.^[34] This belief is reflected, in part, by the party's
   long-term advocacy of tax cuts. Many Republicans consider the income
   tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates,
   which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and
   wealth. They believe private spending is usually more efficient than
   government spending. Republicans oppose the estate tax.

   Most Republicans agree there should be a "safety net" to assist the
   less fortunate; however, they tend to believe the private sector is
   more effective in helping the poor than government is; as a result,
   Republicans support giving government grants to faith-based and other
   private charitable organizations to supplant welfare spending. Members
   of the GOP also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be
   in place to ensure the safety net is not abused. Republicans introduced
   and strongly supported the welfare reform of 1996, which was signed
   into law by Democratic President Clinton, and which limited eligibility
   for welfare, successfully leading to many former welfare recipients
   finding jobs.^[35]^[36]

   The party opposes a government-run single-payer health care system,
   believing such a system constitutes socialized medicine, and is in
   favor of a personal or employer-based system of insurance, supplemented
   by Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid, which covers approximately
   40% of the poor.^[citation needed]^[dead link]^[37] The GOP has a mixed
   record of supporting the historically popular Social Security, Medicare
   and Medicaid programs. Congressional Republicans and the Bush
   administration supported a reduction in Medicaid's growth rate;^[38]
   however, congressional Republicans expanded Medicare, supporting a new
   drug plan for seniors starting in 2006.

   In 2011, House Republicans overwhelmingly voted for a proposal named
   The Path to Prosperity and for major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and
   the 2010 Health Care Legislation. Many Republicans support increased
   health insurance portability, laws promoting coverage of pre-existing
   medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation
   of a streamlined electronic medical records system, an emphasis on
   preventative care rather than emergency room care, and tax benefits
   aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and
   targeted to promote universal access. They generally oppose government
   funding for elective abortions.^[39]

   Republicans are generally opposed by labor union management and
   members, and have supported various legislation on the state and
   federal levels, including right to work legislation and the
   Taft-Hartley Act, which gives workers the right not to participate in
   unions, as opposed to a closed shop, which prohibits workers from
   choosing not to join unions in workplaces. Some Republicans are opposed
   to increases in the minimum wage, believing that such increases hurt
   many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services, export jobs
   overseas, and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease
   in profit.

Separation of powers and balance of powers

   Many contemporary Republicans voice support of strict constructionism,
   the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted
   narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather
   than a more flexible "living Constitution" model.^[40] Most Republicans
   point to Roe v. Wade as a case of judicial activism, where the court
   overturned most laws restricting abortion on the basis of a right to
   privacy inferred from the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment
   to the United States Constitution. Some Republicans have actively
   sought to block judges whom they see as being activist judges and have
   sought the appointment of judges who claim to practice judicial
   restraint. The issue of judicial deference to the legislature is a
   matter of some debate—like the Democrats, most Republicans criticize
   court decisions that overturn their own (conservative) legislation as
   overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing
   legislation. Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take
   a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more
   firmly.^[41]

   The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade
   to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain
   types of cases, in an attempt to limit judicial review. These
   jurisdiction stripping laws have included removing federal review of
   the recognition of same-sex marriage with the Marriage Protection
   Act,^[42] the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the
   Pledge Protection Act, and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in
   the Detainee Treatment Act. The Supreme Court overruled the last of
   these limitations in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.

   Compared to Democrats, many Republicans believe in a more robust
   version of federalism with greater limitations placed upon federal
   authorities and a larger role reserved for those of the individual
   States. Following this view on federalism, Republicans often take a
   less expansive reading of congressional power under the Commerce
   Clause, such as in the opinion of William Rehnquist in United States v.
   Lopez. Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more
   dramatic narrowing of Commerce Clause power by revisiting, among other
   cases, Wickard v. Filburn, a case that held that growing wheat on a
   farm for consumption on the same farm fell under congressional power to
   "regulate commerce ... among the several States".

   President George W. Bush was a proponent of the unitary executive
   theory and cited it within his Signing statements about legislation
   passed by Congress.^[43] The administration's interpretation of the
   unitary executive theory was called seriously into question by Hamdan
   v. Rumsfeld, where the Supreme Court ruled 5–3 that the President does
   not have sweeping powers to override or ignore laws through his power
   as commander in chief,^[44] stating "the Executive is bound to comply
   with the Rule of Law that prevails".^[45] Following the ruling, the
   Bush administration has sought Congressional authorization for programs
   started only on executive mandate, as was the case with the Military
   Commissions Act, or abandoned programs it had previously asserted
   executive authority to enact, in the case of the National Security
   Agency domestic wiretapping program.

Environmental policies

   Main article: Environmental policy of the United States

   Historically, some leaders in the Republican party supported the
   protection of the environment. For example, Republican President
   Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies
   eventually led to the creation of the modern National Park
   Service.^[46] Republican President Richard Nixon was responsible for
   establishing the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.^[47]

   In 2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican Governor of
   California, signed into law a set of carbon emission regulations that
   were the country's first cap on greenhouse gases, and included vehicle
   emissions standards higher than those of the Federal
   Government.^[48]^[49] These regulations were opposed by the George W.
   Bush administration.^[48] More recently, California Republican Governor
   Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the support of 16 other states, sued the
   Federal Government and the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency for the right to set vehicle emission standards higher than the
   Federal Standard,^[48] a right to which California is entitled under
   the Clean Air Act. As a result, Schwarzenegger, with the support of 16
   other states, sued the federal government and the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency for the right to set vehicle emission
   standards higher than the Federal Standard.^[48]^[50]

   President George W. Bush publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto
   Protocols on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western
   industrialized nations such as the United States while favoring
   developing Global South polluters such as China and India.^[51]

   In 2000, the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support
   for the development of market-based solutions to environmental
   problems. According to the platform, "economic prosperity and
   environmental protection must advance together, environmental
   regulations should be based on science, the government’s role should be
   to provide market-based incentives to develop the technologies to meet
   environmental standards, we should ensure that environmental policy
   meets the needs of localities, and environmental policy should focus on
   achieving results processes."^[52]

   The Bush administration,^[53] along with several of the candidates that
   sought the Republican Presidential nomination in 2008,^[54]^[55]^[56]
   supported increased Federal investment into the development of clean
   alternative fuels, increased nuclear power, as well as fuels such as
   ethanol, as a way of helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, as
   opposed to supporting less use of carbon dioxide-producing methods of
   generating energy. The Republican party rejects cap-and-trade
   policy.^[57] Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in
   protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge[4], a
   position that has drawn sharp criticism from some activists.
   Republicans are deeply divided over the human causes of climate change
   and global warming [5].

   Green conservatism manifested itself as a movement in groups such as
   ConservAmerica, which seeks to strengthen the Republican Party's stance
   on environmental issues and support efforts to conserve natural
   resources and protect human and environmental health.

Social policies

   The Republican Party is generally associated with social conservatism,
   although it does have centrist and libertarian factions.

Abortion and embryonic stem cell research

   A majority of the GOP's national and state candidates are pro-life and
   oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds. However many
   hold exceptions in the case of incest, rape or the mother's life being
   at risk. When Congress voted on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in
   2003, Congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to support the
   ban.

   Although the GOP has voted for increases in government funding of
   scientific research, some members actively oppose the federal funding
   of embryonic stem cell research beyond the original lines because it
   involves the destruction of human embryos, while arguing for applying
   research money into adult stem cell or amniotic stem cell research.
   However, human embryo's are not and have not been destroyed simply for
   the purpose of collecting stem cells; the embryos from which stem cells
   are obtained are already slated for destruction, resulting from extra
   embryos created for In-vitro-ferilization.^[58]^[59]^[60] The stem cell
   issue has garnered two once-rare vetoes on research funding bills from
   President Bush, who said the research "crossed a moral boundary".

   In August 2012, the party approved a platform advocating banning
   abortions, without exceptions for the cases of rape or incest. The text
   specifically stated that "the unborn child has a fundamental individual
   right to life which cannot be infringed." It also opposed using public
   revenues to promote abortions, to perform them, or to fund
   organizations that do either such things.^[61]

Civil rights

   Republicans are generally against affirmative action for women and some
   minorities, often describing it as a quota system, believing that it is
   not meritocratic and that it is counter-productive socially by only
   further promoting discrimination. Many Republicans support race-neutral
   admissions policies in universities, but support taking into account
   the socioeconomic status of the student.^[62]^[63]

Second Amendment rights

   Republicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws
   regulating guns, although some Republicans favor limited restrictions
   in some urban areas on the grounds of public safety.

The War on Drugs

   Republicans generally support the War on Drugs, and oppose the
   legalization of drugs, believing that smoking and drugs are immoral and
   wrong, and the country should do its best to protect people from
   illegal drugs, and support Just Say No.^[citation needed]

Education

   Most Republicans support school choice through charter schools and
   school vouchers for private schools; many have denounced the
   performance of the public school system and the teachers' unions. The
   party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public
   schools, most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind
   Act of 2001. Many Republicans, however, opposed the creation of the
   United States Department of Education when it was initially created in
   1979.^[citation needed]

LGBT issues

   Groups advocating for LGBT issues inside the party include the Log
   Cabin Republicans, Young Conservatives For The Freedom To Marry, and
   College Republican National Committee.

   A November/December 2013 Public Religion Research Institute poll
   sponsored by the Ford Foundation found that Republicans are divided in
   their perceptions of their own party: 45% think the GOP is friendly
   toward LGBT people, while 41% think the party is unfriendly.^[64]

   The 1992 presidential platform was the first to oppose same-sex
   marriage.^[65]

   A May 2012 poll found that only 37% of Republicans supported a
   constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a
   women.^[67] A November/December 2013 poll found that 63% of Republicans
   believe same-sex marriage should be left up to individual states to
   decide.^[64]

Military service

   The 1992 Republican Party platform adopted support for continuing to
   exclude homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and
   discipline.^[65] The support for the exclusion of homosexuals from
   military service would remain in the Republican Party platform until
   the 2012 Republican Party platform, which removed that language from
   it.^[68]

   A May 2012 United Technologies/National Journal Congressional
   Connection Poll found that only 41% of Republicans supported restoring
   the prohibition against gays serving openly in the military.^[67]

   Anti-discrimination laws

   The 1992 Republican Party platform adopted opposition to including
   sexual preference into anti-discrimination statutes.^[65] The 2000
   Republican Party platform included the statement: "We support the First
   Amendment right of freedom of association and stand united with private
   organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America, and support their
   positions."^[69] The 2004 Republican Party platform removed both parts
   of that language from the platform and stated that the party supports
   anti-discrimination legislation.^[70] The 2008 and 2012 Republican
   Party platform supported anti-discrimination statues on based on sex,
   race, age, religion, creed, disability, or national origin, but both
   platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender
   identity.^[68]^[71]

   A November/December 2013 Public Religion Research Institute poll
   sponsored by the Ford Foundation found that 61% of Republicans support
   laws protecting gay and lesbian people against employment
   discrimination, with only 33% opposing such laws.^[64] A 2007 Gallup
   poll showed 60% of Republicans supported expanding federal hate crime
   laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity, with only 30%
   opposing such laws.^[72]

Foreign aid

   The 2012 Republican Party platform opposes the Obama administration
   from attempting to impose its "cultural agenda", including a
   "homosexual rights agenda" in other countries by restricting foreign
   aid.^[68]

National defense and military spending

   Although the Republican Party has always advocated a strong national
   defense, historically they disapproved of interventionist foreign
   policy actions. Republicans opposed Woodrow Wilson's intervention in
   World War I and his subsequent attempt to create the League of Nations.
   They were also staunchly opposed to intervention in World War II until
   the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. However, recent trends have seen
   more influence from the interventionist neoconservative ideology,^[73]
   which advocates for the "assertive" promotion of democracy and
   promotion of "American national interest" in international affairs
   (including by means of military force).^[74]^[75]

Dwight Eisenhower

   In 1952 Dwight D. Eisenhower was drafted by the Republican Party to
   counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert Taft.
   Eisenhower's campaign was a crusade against the Truman administration's
   policies regarding "Korea, Communism and Corruption."^[76]

Ronald Reagan

Grenada

   U.S. Army Rangers conduct an airborne assault in Saint George Parish,
   Grenada during the hostilities.

   On October 25, 1983, at the request of the regional governments, Reagan
   ordered Operation Urgent Fury, a military invasion of the small,
   Caribbean island of Grenada, where over a thousand American students
   and their families were in residence. A Marxist coup d'état had
   overthrown the established government and shot its leader Maurice
   Bishop. This was the first actual rollback that destroyed a Communist
   regime and marked the continued escalation of tensions with the Soviet
   Union known as the Second Cold War. Democrats had been highly critical
   of Reagan's anti-Communism in Latin America, but this time Reagan had
   strong support from the voters and leading Democrats said the invasion
   was justified.^[77] It built the President's image of decisive strong
   action a year before the 1984 election, when Mondale said he too would
   have ordered the invasion. Indeed Mondale attacked Senator Gary Hart,
   his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, as isolationist and
   weak on fighting dictatorships.^[78]

Cold War

   President Reagan escalated the Cold War by accelerating a reversal from
   the policy of détente, which began in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter
   following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.^[79] Reagan then ordered
   a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces.^[80]

Covert operations

   Under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine, Reagan and
   his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist
   resistance movements in an effort to "rollback" Soviet-backed communist
   governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The policy was
   politically controversial, with liberal Democrats especially angry with
   Reagan's operations in Latin America.^[78] Covert operations elsewhere,
   especially in Afghanistan against the Soviets, however, usually won
   bipartisan support.^[81]

George H. W. Bush

Gulf War 1990–91

   Main article: Gulf War

   On August 1, 1990, Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait.
   President Bush formed an international coalition and secured UN
   approval to expel Iraq. On January 12, 1991, Congress voted approval
   for a military attack, Operation Desert Storm, by a narrow margin, with
   Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The vote in the House was
   250–183, and in the Senate 52–47. In the Senate 42 Republicans and 10
   Democrats voted yes to war, while 45 Democrats and two Republicans
   voted no. In the House 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted yes, and
   179 Democrats, three Republicans and one Independent voted no.^[82] The
   war was short and successful, but Hussein was allowed to remain in
   power. Arab countries repaid all the American military costs.^[83]

1990s opposition politics

   In the 1990s, Republicans in Congress split over U.S. military
   intervention in the Yugoslav wars under Democratic President Bill
   Clinton. Examples of interventionist-minded Republicans are then Senate
   Majority Leader Bob Dole and Senator John McCain and examples of
   opposing figures are later Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House
   Majority Leader Dick Armey, the latter of which who called Kosovo
   deployment "poorly considered and unlikely to achieve our desired
   ends."^[84] In 2000, successful Republican Presidential candidate
   George W. Bush ran on a platform that generally opposed U.S.
   involvement in foreign conflicts, saying that the U.S. didn't have the
   responsibly of "nation building". As such, he advocated U.S. military
   withdrawal from the Balkan NATO peacekeeping mission.^[85]

George W. Bush

Invasion of Afghanistan

   After the September 11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Bush launched the
   War on Terrorism, in which the United States led an international
   coalition invaded Afghanistan, the base of terrorist Osama bin Laden.
   This invasion led to the toppling of the Taliban regime. After a
   surprise raid on bin Laden's compound on May 2, 2011, ordered by Barack
   Obama, bin Laden was killed and his body disposed of in the sea. There
   was bipartisan support for this action, with notable Republican and
   Democratic figures speaking out in support of the raid.

Invasion of Iraq

   President George W. Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and
   Senate, announces the Iraq war resolution on October 2, 2002.

   In 2003, following the bipartisan Iraq war resolution and the perceived
   issues regarding UN weapons inspectors, President Bush launched the
   invasion of Iraq, in conjunction with coalition partners, most notably,
   the United Kingdom. The invasion was described by Bush as being part of
   the general 'War on Terrorism'. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was
   captured and executed, but his supporters and other opposing forces
   staged an insurgency that dragged on for years. It was a major election
   issue in 2004 (when Bush was reelected) and in 2006 and 2008 (when
   President Obama was first elected to the Presidency, and Democrats
   increased their numbers in both Houses of Congress).^[86]^[87]

   Significant public support for the war effort existed in the early days
   among both parties and others, but opinions changed course soon with
   about half of Americans surveyed in November 2003 judging the end
   result as not worth it. The lack of expected stockpiles of weapons of
   mass destruction and the failures of the military occupation of Iraq
   altered voters' views.^[87] Polling done by CBS News on the ten-year
   anniversary of the U.S. invasion found that Republicans, by a margin of
   61%, believed that the military action was the right thing to do, with
   majorities of Democrats and independents disagreeing. However, that
   same poll found that Republicans were divided on 46% to 45% lines on
   the question of if U.S. forces succeeded in their overall
   objectives.^[88] By January 2014, 52% of Republicans were supportive of
   military action in Iraq, with 38% saying the war had succeeded, showing
   that support for the war among Republicans has declined over time.^[89]

2010s opposition politics

   President Barack Obama, inaugurated in January 2009 and later reelected
   to a second term, continued the previous policy of keeping large-scale
   intervention in the War in Afghanistan, with a plan of removing combat
   troops while Afghan forces trained to replace them until late 2014. An
   October 2012 Pew Research Center poll found Republicans evenly divided
   at 48% over the choices of keeping American military forces in
   Afghanistan "until the situation has stabilized" analogous to Obama's
   policies versus making them leave "as soon as possible". An article in
   the news-magazine Foreign Policy stated that this represented a move
   from a previous "hawkish" stance by Republicans.^[90]

The Arab Spring

   The Republican Party has been largely split on the attitude the United
   States should take in response to the events of the Arab Spring.
   Republican leadership in the House and Senate supported the 2011
   military intervention in Libya, though many conservative congressional
   Republicans, such as Michele Bachmann, voted in opposition to the
   intervention.^[91] Similarly, many senior Republicans, including
   presidential nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney as well as the Tea
   Party-affiliated Florida Senator Marco Rubio supported arming the
   Syrian rebels,^[92]^[93]^[94] while conservative Republicans in
   Congress proclaimed their opposition to this.^[95]^[96] Congressional
   Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were
   overwhelmingly opposed to the proposed US military intervention in
   Syria.^[97] In both Libya and Syria, Republicans opposed to
   intervention have cited Islamist influence within the rebel
   groups^[98]^[99] and a lack of U.S. national security interest^[100] as
   the reason for their opposition.

Ukraine

   Leading Republicans all supported sanctions against Russia in response
   to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. No major
   politician of either party opposed the first rounds of American and EU
   sanctions in April 2014.^[101]

Policies

   As a result, some in the Republican Party support unilateralism on
   issues of national security, believing in the ability and right of the
   United States to act without external support in matters of its
   national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and
   international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of
   neorealism and realism, characterizing conflicts between nations as
   struggles between faceless forces of international structure, as
   opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual
   leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's Evil Empire
   stance on the Soviet Union and George W. Bush's Axis of evil.

   Republicans secured gains in the 2002 and 2004 elections, with the War
   on Terror being one of the top issues favoring them. Since the
   September 11, 2001 attacks, some in the party support neoconservative
   policies with regard to the War on Terror, including the 2001 war in
   Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

   The doctrine of preemptive war, wars to disarm and destroy potential
   military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in
   defense against actual attack, has been advocated by prominent members
   of the Bush administration, but the war within Iraq has undercut the
   influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party. Rudy Giuliani,
   mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks,
   and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, has
   stated his support for that policy, saying America must keep itself "on
   the offensive" against terrorists.

   The George W. Bush administration took the position that the Geneva
   Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants, saying they apply to
   soldiers serving in the armies of nation states and not terrorist
   organizations such as Al-Qaeda. The Supreme Court overruled this
   position in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which held that the Geneva Conventions
   were legally binding and must be followed in regards to all enemy
   combatants. Prominent Republicans such as John McCain, Mike Huckabee,
   and Ron Paul strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation
   techniques, which they view as torture.

Other international policies

Israel

   The Republican leadership supports a strong Israel, but supports
   efforts to secure peace in the Middle East between Israel and its Arab
   neighbors.^[102]

Russia

   The Republican Party claims the U.S. should promote friendship not only
   between the United States and Russia, but also between Russia and its
   neighbors. With Russia, the U.S. needs patience, consistency, and a
   principled reliance on democratic forces. Russia must stop encouraging
   the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.^[103] The party
   stress the common interests of the two countries which includes ending
   terrorism, combating nuclear proliferation, promoting bilateral
   trade.^[104]

Trade

   The party, through former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, has advocated
   reforms in the United Nations to halt corruption such as that which
   afflicted the Oil-for-Food Program. Most Republicans oppose the Kyoto
   Protocol. The party promotes free trade agreements, most notably North
   American Free Trade Agreement, Dominican Republic–Central America Free
   Trade Agreement and an effort to go further south to Brazil, Peru and
   Colombia, although some have a protectionist view of trade.

Immigration

   See also: Immigration to the United States and Illegal immigration to
   the United States

   Republicans are divided on how to confront illegal immigration between
   a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship
   guidelines, and border enforcement-first approach. In general,
   pro-growth advocates within the Republican Party support more
   immigration, and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it. In
   2006, the White House supported and Republican-led Senate passed
   comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually allow millions
   of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House, also led by
   Republicans, took an enforcement-first approach, and the bill failed to
   pass the conference committee.^[105]

   Lately, after the defeat in the 2012 presidential elections, and
   considering the low percent of Latinos that voted Republican, several
   Republicans are advocating a friendlier approach to immigrants. Former
   US Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez is promoting the creation of
   a SuperPAC for immigration reform.^[106]

   Proposals calling for systematic reform of the U.S. immigration system
   such that residents that have come into the U.S. illegally have a
   pathway to legal citizenship have attracted broad Republican support in
   some polls. For example, the Public Religion Research Institute found
   in late 2013 that 60% of Republicans supported the pathway concept,
   compared to 63% of Americans as a whole.^[107]

Voter base

   In general terms, the number of Americans self-identifying as
   Republicans has been around 30% over the past twenty years. According
   to Gallup polling, 29% of Americans identified as Republicans versus
   31% doing so as Democrats and 38% as independents in 2010, which
   represented a slight drop from the 31% identified as Republicans in
   1988.^[108] In a 2014 Gallup survey, Republican identification was down
   to 25 percent, the lowest in at least 25 years.^[109]^[110]

   Historically speaking, the Republican base initially consisted of
   northern white Protestants and African-Americans nationwide, with the
   first Presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, receiving almost no
   votes in the South. This trend continued into the 20th century, with
   1944 Republican presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey having only 10%
   of his popular votes in the South. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
   the core base shifted considerably. The party's base consists of groups
   such as white, married Protestants, rural and suburban citizens, and
   non-union workers without college degrees, with urban residents, ethnic
   minorities, the unmarried, and union workers having shifted to the
   Democratic Party.^[111]

Business community

   The GOP is usually seen as the traditionally pro-business party and it
   garners major support from a wide variety of industries from the
   financial sector to small businesses. Republicans are about 50 percent
   more likely to be self-employed, and are more likely to work in
   management.^[112]

   A survey cited by the Washington Post in 2012 stated that 61 percent of
   small business owners planned to vote for then-Republican Presidential
   Candidate Mitt Romney. Small business became a major theme of the 2012
   Republican National Convention. For example, South Dakota Senator John
   Thune discussed his grandfather’s hardware store and New Hampshire
   Senator Kelly Ayotte referred to her husband’s landscaping
   company.^[113]

Demographics

   The Democrats do better among younger Americans and Republicans among
   older Americans. In 2006, the GOP won 38% of the voters aged
   18–29.^[114]

   Low-income voters tend to favor the Democrats while high-income voters
   tend to support the Republicans. In 2012, Obama won 60% of voters with
   income under $50,000, and 45% of those with incomes higher than
   that.^[115] Bush won 41% of the poorest 20% of voters in 2004, 55% of
   the richest twenty percent, and 53% of those in between. In the 2006
   House races, the voters with incomes over $50,000 were 49% Republican,
   while those under were 38%.^[114]

   Republicans hold a large majority in the armed services, with 57% of
   active military personnel and 66% of officers identified as Republican
   in 2003.^[116]

Gender

   Since 1980, a "gender gap" has seen slightly stronger support for the
   GOP among men than among women. In 2012, Obama won 55% of the women and
   45% of the men—and more women voted than men.^[115] In the 2006 House
   races, 43% of women voted for GOP, while 47% of men did so.^[114] In
   the 2010 midterms, the "gender gap" was reduced with women supporting
   GOP and Democratic candidates equally 49% to 49%.^[117]^[118] In recent
   elections, Republicans have found their greatest support among whites
   from married couples with children living at home.^[119] Unmarried and
   divorced women were far more likely to vote for Kerry in 2004.^[120]
   2012 returns reveal a continued weakness among unmarried women, a large
   and growing portion of the electorate.^[121]

   Although Mitt Romney lost women as a whole 44-55 to Barack Obama, he
   won married women 53-46.^[122] Obama won unmarried women 67-31,^[123]
   suggesting that women are not a unified voting bloc and that the divide
   may be between financially stable, older married women and younger,
   more socially liberal women rather than between women and men.

Education

   In 2012, the Pew Research Center conducted a study of registered voters
   with a 35–28, Democrat-to-Republican gap. They found that
   self-described Democrats had a +8 advantage over Republicans among
   college graduates, +14 of all post-graduates polled. Republicans were
   +11 among white men with college degrees, Democrats +10 among women
   with degrees. Democrats accounted for 36% of all respondents with an
   education of high school or less, Republicans were 28%. When isolating
   just white registered voters polled, Republicans had a +6 advantage
   overall and were +9 of those with a high school education or
   less.^[124]

   An analysis of 2008 through 2012 survey data from the General Social
   Survey, the National Election Studies, and the Pew Research Center for
   the People and the Press led to the following assessment of the overall
   educational status of self-identified Democrats and Republicans:

     On average, self-identified Republicans have more years of education
     (4 to 8 months each, depending on the survey) and are probably more
     likely to hold, at the least, a 4-year college degree. (One major
     survey indicates that they are more likely, while the results of
     another survey are statistically insignificant.) It also appears
     that Republicans continue to out-test Democrats in surveys that
     assess political knowledge and/or current events. With respect to
     post-graduate studies, the educational advantage is shifting towards
     self-identified Democrats. They are now more likely to hold
     post-graduate college degrees. (One major survey indicates that they
     are more likely, while the results of another survey are
     statistically insignificant.)^[125]

Ethnicity

   A majority of the Republican voter base is White American. While
   historically the party had been supporters of rights for African
   Americans since the 1860s, it lost its leadership position; the GOP has
   been winning under 15% of the black vote in recent national elections
   (1980 to 2008). The party has recently nominated African American
   candidates for senator or governor in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
   Maryland, though none were successful. In the 2010 elections, two
   African American Republicans were elected to the U.S. House of
   Representatives.^[126] The Republican Party abolished slavery under
   Abraham Lincoln, defeated the Slave Power, and gave blacks the vote
   during Reconstruction in the late 1860s. Until the New Deal of the
   1930s, blacks supported the GOP by large margins.^[127] Most black
   voters switched to the Democratic Party in the 1930s when the New Deal
   offered them employment opportunities, and major figures, such as
   Eleanor Roosevelt, began to support civil rights. They became one of
   the core components of the New Deal Coalition. In the South, blacks
   were able to vote in large numbers after 1965, when a bipartisan
   coalition passed the Voting Rights Act, and ever since have formed a
   significant portion (20–50%) of the Democratic vote in that
   region.^[128]

   In recent decades, the party has been moderately successful in gaining
   support from Hispanic and Asian American voters. George W. Bush, who
   campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes, received 35% of their vote
   in 2000 and 44% in 2004.^[129] The party's strong anti-communist stance
   has made it popular among some minority groups from current and former
   Communist states, in particular Cuban Americans, Korean Americans,
   Chinese Americans, and Vietnamese Americans. The election of Bobby
   Jindal as Governor of Louisiana has been hailed as pathbreaking.^[130]
   He is the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first
   state governor of Indian descent.^[131] In the 2008 presidential
   election, John McCain won 55% of white votes, 35% of Asian votes, 31%
   of Hispanic votes, and 4% of African American votes.^[132] In the 2010
   House election, the GOP won 60% of the white votes, 38% of Hispanic
   votes, and 9% of the African American vote.^[133] According to John
   Avlon in 2013, the Republican party is more diverse at the statewide
   elected official level than the Democratic Party, including Nevada
   Governor Brian Sandoval and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.^[134]

   For decades, a greater percentage of white voters identified themselves
   as Democrats, rather than Republicans. However, since the mid-1990s
   whites have been more likely to self-identify as Republicans than
   Democrats.^[135]

Religious belief

   Religion has always played a major role for both parties but, in the
   course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed.
   Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960,
   with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic, and
   Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old
   differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 80s that
   undercut the New Deal coalition.^[136] Voters who attend church weekly
   gave 61% of their votes to Bush in 2004; those who attend occasionally
   gave him only 47%, while those who never attend gave him 36%.
   Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of
   Catholics (even though John Kerry was Catholic). Since 1980, large
   majorities of evangelicals have voted Republican; 70–80% voted for Bush
   in 2000 and 2004, and 70% for GOP House candidates in 2006. Jews
   continue to vote 70–80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the
   African American churches, especially the National Baptists, while
   their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54–46 in
   the 2010 midterms.^[132] The main line traditional Protestants
   (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Disciples) have
   dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968). The
   mainline denominations are rapidly shrinking in size. Mormons in Utah
   and neighboring states voted 75% or more for Bush in 2000.^[137]
   This map shows the vote in the 2004 presidential election by county.
   All major Republican geographic constituencies are visible: red
   dominates the map, showing Republican strength in the rural areas,
   while the denser areas (i.e., cities) are blue. Notable exceptions
   include the Pacific coast, New England, the Black Belt, areas with high
   Native American populations, and the heavily Hispanic parts of the
   Southwest.

Location

   Since 1980, geographically the Republican "base" ("red states") is
   strongest in the South, the Midwest, and Mountain West. While it is
   weakest on the West Coast and Northeast, this has not always been the
   case; historically the northeast was a bastion of the Republican Party
   with Vermont and Maine being the only two states to vote against
   Franklin Roosevelt all four times. The Midwest has been roughly
   balanced since 1854, with Illinois becoming more Democratic and liberal
   because of the city of Chicago (see below) and Minnesota and Wisconsin
   more Republican since 1990. Ohio and Indiana both trend Republican.
   Since the 1930s, the Democrats have dominated most central cities,
   while the Republicans now dominate rural areas and the majority of
   suburbs.^[138]

   The South has become solidly Republican in national elections since
   1980, and has been trending Republican at the state level since then at
   a slower pace.^[139] In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%–30% among Southern
   whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70–30
   lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third
   of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted
   for Bush by 80–20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.^[114]^[129]

   The Republican Party's strongest focus of political influence lies in
   the Great Plains states, particularly Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South
   Dakota, and North Dakota, and in the Mountain states of Idaho, Wyoming,
   and Utah (Utah gave George W. Bush more than 70% of the popular vote in
   2004). These states are sparsely populated with few major urban
   centers, and have majority white populations, making it extremely
   difficult for Democrats to create a sustainable voter base there. While
   still remaining notably Republican, Montana is the only state in the
   region with a more moderate lean.^[140] Unlike the South, these areas
   have been strongly Republican since before the party realignments of
   the 1960s. The Great Plains states were one of the few areas of the
   country where Republicans had any significant support during the Great
   Depression.

Conservatives, moderates, liberals, and progressives

   Republican conservatives are strongest in the South, Mountain West and
   Midwest, where they draw support from social conservatives. The
   moderates tend to dominate the party in New England, and used to be
   well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such
   leaders as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford, they
   usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s,
   they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the
   cabinets of Republican presidents. In Vermont, Jim Jeffords, a
   Republican Senator became an independent in 2001 due to growing
   disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership. In addition,
   moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several
   New England States, while Lincoln Chafee, a former moderate Republican
   senator is the independent governor of Rhode Island. Senators Olympia
   Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, and Senator Scott Brown of
   Massachusetts are notable moderate Republicans from New England. From
   1991 to 2007, moderate Republicans served as governors of
   Massachusetts. Prominent Republican moderates have included Presidents
   Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon and George Bush Sr., as well as
   Senate leaders Howard Baker and Bob Dole, and New York Mayors Rudy
   Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.

   Some well-known conservative radio hosts, including national figures
   such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Neal Boortz, Laura
   Ingraham, Michael Reagan, Howie Carr, and Michael Savage, as well as
   many local commentators, support Republican causes, while vocally
   opposing those of the Democrats.^[141]

   Historically, the Republican Party has included a liberal wing made up
   of individuals who, like members of the liberal wing of the Democratic
   Party, believe in the power of government to improve people's lives.
   Before 1932 leading progressive Republicans included Theodore
   Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., Charles Evan Hughes, Hiram
   Johnson, William Borah, George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Fiorello
   La Guardia.^[142] Prominent liberal Republicans, 1936 to the 1970s,
   included Alf Landon, Wendell Willkie, Earl Warren, Thomas Dewey,
   Prescott Bush, Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., George W.
   Romney, William Scranton, and Jacob Javits. Since 1976, liberalism has
   virtually faded out of the GOP, apart from a few Northeastern
   holdouts.^[20]

Republican factions: populist vs establishment

   Nationwide polls of Republican voters in 2014 by the Pew Center
   identified a growing split in the GOP coalition, between "business
   conservatives" or "establishment conservatives" and "steadfast
   conservatives" or "populist conservatives".^[143] Each group is over
   84% Republican, and together they comprise 70% of the Republicans who
   played who pay close attention to politics and typically vote in most
   elections. Both factions are solidly inside the conservative coalition,
   and they agree on most issues. However they sharply disagree on
   economic issues of concern to business. 71% of the populist faction
   believe that too much power is concentrated in the hands of large
   companies, compared to only 35% among the establishment faction. Asked
   whether Wall Street helps the economy, 74% of the establishment faction
   agreed compared to 49% of the populist faction . The factions differ
   sharply on whether the US should be more or less active in world
   affairs. On foreign trade, 68% of the establishment faction believes
   that free trade agreements benefit the American economy, compared to
   only 39% of the populist faction. In the immigration debate, the
   establishment faction favors a path to citizenship, and 64% says that
   immigrants strengthen the nation, compared to only 17% of the
   populists. The tension exploded into front-page news and June 2014,
   when an establishment leader, house Majority Leader Eric Cantor was
   upset by a little-known populist conservative in the Republican primary
   in Virginia. The establishment Republicans fought back in the
   Mississippi primary in June, as incumbent U.S. Senator Thad Cochran
   narrowly defeated populist state senator Chris McDaniel in a bitter
   fight that featured heavy spending by national organizations.

   The Tea Party movement is most often aligned with the Republican Party.

   In Congress, Cantor's replacement as Majority Leader is Congressman
   Kevin McCarthy, who had been an advocate of the Export-Import Bank. It
   finances overseas purchases of American products, especially airplanes.
   However after meeting with populist Congressmen, McCarthy changed
   positions and decided to support the termination of the
   Bank.^[144]^[145]

Trends

   As of 2004^[update], the Republican Party had remained fairly cohesive,
   as both strong economic libertarians and social conservatives opposed
   the Democrats, whom they saw as the party of bloated and more secular,
   liberal government.^[146] Yet, some libertarians have argued that the
   GOP's policies have grown increasingly restrictive of personal
   liberties, and has contributed to increasing corporate welfare and
   national debt.^[147] Some social conservatives have expressed
   dissatisfaction with the party's support for economic policies that
   they see as sometimes in conflict with their moral values.^[148]

   In January 2013, the Republican Party's favorability ratings reached an
   all-time low of 33% as measured by Pew Research Center, and only 25%
   approved of the GOP leadership.^[149] In February 2013, a follow-up
   poll showed that 62% of Americans polled and 65% percent of independent
   voters viewed Republicans as "out of touch with the American
   people."^[150]

   In March 2013, National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gave a
   stinging report on the GOP’s failures in 2012, calling on the party to
   reinvent itself and officially endorse immigration reform. He said,
   "There’s no one reason we lost. Our message was weak; our ground game
   was insufficient; we weren’t inclusive; we were behind in both data and
   digital; and our primary and debate process needed improvement." He
   proposed 219 reforms that including a $10 million marketing campaign to
   reach women, minorities and gays; a shorter, more controlled primary
   season; and better data collection and research facilities.^[151]

   With a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents
   under the age of 49 supporting legal recognition of same-sex marriages
   versus the opposition from those over 50, the issue remains a
   particular divide within the Party. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
   has remarked that the "Party is going to be torn on this issue" with
   some constituents "going to flake off."^[152]^[153]

   It has been reported recently (as of late 2011, early 2012) that the
   Republican Party has veered far more towards the 'right' or
   conservative side of the political spectrum in the most recent election
   cycle. As the republican party veers more conservative, an independent
   study group examining the economic situation of the United States,
   known as 'Simpson-Bowles,' (of which the two main members are a high
   powered democrat and republican, specifically a former Chief of Staff
   of President Clinton and Republican whip for 20 some years) has
   determined that the position put forth by President Obama in the 2011
   debt crisis is the best overall path for the United States to travel,
   economically.^[154]^[155]^[156]^[157]^[158]^[159]

   The Republican party's candidate for President in 2012, Mitt Romney,
   lost to President Barack Obama, the fifth time in six elections the
   Republican candidate received fewer votes than his democratic
   counterpart has inspired some republicans to speak out against their
   own party; former Senator Bob Dole said, "today's GOP members are too
   conservative and overly partisan. They ought to put a sign on the
   National Committee doors that says closed for repairs,"^[160] where
   former Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine has said she is in agreement with
   Bob Dole.^[161] Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Colin Powell said
   the GOP has "a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party,". .
   ."The whole birther movement: Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate
   this kind of discussion within the party?" Powell asked. "I think the
   party has to take a look at itself."^[162] The CRNC released a report
   in June 2013 that was highly critical of the party.^[163]
