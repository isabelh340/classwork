Civil liberties in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   Liberties of the United States are certain inalienable rights retained
   by (as opposed to privileges granted to) citizens of the United States
   under the Constitution of the United States, as interpreted and
   clarified by the Supreme Court of the United States and lower federal
   courts.^[1] Civil liberties are simply defined as individual legal and
   constitutional protections from entities more powerful than an
   individual, for example, parts of the government, other individuals, or
   corporations. The liberties explicitly defined, make up the Bill of
   Rights, including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the
   right to privacy.^[2] There are also many liberties of people not
   defined in the Constitution, as stated in the Ninth Amendment: The
   enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
   construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Freedom of speech[edit]

   Main article: Freedom of speech in the United States

   Freedom of speech is a civil liberty protected under the First
   Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted on December 15,
   1791.

          Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
          religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
          the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the
          people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for
          a redress of grievances.^[3]

   This civil liberty grants all United States citizens the right to
   express themselves and enjoy the expression of others without
   interference of the government. This freedom of expression is often
   tested and can be the center of controversy because of how it is
   interpreted. The courts have recognized the Bill of Rights as having
   the intention of rights of privacy and the separation of church and
   state, even though it is not clearly stated. It is also thought that
   the amendment refers only to government interference, which leads to
   individual corporations and businesses violating these freedoms.

   The following types of speech are not protected constitutionally:
   defamation or false statements, child pornography, obscenity, damaging
   the national security interests, verbal acts, and fighting words.
   Because these categories fall outside of the First Amendment
   privileges, the courts can legally restrict or criminalize any
   expressive act within them. Other expressions, including threat of
   bodily harm or publicizing illegal activity, may also be ruled
   illegal.^[4]

Right to bear arms[edit]

   The right of the people to keep and bear arms is assured by the Second
   Amendment to the United States Constitution:

          A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
          free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall
          not be infringed.

   This amendment was legally controversial until a Supreme Court case in
   2008. In the District of Columbia v. Heller case, the Second Amendment
   and its relation to gun control laws in the District of Columbia were
   evaluated by the Supreme Court for the first time in 70 years. The
   court decided that the Second Amendment did not grant the right to keep
   and bear arms solely to a military force, but to private citizens as
   well. The Court held that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an
   individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a
   militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as
   self-defense within the home" -District of Columbia v. Heller, 128
   S.Ct. 2783 (2008).^[5]^[6]

   Statute laws regarding the keeping and bearing of arms vary by state.
   Different states have made provisions to this right throughout history,
   generally regarding the issue of self-defense. A majority of state
   constitutions allow arms for any citizen in self-defense of himself or
   the state. ^[7] States without any specific provisions regarding this
   clause are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and New
   York. Of these, only Iowa and New Jersey provide a clause for
   "defending life and liberty." ^[8]

   This civil liberty can be approached philosophically as well as
   lawfully. What does the word "arms" exactly mean? What does the word
   "bear" mean in this specific statement? The word "bear" means to carry
   or to hold. The word "arms" means, weapons, but not necessarily
   firearms specifically. When these words are used together, "bear arms"
   could most likely be interpreted by some as a right to carry firearms
   outside of one's home. The topic of whether firearms were or were not
   able to be carried outside the home was not addressed in the District
   of Columbia v. Heller court case.

   "The lawyer who won the Columbia v Heller court case to allow residents
   to keep handguns in their homes is now fighting to allow residents and
   visitors to carry their firearms in public." ^[9] While it is legal to
   carry a concealed firearm in other select states, it is still
   prohibited in the District of Columbia.

Equal protection[edit]

   Main article: Equal Protection Clause

   Equal protection prevents the government from creating laws that are
   discriminatory in application or effect.
