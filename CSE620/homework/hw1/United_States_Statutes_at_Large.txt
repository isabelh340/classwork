   The United States Statutes at Large, commonly referred to as the
   Statutes at Large and abbreviated Stat., is the official record of Acts
   of Congress and concurrent resolutions passed by the United States
   Congress. Each act and resolution of Congress is called a slip law,
   which is classified as either public law (abbreviated Pub.L.) or
   private law (Pvt.L.), and designated and numbered accordingly. At the
   end of a Congress session, slip laws (now commonly called session laws)
   are compiled into Statutes at Large, which are numbered and organised
   by Congress session.^[1] They are part of a three-part model for
   publication of federal statutes consisting of slip laws, session laws
   (Statutes at Large), and codification (United States Code).

Codification[edit]

   Today, large portions of slip laws denominated as public laws are now
   drafted as amendments to the United States Code. Once enacted into law,
   an Act will be published in the Statutes at Large and will add to,
   modify, or delete some part of the United States Code. Provisions of a
   public law that contains only enacting clauses, effective dates, and
   similar matters are not generally codified. Private laws also are not
   generally codified.

   Some portions of the United States Code have been enacted as positive
   law and other portions have not been so enacted. In case of a conflict
   between the text of the Statutes at Large and the text of a provision
   of the United States Code that has not been enacted as positive law,
   the text of the Statutes at Large takes precedence.^[2]

History[edit]

   A few volumes of the Statutes at Large

   Publication of the United States Statutes at Large began in 1845 by the
   private firm of Little, Brown and Company under authority of a joint
   resolution of Congress. During Little, Brown and Company's time as
   publisher, Richard Peters (Volumes 1–8), George Minot (Volumes 9–11),
   and George P. Sanger (Volumes 11–17) served as editors.

   In 1874, Congress transferred the authority to publish the Statutes at
   Large to the Government Printing Office under the direction of the
   Secretary of State.

   Pub.L. 80–278, 61 Stat. 633, was enacted July 30, 1947 and directed the
   Secretary of State to compile, edit, index, and publish the Statutes at
   Large. Pub.L. 81–821, 64 Stat. 980, was enacted September 23, 1950 and
   directed the Administrator of General Services to compile, edit, index,
   and publish the Statutes at Large. Since 1985 the Statutes at Large
   have been prepared and published by the Office of the Federal Register
   (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).^[3]

   Until 1948, all treaties and international agreements approved by the
   United States Senate were also published in the set, but these now
   appear in a publication titled United States Treaties and Other
   International Agreements, abbreviated U.S.T. In addition, the Statutes
   at Large includes the text of the Declaration of Independence, Articles
   of Confederation, the Constitution, amendments to the Constitution,
   treaties with Indians and foreign nations, and presidential
   proclamations.

   Sometimes very large or long Acts of Congress are published as their
   own volume of the Statutes at Large. For example, the Internal Revenue
   Code of 1954 was published as volume 68A of the Statutues at Large (68A
   Stat. 3).
