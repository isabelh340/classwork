   The cinema of the United States, often generally referred to as
   Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since
   the early 20th century. Its history is sometimes separated into four
   main periods: the silent film era, classical Hollywood cinema, New
   Hollywood, and the contemporary period. While the French Lumière
   Brothers are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, it is
   indisputably American cinema that soon became the most dominant force
   in an emerging industry. Since the 1920s, the American film industry
   has grossed more money every year than that of any other country.

   In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to
   capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion picture
   exhibition was given in New York City, using Thomas Edison's
   Kinetoscope. The United States was in the forefront of sound film
   development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the
   U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, Los
   Angeles, California. Picture City, FL was also a planned site for a
   movie picture production center in the 1920s, but due to the 1928
   Okeechobee hurricane, the idea collapsed and Picture City returned to
   its original name of Hobe Sound. Director D. W. Griffith was central to
   the development of film grammar. Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is
   frequently cited in critics' polls as the greatest film of all
   time.^[6]

   American screen actors like John Wayne, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe
   have become iconic figures, while producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was
   a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising. The major film
   studios of Hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially
   successful movies in the world, such as Gone with the Wind (1939), Star
   Wars (1977), Titanic (1997), and Avatar (2009). Today, American film
   studios collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making
   the United States the third most prolific producer of films in the
   world, after Indian cinema and Nigerian cinema.^[7]

History[edit]

   itself, see Hollywood § History.

Origins[edit]

   The second recorded instance of photographs capturing and reproducing
   motion was a series of photographs of a running horse by Eadweard
   Muybridge, which he captured in Palo Alto, California, using a set of
   still cameras placed in a row. Muybridge's accomplishment led inventors
   everywhere to attempt to make similar devices that would capture such
   motion. In the United States, Thomas Edison was among the first to
   produce such a device, the kinetoscope.

   In the earliest days of the American film industry, New York played a
   role. The Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, built during the silent
   film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. Chelsea,
   Manhattan was also frequently used. Mary Pickford, an Academy Award
   winning actress, shot some of her early films in this area. Other major
   centers of film production also included Chicago, Florida, Texas,
   California, and Cuba.

   The film patents wars of the early 20th century led to the spread of
   film companies across the U.S. Many worked with equipment for which
   they did not own the rights, and thus filming in New York could be
   dangerous; it was close to Edison's Company headquarters, and to agents
   the company set out to seize cameras. By 1912, most major film
   companies had set up production facilities in Southern California near
   or in Los Angeles because of the location's proximity to
   Mexico,^[clarification needed] as well as the region's favorable
   year-round weather.^[8]

Rise of Hollywood[edit]

   Main article: Silent film

   In early 1910, director D. W. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company
   to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of actors Blanche
   Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore and others. They
   started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los
   Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories,
   traveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was
   friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there. Griffith then
   filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, In Old California, a
   Biograph melodrama about California in the 19th century, when it
   belonged to Mexico. Griffith stayed there for months and made several
   films before returning to New York. After hearing about Griffith's
   success in Hollywood, in 1913, many movie-makers headed west to avoid
   the fees imposed by Thomas Edison, who owned patents on the
   movie-making process.^[9]

   In Los Angeles, the studios and Hollywood grew. Before World War I,
   movies were made in several U.S. cities, but filmmakers gravitated to
   southern California as the industry developed. They were attracted by
   the mild climate and reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film
   movies outdoors year-round, and by the varied scenery that was
   available. There are several starting points for cinema (particularly
   American cinema), but it was Griffith's controversial 1915 epic Birth
   of a Nation that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still
   dominates celluloid to this day.

   In the early 20th century, when the medium was new, many Jewish
   immigrants found employment in the U.S. film industry. They were able
   to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of short
   films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons, after their admission
   price of a nickel (five cents). Within a few years, ambitious men like
   Samuel Goldwyn, William Fox, Carl Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer
   and the Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched
   to the production side of the business. Soon they were the heads of a
   new kind of enterprise: the movie studio. (It is worth noting that the
   U.S. had at least one female director, producer and studio head in
   these early years, Alice Guy-Blaché.) They also set the stage for the
   industry's internationalism; the industry is often accused of
   Amero-centric provincialism.

   Other moviemakers arrived from Europe after World War I: directors like
   Ernst Lubitsch, Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir; and
   actors like Rudolph Valentino, Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman and
   Charles Boyer. They joined a homegrown supply of actors — lured west
   from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films — to
   form one of the 20th century's most remarkable growth industries. At
   motion pictures' height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios
   were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an
   audience of 90 million Americans per week.^[10]
   The Hollywood Sign in the Hollywood Hills has become a landmark
   representing the Southern California film industry.

   Sound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s.^[11]
   After The Jazz Singer, the first film with synchronized voices, was
   successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927, Hollywood film
   companies would respond to Warner Bros. and begin to use Vitaphone
   sound — which Warner Bros. owned until 1928 – in future films. By May
   1928, Electrical Research Product Incorporated (ERPI), a subsidiary of
   the Western Electric company, gained a monopoly over film sound
   distribution.^[10]

   A side effect of the "talkies" was that many actors who had made their
   careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work, as they
   often had bad voices or could not remember their lines. Meanwhile, in
   1922, US politician Will H. Hays left politics and formed the movie
   studio boss organization known as the Motion Pictures Distributors
   Association of America (MPDAA) [1]. The organization became the Motion
   Picture Association of America after Hays retired in 1945.

   In the early times of talkies, American studios found that their sound
   productions were rejected in foreign-language markets and even among
   speakers of other dialects of English. The synchronization technology
   was still too primitive for dubbing. One of the solutions was creating
   parallel foreign-language versions of Hollywood films. Around 1930, the
   American companies opened a studio in Joinville-le-Pont, France, where
   the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different
   time-sharing crews.

   Also, foreign unemployed actors, playwrights and winners of photogenia
   contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood, where they shot parallel
   versions of the English-language films. These parallel versions had a
   lower budget, were shot at night and were directed by second-line
   American directors who did not speak the foreign language. The
   Spanish-language crews included people like Luis Buñuel, Enrique
   Jardiel Poncela, Xavier Cugat and Edgar Neville. The productions were
   not very successful in their intended markets, due to the following
   reasons:
     * The lower budgets were apparent.

     * Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema.

     * The original movies were often second-rate themselves, since
       studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves.

     * The mix of foreign accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean for
       example in the Spanish case) was odd for the audiences.

     * Some markets lacked sound-equipped theaters.

   In spite of this, some productions like the Spanish version of Dracula
   compare favorably with the original. By the mid-1930s, synchronization
   had advanced enough for dubbing to become usual.

   During the Golden Age of Hollywood, which lasted from the end of the
   silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s,
   thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios. The start
   of the Golden Age was arguably when The Jazz Singer was released in
   1927, ending the silent era and increasing box-office profits for films
   as sound was introduced to feature films.

   Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula – Western,
   slapstick comedy, musical, animated cartoon, biographical film
   (biographical picture) – and the same creative teams often worked on
   films made by the same studio. For example, Cedric Gibbons and Herbert
   Stothart always worked on MGM films, Alfred Newman worked at 20th
   Century Fox for twenty years, Cecil B. De Mille's films were almost all
   made at Paramount, and director Henry King's films were mostly made for
   20th Century Fox.

   At the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film,
   largely because of the actors who appeared in it; MGM, for example,
   claimed it had contracted "more stars than there are in heaven." Each
   studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it
   possible to know this – a trait that does not exist today.
   The singer and actress Carmen Miranda participated in 14 films in
   Hollywood from 1940 to 1953.

   For example, To Have and Have Not (1944) is famous not only for the
   first pairing of actors Humphrey Bogart (1899–1957) and Lauren Bacall
   (1924–2014), but also for being written by two future winners of the
   Nobel Prize in Literature: Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961), the author of
   the novel on which the script was nominally based, and William Faulkner
   (1897–1962), who worked on the screen adaptation.

   After The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, Warner Bros. gained huge
   success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters,
   after purchasing Stanley Theaters and First National Productions in
   1928. MGM had also owned the Loews string of theaters since forming in
   1924, and the Fox Film Corporation owned the Fox Theatre strings as
   well. Also, RKO (a 1928 merger between Keith-Orpheum Theaters and the
   Radio Corporation of America^[12]) responded to the Western
   Electric/ERPI monopoly over sound in films, and developed their own
   method, known as Photophone, to put sound in films.^[10]

   Paramount, which already acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would
   answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO, and buy a number of
   theaters in the late 1920s as well, and would hold a monopoly on
   theaters in Detroit, Michigan.^[13] By the 1930s, almost all of the
   first-run metropolitan theaters in the United States were owned by the
   Big Five studios – MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros., and 20th
   Century Fox.^[14]

The studio system[edit]

   Main article: The Hays Code

   Movie-making was still a business however, and motion picture companies
   made money by operating under the studio system. The major studios kept
   thousands of people on salary — actors, producers, directors, writers,
   stunt men, craftspersons, and technicians. They owned or leased Movie
   Ranches in rural Southern California for location shooting of westerns
   and other large-scale genre films. And they owned hundreds of theaters
   in cities and towns across the nation, theaters that showed their films
   and that were always in need of fresh material.

   In 1930, MPDAA President Will Hays created the Hays (Production) Code,
   which followed censorship guidelines and went into effect after
   government threats of censorship expanded by 1930.^[15] However, the
   code was never enforced until 1934, after the Catholic watchdog
   organization The Legion of Decency – appalled by some of the
   provocative films and lurid advertising of the era later classified
   Pre-Code Hollywood- threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it
   didn't go into effect.^[16] Those films that didn't obtain a seal of
   approval from the Production Code Administration had to pay a $25,000
   fine and could not profit in the theaters, as the MPDAA owned every
   theater in the country through the Big Five studios.

   Throughout the 1930s, as well as most of the golden age, MGM dominated
   the film screen and had the top stars in Hollywood, and was also
   credited for creating the Hollywood star system altogether.^[17] Some
   MGM stars included "King of Hollywood" Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore,
   Jean Harlow, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Jeanette
   MacDonald and husband Gene Raymond, Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland, and
   Gene Kelly.^[17] But MGM did not stand alone. Another great achievement
   of US cinema during this era came through Walt Disney's animation
   company. In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time,
   Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.^[18] This distinction was promptly
   topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still, when
   adjusted for inflation, the most successful film of all time, Gone with
   the Wind.^[19]

   Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema
   that emerged from this period of highly regimented film-making. One
   reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not
   every one had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget
   feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: Citizen Kane,
   directed by Orson Welles (1915–1985) and often regarded as the greatest
   film of all time, fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed
   directors like Howard Hawks (1896–1977), Alfred Hitchcock (1899–1980)
   and Frank Capra (1897–1991) battled the studios in order to achieve
   their artistic visions.

   The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw
   the release of such classics as The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind,
   Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Only
   Angels Have Wings, Ninotchka and Midnight. Among the other films from
   the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics:
   Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, It Happened One Night, the original
   King Kong, Mutiny on the Bounty, Top Hat, City Lights, Red River, The
   Lady from Shanghai, Rear Window, On the Waterfront, Rebel Without a
   Cause, Some Like It Hot and The Manchurian Candidate.

Black roles[edit]

   Stormyposter.jpg

   Stormy Weather (1943) (starring Lena Horne, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson
   and Cab Calloway's Band), along with Cabin in the Sky (1943) (starring
   Ethel Waters, Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, Lena Horne and Louis
   "Stachmo" Armstrong), and other musicals of the 1940s opened new roles
   for Blacks in Hollywood. They broke through old stereotypes and far
   surpassed the limited, poorly paid roles available in race films
   produced for all-black audiences.^[20]^[21]

Decline of the studio system (late 1940s)[edit]

   Percentage of the US population that went to the cinema on average,
   weekly, 1930-2000

   The studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two
   forces that developed in the late 1940s:
     * a federal antitrust action that separated the production of films
       from their exhibition; and

     * the advent of television.

   In 1938, Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released
   during a run of lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly
   became the highest-grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly
   for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that
   did not feature any studio-employed stars.^[22] This stoked already
   widespread frustration at the practice of block-booking, in which
   studios would only sell an entire year's schedule of films at a time to
   theaters and use the lock-in to cover for releases of mediocre quality.

   Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold—a noted "trust buster" of the
   Roosevelt administration — took this opportunity to initiate
   proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938
   for violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.^[23]^[24] The federal
   suit resulted in five of the eight studios (the "Big Five": Warner
   Bros., MGM, Fox, RKO and Paramount) reaching a compromise with Arnold
   in October 1940 and signing a consent decree agreeing to, within three
   years:
     * Eliminate the block-booking of short film subjects, in an
       arrangement known as "one shot", or "full force" block-booking.

     * Eliminate the block-booking of any more than five features in their
       theaters.

     * No longer engage in blind buying (or the buying of films by theater
       districts without seeing films beforehand) and instead have
       trade-showing, in which all 31 theater districts in US would see
       films every two weeks before showing movies in theaters.

     * Set up an administration board in each theater district to enforce
       these requirements.^[23]

   The "Little Three" (Universal Studios, United Artists, and Columbia
   Pictures), who did not own any theaters, refused to participate in the
   consent decree.^[23]^[24] A number of independent film producers were
   also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the
   Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for
   the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters — as Paramount
   was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope, Paulette
   Goddard, Veronica Lake, Betty Hutton, crooner Bing Crosby, Alan Ladd,
   and longtime actor for studio Gary Cooper too- by 1942. The Big Five
   studios didn't meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during
   WWII, without major consequence, but after the war ended they joined
   Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood anti-trust case, as did the
   Little Three studios.^[25]

   The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the major studios ownership of
   theaters and film distribution was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust
   Act. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical
   staff from their contracts with the studios. This changed the paradigm
   of film making by the major Hollywood studios, as each could have an
   entirely different cast and creative team.

   The decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics which
   made Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios,
   Columbia Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox films immediately
   identifiable. Certain movie people, such as Cecil B. DeMille, either
   remained contract artists till the end of their careers or used the
   same creative teams on their films, so that a DeMille film still looked
   like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956.

Impact: Fewer films, larger individual budgets[edit]

   Also, the number of movies being produced annually dropped as the
   average budget soared, marking a major change in strategy for the
   industry. Studios now aimed to produce entertainment that could not be
   offered by television: spectacular, larger-than-life productions.
   Studios also began to sell portions of their theatrical film libraries
   to other companies to sell to television. By 1949, all major film
   studios had given up ownership of their theaters.

   Television was also instrumental in the decline of Hollywood's Golden
   Age as it broke the movie industry's hegemony in American
   entertainment. Despite this, the film industry was also able to gain
   some leverage for future films as longtime government censorship faded
   in the 1950s. After the Paramount anti-trust case ended, Hollywood
   movie studios no longer owned theaters, and thus made it so foreign
   films could be released in American theaters without censorship.

   This was complemented with the 1952 Miracle Decision in the Joseph
   Burstyn Inc. v Wilson case, in which the Supreme Court of the United
   States reversed its earlier position, from 1915's Mutual Film
   Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio case, and stated that
   motion pictures were a form of art and were entitled to the protection
   of the First amendment; US laws could no longer censor films. By 1968,
   with film studios becoming increasingly defiant to its censorship
   function, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) had replaced
   the Hays Code–which was now greatly violated after the government
   threat of censorship that justified the origin of the code had
   ended—with the film rating system.

New Hollywood and post-classical cinema (1950s-1980s)[edit]

   Main article: New Hollywood
   James Dean was a movie star who became a symbol of young people for his
   role in the movie Rebel Without a Cause.

   Post-classical cinema is the term used to describe the changing methods
   of storytelling in the New Hollywood. It has been argued that new
   approaches to drama and characterization played upon audience
   expectations acquired in the classical period: chronology may be
   scrambled, storylines may feature "twist endings", and lines between
   the antagonist and protagonist may be blurred. The roots of
   post-classical storytelling may be seen in film noir, in Rebel Without
   a Cause (1955), and in Hitchcock's storyline-shattering Psycho.

   The New Hollywood describes the emergence of a new generation of film
   school-trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in
   Europe in the 1960s; The 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde marked the
   beginning of American cinema rebounding as well, as a new generation of
   films would afterwards gain success at the box offices as well.^[26]
   Filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese,
   Roman Polanski, and William Friedkin came to produce fare that paid
   homage to the history of film, and developed upon existing genres and
   techniques.

   In the early 1970s, the films of New Hollywood filmmakers were often
   both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. While the early
   New Hollywood films like Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider had been
   relatively low-budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased
   sexuality and violence, the enormous success enjoyed by Friedkin with
   The Exorcist, Spielberg with Jaws, Coppola with The Godfather and
   Apocalypse Now, Scorsese with Taxi Driver and Lucas with American
   Graffiti, and Star Wars, respectively helped to give rise to the modern
   "blockbuster", and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying
   to produce enormous hits.^[27]

   The increasing indulgence of these young directors did not
   help.^[citation needed] Often, they’d go overschedule, and overbudget,
   thus bankrupting themselves or the studio.^[citation needed] The three
   most famous examples of this are Coppola’s Apocalypse Now and One From
   The Heart and particularly Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate, which
   single-handedly bankrupted United Artists. However, Apocalypse Now
   eventually made its money back and gained widespread recognition as a
   masterpiece, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes.^[28]

Rise of the home video market (1980s-1990s)[edit]

   The 1980s and 1990s saw another significant development. The full
   acceptance of home video by studios opened a vast new business to
   exploit. Films such as Batman, Showgirls, The Secret of NIMH and The
   Shawshank Redemption, which may have performed poorly in their
   theatrical run, were now able to find success in the video market. It
   also saw the first generation of film makers with access to video tapes
   emerge. Directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson
   had been able to view thousands of films and produced films with vast
   numbers of references and connections to previous works.

   This, along with the explosion of independent film and ever-decreasing
   costs for filmmaking, changed the landscape of American movie-making
   once again, and led a renaissance of filmmaking among Hollywood's lower
   and middle-classes—those without access to studio financial resources.
   With the rise of the DVD in the 21st century, DVDs have quickly become
   even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of
   packaging extra scenes, extended versions, and commentary tracks with
   the films.

Modern cinema[edit]

   From left: (top row) Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce
   Willis, Steven Seagal (bottom row) Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van
   Damme, Wesley Snipes, Jackie Chan.

   The drive to produce a spectacle on the movie screen has largely shaped
   American cinema ever since.^[citation needed] Spectacular epics which
   took advantage of new widescreen processes had been increasingly
   popular from the 1950s onwards. Since then, American films have become
   increasingly divided into two categories: Blockbusters and independent
   films.

   Studios have focused on relying on a handful of extremely expensive
   releases every year in order to remain profitable. Such blockbusters
   emphasize spectacle, star power, and high production value, all of
   which entail an enormous budget. Blockbusters typically rely upon star
   power and massive advertising to attract a huge audience.^[citation
   needed] A successful blockbuster will attract an audience large enough
   to offset production costs and reap considerable profits.

   Such productions carry a substantial risk of failure, and most studios
   release blockbusters that both over- and underperform in a
   year.^[citation needed] Classic blockbusters from this period include
   E.T., Back to the Future, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, Wall Street, Rain
   Man, Titanic, The Matrix, The Green Mile, The Sixth Sense, Star Wars
   Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Gangs of New York and The Bourne
   Identity.^[29]

   Studios supplement these movies with independent productions, made with
   small budgets and often independently of the studio corporation. Movies
   made in this manner typically emphasize high professional quality in
   terms of acting, directing, screenwriting, and other elements
   associated with production, and also upon creativity and
   innovation.^[citation needed] These movies usually rely upon critical
   praise or niche marketing to garner an audience. Because of an
   independent film's low budget, a successful independent film can have a
   high profit-to-cost ratio, while a failure will incur minimal losses,
   allowing for studios to sponsor dozens^[citation needed] of such
   productions in addition to their high-stakes releases.

   American independent cinema was revitalized^[citation needed] in the
   late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers,
   including Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Kevin Smith, and Quentin
   Tarantino made movies like, respectively: Do the Right Thing; Sex,
   Lies, and Videotape; Clerks; and Reservoir Dogs. In terms of directing,
   screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were
   innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the
   conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable
   financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished
   the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the
   independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more
   influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have
   capitalised on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar
   films; for example Fox Searchlight Pictures.

   To a lesser degree in the early 21st century, film types that were
   previously considered^[citation needed] to have only a minor presence
   in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American
   box office draws. These include foreign-language films such as
   Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero and documentary films such as
   Super Size Me, March of the Penguins, and Michael Moore's Bowling for
   Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11.

   According to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, 2013 has seen "the
   industry at an extraordinary time of upheaval, where even proven
   talents find it difficult to get movies into theaters"; Spielberg
   predicts "there's eventually going to be an implosion — or a big
   meltdown. There's going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe
   even a half-dozen megabudget movies are going to go crashing into the
   ground, and that's going to change the paradigm", with Lucas suggesting
   movie theaters following "a Broadway play model, whereby fewer movies
   are released, they stay in theaters for a year and ticket prices are
   much higher."^[31]

Hollywood and politics[edit]

   Main article: Good Neighbor policy

   In the 1930s the Democrats and the Republicans saw money in Hollywood.
   President Franklin Roosevelt saw a huge partnership with Hollywood. He
   used the first real potential of Hollywood’s stars in a national
   campaign. Melvyn Douglas toured Washington in 1939 and met the key New
   Dealers.^[citation needed]

Political endorsements[edit]

   Endorsements letters from leading actors were signed, radio appearances
   and printed advertising were made. Movie stars were used to draw a
   large audience into the political view of the party. By the 1960s, John
   F. Kennedy was a new, young face for Washington, and his strong
   friendship with Frank Sinatra exemplified this new era of glamor. The
   last moguls of Hollywood were gone and younger, newer executives and
   producers began generating more liberal ideas.

   Celebrities and money attracted politicians into the high-class,
   glittering Hollywood life-style. As Ronald Brownstein wrote in his book
   “The Power and the Glitter”, television in the 1970s and 1980s was an
   enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that
   media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs, like Jane
   Fonda against the Vietnam War.^[32] This era saw former actor Ronald
   Reagan became Governor of California and subsequently become President
   of the United States. It continued with Arnold Schwarzenegger as
   California’s Governor in 2003.

Political donations[edit]

   Today Washington’s interest is in Hollywood donations.^[33] On February
   20, 2007, for example, Barack Obama had a $2300-a-plate Hollywood gala,
   being hosted by DreamWorks founders David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg
   and Steven Spielberg at the Beverly Hilton.^[33] Hollywood is a huge
   donator for presidential campaigns and this money attracts politicians.
   Not only is Hollywood influencing Washington with its glamour and money
   but Washington also influences Hollywood.^[34]

Spread to world markets[edit]

   In 1912, American film companies were largely immersed in the
   competition for the domestic market. It was difficult to satisfy the
   huge demand for films created by the nickelodeon boom. Motion Picture
   Patents Company members such as Edison Studios, also sought to limit
   competition from French, Italian and other imported films. It was
   expected that a great deal of money was to be made in exporting films.
   Vitagraph Studios was the first American company to open its own
   distribution offices in Europe, establishing a branch in London in
   1906, and a second branch in Paris shortly after.^[35]

   Other American companies were moving into foreign markets as well, and
   American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid-1920s.
   Originally, a majority of companies sold their films indirectly.
   However, since they were inexperienced in overseas trading, they simply
   sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or
   export agents. Gradually, London became a center for the international
   circulation of U.S. films.^[36]

   Many British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this
   business, and by doing so, they weakened British production by turning
   over a large share of the UK market to American films. By 1911,
   approximately 60 to 70 percent of films imported into Great Britain
   were American. The United States was also doing well in Germany,
   Australia and New Zealand.^[37]

   More recently, as globalization has started to intensify, and the
   United States government has been actively promoting free trade agendas
   and trade on cultural products, which led Hollywood into becoming a
   world-wide cultural source. The success on Hollywood export markets can
   be known not only from the boom of American multinational media
   corporations across the globe, but also from the unique ability to make
   big-budget films that appeal powerfully to popular tastes in many
   different cultures.^[38]

   In the meantime, Hollywood has delved deeper into Chinese markets,
   influenced by China’s censorship. Films made in China are censored
   strictly avoiding themes like “ghosts, violence, murder, horror and
   demons." Otherwise, the plot might be cut. In order to get more funding
   on films, Hollywood has had to make “approved” films, adding more and
   more Chinese elements, but not considered as high art any more for
   pursuit of profitable box office. Even Chinese audiences found it
   boring to wait for the release of great American movies dubbed in their
   native language.^[39]
