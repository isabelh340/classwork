   Politics of the United States Virgin Islands takes place in a framework
   of a presidential representative democratic dependency, whereby the
   Governor is the head of the local government, and of a multi-party
   system. The United States Virgin Islands are an unincorporated and
   organized territory of the United States, administered by the Office of
   Insular Affairs of the United States Department of the Interior.
   Executive power is exercised by the local government of the Virgin
   Islands. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the
   legislature.

   Virgin Islands residents are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in United
   States presidential election and cannot elect voting members of
   Congress. However, in the U.S. House of Representatives, they are
   represented by a delegate, who can vote in congressional committees but
   not in the House itself. Virgin Islands residents can vote fully in all
   elections if they become a resident of one of the 50 U.S. states, while
   residents of one of the 50 states who become residents of the Virgin
   Islands can no longer vote for President or for voting members of
   Congress.

   A federal lawsuit since 2011 in the District Court of the Virgin
   Islands and now before the Washington, D.C., Circuit Court is
   currently^[1] pending to provide Virgin Islanders with the fundamental
   right to be represented in Congress and vote for U.S. President.^[2]
   The federal case is Civil No. 3:11-cv-110, Charles v. U.S. Federal
   Elections Commission.^[3] A similar case was filed in the Superior
   Court of the Virgin Islands against the local Board of Elections.^[4]
   The cases allege it was racial discrimination present in an all-white
   and segregated Congress of 1917 that was the impetus to deny the right
   to vote to a majority non-white constituency.^[5] The local case is
   also pending a decision.

Law[edit]

   The Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands of 1954 ^[6] is the
   current Organic Act defining the government of the United States Virgin
   Islands, which were acquired by the United States through the Treaty of
   the Danish West Indies of 1916. It replaced the Organic Act of the
   Virgin Islands of 1936^[7] and earlier temporary provisions.^[8]

   It was subsequently amended in 1958 to prohibit political or religious
   tests, but required a loyalty oath as qualification to any office or
   public trust.^[9] The Virgin Islands Elective Governor Act ^[10] made
   the Governor an elected office,^[11] and further amendments in 1984
   removed the right to indictment for certain crimes and the jurisdiction
   of the admiralty courts.^[12]

   There have been several attempts at a constitution. The most recent
   attempt was the Fifth Constitutional Convention of the U.S. Virgin
   Islands which passed a proposed constitution in May 2009 but was
   rejected by Congress in June 2010.

   body.
