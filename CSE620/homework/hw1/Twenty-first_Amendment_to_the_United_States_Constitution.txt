   Amendment XXI in the National Archives

   The Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States
   Constitution repealed the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States
   Constitution, which had mandated nationwide Prohibition on alcohol on
   January 17, 1920. The Twenty-first Amendment was ratified on December
   5, 1933. It is unique among the 27 amendments of the U.S. Constitution
   for being the only one to have been ratified by state ratifying
   conventions.

Text[edit]

     Section 1. The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution
     of the United States is hereby repealed.

     Section 2. The transportation or importation into any State,
     Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use
     therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof,
     is hereby prohibited.

     Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have
     been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in
     the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven
     years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the
     Congress.

Background[edit]

   Main articles: Prohibition in the United States and Volstead Act

   The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had ushered in a period
   known as Prohibition, during which the manufacture, distribution, and
   sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth
   Amendment in 1919 was the crowning achievement of the temperance
   movement, but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime rates soared under
   Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from
   a profitable, often violent black market for alcohol. The federal
   government was incapable of stemming the tide: enforcement of the
   Volstead Act proved to be a nearly impossible task and corruption was
   rife among law enforcement agencies.^[1] In 1932, wealthy industrialist
   John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter:

     When Prohibition was introduced, I hoped that it would be widely
     supported by public opinion and the day would soon come when the
     evil effects of alcohol would be recognized. I have slowly and
     reluctantly come to believe that this has not been the result.
     Instead, drinking has generally increased; the speakeasy has
     replaced the saloon; a vast army of lawbreakers has appeared; many
     of our best citizens have openly ignored Prohibition; respect for
     the law has been greatly lessened; and crime has increased to a
     level never seen before.^[2]

   As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a
   political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated
   by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two
   methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had
   been used up until that time; and that was for ratification by the
   state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom
   of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either beholden
   to or simply fearful of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when
   Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20,
   1933 (with the requisite two-thirds having voted in favor in each
   house; 63 to 21 in the United States Senate and 289 to 121 in the
   United States House of Representatives), they chose the other
   ratification method established by Article V, that being via state
   conventions. The Twenty-first Amendment is the only constitutional
   amendment ratified by state conventions rather than by the state
   legislatures.

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   The Congress proposed the Twenty-first Amendment on February 20,
   1933.^[3]

   The proposed amendment was adopted on December 5, 1933. It is the only
   amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions,
   specially selected for the purpose.^[4] All other amendments have been
   ratified by state legislatures. It is also the only amendment that was
   approved for the explicit purpose of repealing a previously existing
   amendment to the Constitution. The Twenty-first Amendment ending
   national prohibition became officially effective on December 15, though
   people started drinking openly before that date.^[5]

   The various responses of the 48 states is as follows:

   The following states ratified the amendment:
    1. Michigan (April 10, 1933)

    2. Montana (August 6, 1934)

   The amendment was rejected by the following state:
    1. South Carolina (December 4, 1933)

   Voters in the following state rejected holding a convention to consider
   the amendment:

    1. Georgia
    2. Kansas
    3. Louisiana
    4. Mississippi
    5. Nebraska
    6. North Dakota
    7. Oklahoma
    8. South Dakota

Implementation[edit]

State and local control[edit]

   The second section bans the importation of alcohol in violation of
   state or territorial law. This has been interpreted to give states
   essentially absolute control over alcoholic beverages, and many U.S.
   states still remained "dry" (with state prohibition of alcohol) long
   after its ratification. Mississippi was the last, remaining dry until
   1966;^[6] Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987.^[7] Many
   states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this
   Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both), which has led
   to many lawsuits over First Amendment rights when local governments
   have tried to revoke liquor licenses.

Court rulings[edit]

   Section 2 has been the source of every Supreme Court ruling directly
   addressing Twenty-first Amendment issues.

   Early rulings suggested that Section 2 enabled states to legislate with
   exceptionally broad constitutional powers. In State Board of
   Equalization v. Young's Market Co., 299 U.S. 59 (1936), the Supreme
   Court recognized that "Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would
   obviously have been unconstitutional"^[8] for a state to require a
   license and fee to import beer anywhere within its borders. First, the
   Court held that Section 2 abrogated the right to import intoxicating
   liquors free of a direct burden on interstate commerce, which otherwise
   would have been unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause before
   passage of the Twenty-first Amendment.^[9] In its second holding, the
   Court rejected an equal protection claim because "A classification
   recognized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by
   the Fourteenth."^[10] Over time, the Court has significantly curtailed
   this initial interpretation.

   In Craig v. Boren (1976), the Supreme Court found that analysis under
   the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had not been
   affected by the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment. Although the
   Court did not specify whether the Twenty-first Amendment could provide
   an exception to any other constitutional protections outside of the
   Commerce Clause, it acknowledged "the relevance of the Twenty-first
   Amendment to other constitutional provisions becomes increasingly
   doubtful."^[11] Likewise, it has been held that Section 2 of the
   Twenty-first Amendment does not affect the Supremacy Clause^[12] or the
   Establishment Clause.^[13] However, the Craig v. Boren Court did
   distinguish two characteristics of state laws permitted by the
   Amendment, which otherwise might have run afoul of the Constitution.
   The constitutional issues in each centered or touched upon:(1)
   "importation of intoxicants, a regulatory area where the State's
   authority under the Twenty-first Amendment is transparently
   clear;"^[14] and (2) "purely economic matters that traditionally merit
   only the mildest review under the Fourteenth Amendment." ^[15] As to
   the Dormant Commerce Clause in particular, the Court clarified that,
   while not a pro tanto repeal, the Twenty-First Amendment nonetheless
   "primarily created an exception to the normal operation of the Commerce
   Clause."^[16]

   In South Dakota v. Dole (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the
   withholding of some federal highway funds^[17] to South Dakota, because
   beer with an alcohol content below a specified percentage could be
   lawfully sold to adults under the age of 21 within the state.^[18] In a
   7–2 majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court held that
   the offer of benefits is not coercion that inappropriately invades
   state sovereignty.^[19] The Twenty-first Amendment could not constitute
   an "independent constitutional bar" to the spending power granted to
   Congress under Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the Constitution.^[20]
   Justice Brennan, author of the majority opinion in Craig v. Boren,
   provided a brief but notable dissent based solely on Section 2.^[21]
   Justice O'Connor also dissented, arguing that "the regulation of the
   age of the purchasers of liquor, just as the regulation of the price at
   which liquor may be sold, falls squarely within the scope of those
   powers reserved to the States by the Twenty-first Amendment."^[22]

   In 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996), the Court held states
   cannot use the Twenty-first Amendment to abridge freedom of speech
   protections under the First Amendment.^[23] Rhode Island imposed a law
   that prohibited advertisements that disclosed the retail prices of
   alcoholic beverages sold to the public. In declaring the law
   unconstitutional, the Court reiterated that "although the Twenty-first
   Amendment limits the effect of the Dormant Commerce Clause on a State's
   regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicating beverages
   within its borders, the Amendment does not license the States to ignore
   their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution."^[24]

   Most recently, however, Granholm v. Heald (2005) held that the
   Twenty-first Amendment does not overrule the Dormant Commerce Clause
   with respect to alcohol sales, and therefore states must treat in-state
   and out-of-state wineries equally. The Court criticized its earliest
   rulings on the issue, (including State Board of Equalization v. Young's
   Market Co.) and promulgated its most limited interpretation to date:

     The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to
     maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by
     regulating its transportation, importation, and use. The Amendment
     did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order
     to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege they had not
     enjoyed at any earlier time.^[25]

   In a lengthy dissent, Justice Thomas argued that the plain meaning of
   Section 2 removed "any doubt regarding its broad scope, the Amendment
   simplified the language of the Webb-Kenyon Act and made it clear that
   States could regulate importation destined for in-state delivery free
   of negative Commerce Clause restraints."^[26] In his historical
   account, Justice Thomas argued the early precedent provided by State
   Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co. was indeed correct, and
   furthered the original intent of the Twenty-first Amendment to provide
   a constitutional guarantee authorizing state regulation that might
   conflict with the Dormant Commerce Clause (similar to the Webb–Kenyon
   Act).
