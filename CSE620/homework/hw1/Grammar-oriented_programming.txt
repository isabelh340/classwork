   Grammar-oriented programming (GOP) and Grammar-oriented Object Design
   (GOOD) are good for designing and creating a domain-specific
   programming language (DSL) for a specific business domain.

   GOOD can be used to drive the execution of the application or it can be
   used to embed the declarative processing logic of a context-aware
   component (CAC) or context-aware service (CAS). GOOD is a method for
   creating and maintaining dynamically reconfigurable software
   architectures driven by business-process architectures. The business
   compiler was used to capture business processes within real-time
   workshops for various lines of business and create an executable
   simulation of the processes used.

   Instead of using one DSL for the entire programming activity, GOOD
   suggests the combination of defining domain-specific behavioral
   semantics in conjunction with the use of more traditional, general
   purpose programming languages.
