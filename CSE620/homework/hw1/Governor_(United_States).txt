   In the United States, the title governor refers to the chief executive
   of each state or insular territory, not directly subordinate to the
   federal authorities, but the political and ceremonial head of the
   state.

Role and powers[edit]

   See also: Seals of Governors of the U.S. States and Flags of Governors
   of the U.S. States

   The United States Constitution preserves the notion that the country is
   a federation of semi-sovereign states and that powers not specifically
   granted to the federal government are retained by the states. States,
   therefore, are not merely provinces or subdivisions of federal
   administration. State governments in the U.S. are relatively powerful;
   each state has its own independent criminal and civil law codes, and
   each state manages its internal government.

   The governor thus heads the executive branch in each state or territory
   and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable
   control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many
   officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in
   legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, such as that
   of commander-in-chief of the state's National Guard (when not
   federalized), and in many states and territories the governor has
   partial or absolute power to commute or pardon a criminal sentence. All
   U.S. governors serve four-year terms except those in New Hampshire and
   Vermont, who serve two-year terms.

   In all states, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has
   considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the
   state legislature and in some cases by other elected executive
   officials. In the five extant U.S. territories, all governors are now
   directly elected as well, though in the past many territorial governors
   were historically appointed by the President of the United States.
   Governors can veto state bills, and in all but seven states they have
   the power of the line-item veto on appropriations bills (a power the
   President does not have). In some cases legislatures can override a
   gubernatorial veto by a two-thirds vote, in others by three-fifths. In
   Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, the governor's veto can be
   overridden by a simple majority vote, making it virtually useless. In
   Arkansas, a gubernatorial veto may be overridden by an absolute
   majority. The Governor of North Carolina had no veto power until a 1996
   referendum. In 47 of the 50 states, whenever there is a vacancy of one
   of the state's U.S. Senate seats, that state's governor has the power
   to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until a special election is
   held; the governors of Oregon, Alaska, and Wisconsin do not have this
   power.^[1]

   A state governor may give an annual State of the State address in order
   to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report
   annually (or in older constitutions described as being "from time to
   time") on the state or condition of the state. Governors of states may
   also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring
   state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations or attending the
   state fair. The governor may also have an official residence (see
   Governor's Mansion).

   Beyle, in a ranking of the power of the governorship in all 50 states,
   makes the distinction between "personal powers" of governors, which are
   factors that vary from person to person, season to season- and the
   "institutional powers" that are set in place by law. Examples of
   measurable personal factors are how large a governor's margin of
   victory was on election day, and where he stands in public opinion
   polls. Whether a governor has strong budget controls, appointment
   authority, and veto powers are examples of institutional powers.

History[edit]

   Main article: Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies

   In colonial North America, governors were chosen in a variety of ways,
   depending on how the colony was organized. In the crown colonies of
   Great Britain, France, and Spain, the governor was chosen by the ruling
   monarch of the colonizing power, or his designees; in British colonies,
   the Board of Trade was often the primary decision maker. Colonies based
   on a corporate charter, such as the Connecticut Colony and the
   Massachusetts Bay Colony, elected their own governors based on rules
   spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation. In
   proprietary colonies, such as the Province of Carolina before it became
   a crown colony (and was divided into North and South), governors were
   chosen by the Lords Proprietor who controlled the colony. In the early
   years of the American Revolutionary War, eleven of the Thirteen
   Colonies evicted (with varying levels of violence) royal and
   proprietary governors. The other two colonies (Connecticut and Rhode
   Island) had corporate charters; Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull
   was governor before and during the war period, while in Rhode Island,
   Governor Joseph Wanton was removed from office in 1775 for failing to
   support the rebel war effort.

   Before achieving statehood, many of the 50 states were territories.
   Administered by the federal government, they had governors who were
   appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate rather than
   elected by the resident population. Election of territorial governors
   began in Puerto Rico in 1948. The last appointed territorial governor,
   Hyrum Rex Lee in American Samoa, left office in 1978.

Demographics[edit]

Party[edit]

   State Governors by political party.
   Key:
     Democratic
     Republican
     Independent

   There are currently 29 Republicans and 21 Democrats serving as state
   governors. Two Democrats (including one from the Popular Democratic
   Party of Puerto Rico), one Republican, and one independent also occupy
   territorial governorships. No other third parties hold a Governorship.

Tenure[edit]

   For each term, governors serve 4 years in office. The exceptions are
   Vermont and New Hampshire where tenures are two years long.

   The longest-serving current governor is Terry Branstad of Iowa, who is
   currently serving his fifth non-consecutive term. He previously served
   for four consecutive terms from 1983 to 1999. The second
   longest-serving current governor is Rick Perry of Texas, who was sworn
   in on December 21, 2000. The newest governor is Terry McAuliffe of
   Virginia, who was sworn in on January 11, 2014.

   In the majority of states, term limits cap a governor's tenure. See
   details at Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits

Age[edit]

   The oldest current governor is Jerry Brown of California, at age 76.
   The youngest current governor is Nikki Haley of South Carolina, at age
   42.

   The youngest person to ever serve as a governor in the United States
   was Stevens T. Mason of the Michigan Territory, elected in 1835 having
   just turned 24. Mason would later become the first governor of the
   state of Michigan when it was admitted to the Union in January 1837,
   when he was 25. Mason was re-elected in November 1837, then age 26.^[2]

   The second youngest governor ever elected was J. Neely Johnson of
   California, when he was elected in 1855 at the age of 30, and the third
   youngest governor was Harold Stassen of Minnesota, when he was elected
   in 1938 at age 31.^[3] When future President Bill Clinton was elected
   Governor of Arkansas in 1978 at age 32, he became the youngest governor
   since Stassen.

   In 14 states, the minimum age requirement of the governor is 30, though
   in some it is 25 (7), 21 (1), or 18 (5). Oklahoma is the only state
   with an older age, 31. Some states require the governor to be a
   qualified elector/voter, implying a minimum age of 18. Kansas and
   Vermont do not have an explicit or implicit age requirement.
   State Governors by religious preference.

Gender[edit]

   Main article: List of female state governors in the United States

   There are currently 45 male state governors. There are 5 female
   governors: Jan Brewer of Arizona, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Nikki Haley
   of South Carolina, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Susana Martinez
   of New Mexico. Of those, Brewer, Fallin, Haley, and Martinez are
   Republicans, while Hassan is a Democrat.

   All five territorial governors are men.

   Thirty-one women have been or are currently serving as the governor,
   including two in an acting capacity.

   The first female governor was Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming who was
   elected on November 4, 1924 and sworn in on January 5, 1925. She was
   preceded in office by her late husband William B. Ross. Also elected on
   November 4 was Miriam A. Ferguson of Texas, succeeding her impeached
   husband James Edward Ferguson, but she was not sworn in until January
   21, 1925. The first female governor elected without being the wife or
   widow of a past state governor was Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut,
   elected in 1974 and sworn in on January 8, 1975.

   Connecticut and Arizona are the only two states to have elected female
   governors from both major parties. New Hampshire has also had female
   governors from two parties, but Republican Vesta M. Roy served only in
   the acting capacity for a short time. Arizona was the first state where
   a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different
   parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total
   of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as
   governor. Washington was the first state to have both a female governor
   and female U.S. Senators serving at the same time (Christine Gregoire;
   Patty Murray; Maria Cantwell, respectively). New Hampshire was the
   first and currently only state to have a female governor and entirely
   female Congressional delegation serving at the same time.

   Previously, there were a record nine women serving as chief executive
   of their states on two different occasions: first, between December 6,
   2006, when Sarah Palin was inaugurated as the first female governor of
   Alaska, and January 14, 2008, when Kathleen Blanco left office as
   governor of Louisiana; and second, between January 10, 2009, when
   Beverly Perdue was inaugurated as governor of North Carolina, and
   January 20, 2009, when Ruth Ann Minner retired as governor of Delaware.

Race and ethnicity[edit]

   Among the 50 current governors, 45 are non-Hispanic whites of European
   American background. The other 5 governors include one African-American
   (Deval Patrick of Massachusetts), two Hispanic-Americans (Susana
   Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada), and two Americans
   of Indian descent (Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Nikki Haley of South
   Carolina).

   Among the five U.S. territories, one Hispanic (Alejandro Garcia Padilla
   of Puerto Rico), one black (John de Jongh of the U.S. Virgin Islands),
   and three Pacific Islander Americans (Eloy Inos of the Northern Mariana
   Islands, Eddie Calvo of Guam and Lolo Letalu Matalasi Moliga of
   American Samoa) currently serve as governor.

Birthplace[edit]

   21 of the current state governors were born outside the state they are
   serving. State constitutions have varying requirements for the length
   of citizenship and residency of the governor but unlike the President,
   state governors do not need to be natural-born citizens. There is some
   ambiguity in some state constitutions if a governor must be a citizen
   or just a resident.

Physical Disability[edit]

   Two legally blind governors have served: Bob C. Riley, who was governor
   of Arkansas for eleven days in January 1975, and David Paterson, who
   was governor of New York from 2008 until 2010. Governor of New York
   Franklin D. Roosevelt was paraplegic; he later went on to become the
   first wheelchair-bound president.

Salary[edit]

   The average salary of a state governor in 2009 was $124,398. The
   highest salary currently being accepted is that of New York Governor
   Andrew Cuomo at $179,000. The lowest salary is that of Maine Governor
   Paul LePage at $70,000. Only four states (New York, New Jersey,
   Michigan, and Virginia) currently offer their governors a higher salary
   than the $174,000 paid to members of Congress. In many states, the
   governor is not the highest-paid state employee; most often, that
   distinction is held by the head football or men's basketball coach at a
   major state university. As of January 2013^[update], five football
   coaches at public institutions were earning over $4 million annually,
   with Nick Saban of the University of Alabama being the highest-paid at
   slightly over $5.3 million;^[4] in basketball, the University of
   Kentucky's John Calipari is the highest-paid at $5.2 million.^[5]

Gubernatorial election timeline schedule[edit]

   All states except Louisiana hold gubernatorial elections on the first
   Tuesday following the first Monday in November. The earliest possible
   date for the election is therefore November 2 (if that date falls on a
   Tuesday), and the latest possible date is November 8 (if November 1
   falls on a Tuesday). Louisiana holds its gubernatorial elections on the
   third Saturday of November, but the gubernatorial elections may get
   cancelled if one candidate wins the election outright (see primary
   section below).
     * Two states hold their gubernatorial elections every even numbered
       year. Recent years are 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.

          New Hampshire and Vermont

   The other 48 states hold gubernatorial elections every four years.
     * Thirty-four states and three territories hold their gubernatorial
       elections in even numbered years which are not divisible by four
       (i.e. concurrent with congressional, but not presidential
       elections). Recent years are 2002, 2006, and 2010.

          Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
          Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,
          Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
          Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
          Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
          Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming and Guam, Northern Mariana
          Islands and the Virgin Island.

     * Nine states and two territories hold their gubernatorial elections
       in years divisible by four (i.e. concurrent with presidential
       elections, although Puerto Rico does not have an election for
       President). Recent years are 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012.

          Delaware, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North
          Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and American Samoa,
          Puerto Rico.

     * Three states hold their gubernatorial elections in the year before
       a year divisible by four. Recent years are 2003, 2007, and 2011.

          Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi

     * Two states hold their gubernatorial elections in the year following
       a year divisible by four. Recent years are 2005, 2009, and 2013.

          New Jersey and Virginia

Gubernatorial primaries[edit]

   All states, except for California and Louisiana, hold primaries in
   which each political party holds a primary election, and the winner of
   the primary election moves on to compete in a general election. In
   California and Louisiana, all the candidates run in a blanket primary
   against each other. Regardless of political party, the top two
   candidates move on to the general election. In Louisiana, the general
   election is cancelled if one of the candidates receives more than 50%
   of the votes cast. In California, the top two vote getters proceed to
   the general election regardless of how many votes the top vote getter
   received in the primary, and write-in candidates are prohibited from
   competing in the general election.

Term limits[edit]

     * See Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits

Relationship with lieutenant governor[edit]

   The type of relationship between the governor and the lieutenant
   governor greatly varies by state. In some states the governor and
   lieutenant governor are completely independent of each other, while in
   others the governor gets to choose (prior to the election) who would be
   his/her lieutenant governor.
     * Five states do not have a lieutenant governor. In those states, a
       different constitutional officer assumes the office of the governor
       should there be a vacancy in the office. Those states are Arizona,
       Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Wyoming.

     * Eighteen states have separate elections for the governor and the
       lieutenant governor, which may lead to the governor and the
       lieutenant governor being from different parties. Those states are
       Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana,
       Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode
       Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.

     * Two states have the State Senate appoint the lieutenant governor,
       which may mean that the governor and the lieutenant governor are
       from different parties. Those states are Tennessee and West
       Virginia.

     * Eight states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together
       on the same ticket, but the governor does not get to choose his/her
       running mate. In those states, the winners of the governor
       primaries and the winners of the lieutenant governor primaries run
       together as joint tickets in the general election. The governor and
       lieutenant governor would therefore be from the same party, but may
       not necessarily be political allies. Those states are Alaska,
       Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, New
       Mexico, Connecticut, and Wisconsin.

     * Seventeen states have the governor and lieutenant governor run
       together on the same ticket similar to the President and Vice
       President of the United States. In those states, the governor gets
       to pick (prior to the elections) who would be the lieutenant
       governor. Those states are Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
       Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New
       Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Utah.
