   Penal labor in the United States is explicitly allowed by the 13th
   Amendment of the American Constitution in 1865 as it states that
   "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for
   a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist
   within the United States, or any place subject to their
   jurisdiction."^[1]^[2] Unconvicted detainees awaiting trial cannot be
   forced to participate in forced rehabilitative labor programs in prison
   as it violates the Thirteenth Amendment.

   Penal labor is sometimes used as a punishment in the U.S. military.^[3]

Convict lease[edit]

   Convicts leased to harvest timber, around 1915, Florida
   Main article: Convict lease

   The "convict lease" system became popular throughout the American South
   following the American Civil War and into the 20th century. Since the
   impoverished state governments could not afford penitentiaries, they
   leased out prisoners to work at private firms. According to Douglas A.
   Blackmon, because of the revenue received by local governments, they
   had incentives to arrest blacks; tens of thousands of African Americans
   were arbitrarily arrested and leased to coal mines, lumber camps,
   brickyards, railroads, quarries, and farm plantations.^[4] In Florida,
   convicts were often sent to work in lumber camps and turpentine
   factories.^[5] The state governments maximized profits by putting the
   responsibility on the lessee to provide food, clothing, shelter, and
   medical care for the prisoners, with little oversight. This resulted in
   extremely poor conditions, numerous deaths, and perhaps the most
   inhumane system of labor in the United States.^[6] Reformers abolished
   convict leasing in the 20th-century Progressive Era, stopping the
   system in Florida in 1919. The last state to abolish the practice was
   Alabama in 1927.^[citation needed]

Mississippi for-profit prison labor[edit]

   Main article: Private prisons in the United States

   Forced exists in many prisons. In Mississippi, Parchman Farm operated
   as a for-profit plantation, which yielded revenues for the state from
   its earliest years. Many prisoners were used to clear the dense growth
   in the Mississippi bottomland, and then to cultivate the land for
   agriculture. By the mid-20th century, it had 21,000 acres under
   cultivation. In the late 20th century, prison conditions were
   investigated under civil rights laws, when abuses of prisoners and
   harsh working conditions were exposed. These revelations during the
   1970s lead the state to abandon the for-profit aspect of its forced
   labor from convicts and planned to hire a professional penologist to
   head the prison. A state commission recommended reducing the size of
   acreage, to grow only what is needed for the prison.^[7]

Hired convict labor[edit]

   In 1934 federal prison officials concerned about growing unrest in
   prisons, lobbied to create a work program. Private companies got
   involved again in 1979, when Congress passed a law allowing them to
   hire prisoners in some circumstances.^[citation needed]

   According to the International Labor Organization, in 2000-2011 wages
   in American prisons ranged between $0.23 and $1.15 an hour. In
   California, prisoners earn between $0.30 and $0.95 an hour before
   deductions.^[8]

Governmental prison workforce authorities[edit]

   Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR or FPI) is a wholly owned United
   States government corporation created in 1934 that uses penal labor
   from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to produce goods and services.
   FPI is restricted to selling its products and services to federal
   government agencies,^[9] with some recent exceptions.

   California Prison Industry Authority is an entity within the California
   Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) that develops and
   operates industrial, agricultural, and service enterprises using penal
   labor.^[citation needed]
