   The United States Senate is a legislative chamber in the bicameral
   legislature of the United States of America, and together with the U.S.
   House of Representatives makes up the U.S. Congress. First convened in
   1789, the composition and powers of the Senate are established in
   Article One of the U.S. Constitution.^[1] Each U.S. state is
   represented by two senators, regardless of population, who serve
   staggered six-year terms. The chamber of the United States Senate is
   located in the north wing of the Capitol, in Washington, D.C., the
   national capital. The House of Representatives convenes in the south
   wing of the same building.

   The Senate has several exclusive powers not granted to the House,
   including consenting to treaties as a precondition to their
   ratification and consenting to or confirming appointments of Cabinet
   secretaries, federal judges, other federal executive officials,
   military officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, and other federal
   uniformed officers,^[2]^[3] as well as trial of federal officials
   impeached by the House. The Senate is widely considered to be both a
   more deliberative^[4] and more prestigious^[5]^[6]^[7] body than the
   House of Representatives, due to its longer terms, smaller size, and
   statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial
   and less partisan atmosphere.^[8]

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States Senate

   The framers of the Constitution created a bicameral Congress primarily
   as a compromise between those who felt that each state, since it was
   sovereign, should be equally represented, and those who felt the
   legislature must directly represent the people, as the House of Commons
   did in Britain. There was also a desire to have two Houses that could
   act as an internal check on each other. One was intended to be a
   "People's House" directly elected by the people, and with short terms
   obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents. The
   other was intended to represent the states to such extent as they
   retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to
   the national government. The Senate was thus not intended to represent
   the people of the United States equally. The Constitution provides that
   the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of
   legislation.^[9]

   The Senate of the United States was formed on the example of the
   ancient Roman Senate. The name is derived from the senatus, Latin for
   council of elders (from senex meaning old man in Latin).^[10]

   James Madison made the following comment about the Senate:

          In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes
          of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure.
          An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be
          just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of
          the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a
          share in the government, to support these invaluable interests,
          and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so
          constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against
          the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and
          to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and
          stability.^[11]

   The Constitution stipulates that no constitutional amendment may be
   created to deprive a state of its equal suffrage in the Senate without
   that state's consent. The District of Columbia and all other
   territories are not entitled to representation in either House of the
   Congress. The District of Columbia elects two shadow senators, but they
   are officials of the D.C. city government and not members of the U.S.
   Senate.^[12] The United States has had 50 states since 1959,^[13] thus
   the Senate has had 100 senators since 1959.^[14]

   The disparity between the most and least populous states has grown
   since the Connecticut Compromise, which granted each state two members
   of the Senate and at least one member of the House of Representatives,
   for a total minimum of three presidential Electors, regardless of
   population. In 1787, Virginia had roughly 10 times the population of
   Rhode Island, whereas today California has roughly 70 times the
   population of Wyoming, based on the 1790 and 2000 censuses. This means
   some citizens are effectively two orders of magnitude better
   represented in the Senate than those in other states. Seats in the
   House of Representatives are approximately proportionate to the
   population of each state, reducing the disparity of representation.

   ^[15]

   Before the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were
   elected by the individual state legislatures.^[16] However, problems
   with repeated vacant seats due to the inability of a legislature to
   elect senators, intrastate political struggles, and even bribery and
   intimidation gradually led to a growing movement to amend the
   Constitution to allow for the direct election of senators.^[17]

   Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for
   senators: 1) they must be at least 30 years old, 2) they must have been
   citizens of the United States for at least the past nine years, and 3)
   they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the
   time of their election. The age and citizenship qualifications for
   senators are more stringent than those for representatives. In
   Federalist No. 62, James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing
   that the "senatorial trust" called for a "greater extent of information
   and stability of character."

   The Senate (not the judiciary) is the sole judge of a senator's
   qualifications. During its early years, however, the Senate did not
   closely scrutinize the qualifications of its members. As a result,
   three senators who failed to meet the age qualification were
   nevertheless admitted to the Senate: Henry Clay (aged 29 in 1806),
   Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in
   1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since.^[18]
   In 1934, Rush D. Holt, Sr. was elected to the Senate at the age of 29;
   he waited until he turned 30 (on the following June 19) to take the
   oath of office. In November 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate
   at the age of 29, but he reached his 30th birthday before the
   swearing-in ceremony for incoming senators in January 1973.

   The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution disqualifies
   from the Senate any federal or state officers who had taken the
   requisite oath to support the Constitution, but later engaged in
   rebellion or aided the enemies of the United States. This provision,
   which came into force soon after the end of the Civil War, was intended
   to prevent those who had sided with the Confederacy from serving. That
   Amendment, however, also provides a method to remove that
   disqualification: a two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress.

Elections and term[edit]

   See also: List of current United States Senators and Elections in the
   United States

   Originally, senators were selected by the state legislatures, not by
   popular elections. By the early years of the 20th century, the
   legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election
   of senators by referendums.^[19] Popular election to the Senate was
   standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the Seventeenth
   Amendment.

Term[edit]

   Senators serve terms of six years each; the terms are staggered so that
   approximately one-third of the seats are up for election every two
   years. This was achieved by dividing the senators of the 1st Congress
   into thirds (called classes), where the terms of one-third expired
   after two years, the terms of another third expired after four, and the
   terms of the last third expired after six years. This arrangement was
   also followed after the admission of new states into the union. The
   staggering of terms has been arranged such that both seats from a given
   state are not contested in the same general election, except when a
   mid-term vacancy is being filled. Current senators whose six-year terms
   expire on January 3, 2015, belong to Class II.

   The Constitution set the date for Congress to convene—Article 1,
   Section 4, Clause 2 originally set that date for the third day of
   December. The Twentieth Amendment, however, changed the opening date
   for sessions to noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by
   law appoint a different day. The Twentieth Amendment also states that
   Congress shall assemble at least once in every year and allows Congress
   to determine its convening and adjournment dates and other dates and
   schedules as it desires. Article 1, Section 3 provides that the
   President has the power to convene Congress on extraordinary occasions
   at his discretion.

   A member who has been elected, but not yet seated, is called a
   "senator-elect"; a member who has been appointed to a seat, but not yet
   seated, is called a "senator-designate".

Elections[edit]

   Elections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first
   Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and coincide
   with elections for the House of Representatives.^[20] Senators are
   elected by their state as a whole. In most states (since 1970), a
   primary election is held first for the Republican and Democratic
   parties, with the general election following a few months later. Ballot
   access rules for independent and minor party candidates vary from state
   to state. The winner is the candidate who receives a plurality of the
   popular vote. In some states, runoffs are held if no candidate wins a
   majority.

Mid-term vacancies[edit]

   The Seventeenth Amendment requires mid-term vacancies in the Senate to
   be filled by special election. If a special election for one seat
   happens to coincide with a general election for the state's other seat,
   each seat is contested separately. A senator elected in a special
   election takes office as soon as possible after the election and serves
   until the original six-year term expires (i.e. not for a full term).

   The Seventeenth Amendment also allows state legislatures to give their
   governors the power to appoint temporary senators until the special
   election takes place. The official wording provides that "the
   legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make
   temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election
   as the legislature may direct."

   As of 2009, forty-six states permit their governors to make such
   appointments. In thirty-seven of these states, the special election to
   permanently fill the U.S. Senate seat is customarily held at the next
   biennial congressional election. The other nine states require that
   special elections be held outside of the normal two-year election cycle
   in some or all circumstances. In four states (Arizona, Hawaii, Utah,
   and Wyoming), the governor must appoint someone of the same political
   party as the previous incumbent.

   Oregon and Wisconsin require special elections for vacancies with no
   interim appointment, and Oklahoma permits the governor to appoint only
   the winner of a special election.^[21] In September 2009, Massachusetts
   changed its law to enable the governor to appoint a temporary
   replacement for the late Senator Kennedy until the special election in
   January 2010.^[22]^[23] In 2004, Alaska enacted legislation and a
   separate ballot referendum that took effect on the same day, but that
   conflicted with each other. The effect of the ballot-approved law is to
   withhold from the governor authority to appoint a senator.^[24] Because
   the 17th Amendment vests the power to grant that authority to the
   legislature – not the people or the state generally – it is unclear
   whether the ballot measure supplants the legislature's statute granting
   that authority.^[24] As a result, it is uncertain whether an Alaska
   governor may appoint an interim senator to serve until a special
   election is held to fill the vacancy.

   The temporary appointee may run in the special election in his or her
   own right.

   The Constitution requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to
   support the Constitution.^[25] Congress has prescribed the following
   oath for new senators:

     I, ___ ___, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and
     defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to
     the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental
     reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and
     faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to
     enter. So help me God.^[26]

Salary and benefits[edit]

   The annual salary of each senator, as of 2013, is $174,000;^[27] the
   president pro tempore and party leaders receive $193,400.^[27]^[28] In
   June 2003, at least 40 of the then-senators were millionaires.^[29]

   Along with earning salaries, senators receive retirement and health
   benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully
   vested after five years of service.^[28] Senators are covered by the
   Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement
   System (CSRS). As it is for federal employees, congressional retirement
   is funded through taxes and the participants' contributions. Under
   FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement
   plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. The amount
   of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average
   of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a
   senator's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary.
   In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and
   representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under
   FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.^[28]

Political prominence[edit]

   Senators are regarded as more prominent political figures than members
   of the House of Representatives because there are fewer of them, and
   because they serve for longer terms, usually represent larger
   constituencies (the exception being House at-large districts, which
   similarly comprise entire states), sit on more committees, and have
   more staffers. Far more senators have been nominees for the presidency
   than representatives. Furthermore, three senators (Warren Harding, John
   F. Kennedy, and Barack Obama) have been elected president while serving
   in the Senate, while only one Representative (James Garfield) has been
   elected president while serving in the House, though Garfield was also
   a Senator-elect at the time of his election to the Presidency, having
   been chosen by the Ohio Legislature to fill a Senate vacancy.

Seniority[edit]

   Main article: Seniority in the United States Senate

   According to the convention of Senate seniority, the senator with the
   longer tenure in each state is known as the "senior senator"; the other
   is the "junior senator". This convention does not have official
   significance, though it is a factor in the selection of physical
   offices.^[30] In the 113th Congress, the most-senior "junior senator"
   is Tom Harkin of Iowa, who was sworn in on January 3, 1985 and is
   currently 7th in seniority, behind Chuck Grassley who was sworn in on
   January 3, 1981 and is currently 6th in seniority. With the resignation
   of John Kerry, the most-junior "senior senator" is Elizabeth Warren of
   Massachusetts, who was sworn in January 3, 2013, and is currently 95th
   in seniority, ahead of senator Ed Markey who was sworn in July 16, 2013
   and is currently 98th in seniority.

Expulsion and other disciplinary actions[edit]

   The Senate may expel a senator by a two-thirds vote. Fifteen senators
   have been expelled in the history of the Senate: William Blount, for
   treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the
   Confederate secession. Although no senator has been expelled since
   1862, many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion
   proceedings – for example, Bob Packwood in 1995. The Senate has also
   censured and condemned senators; censure requires only a simple
   majority and does not remove a senator from office. Some senators have
   opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain
   censure or expulsion, such as Robert Torricelli in 2002.

Majority and minority parties[edit]

   The "Majority party" is the political party that either has a majority
   of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if
   two or more parties are tied, the vice president's affiliation
   determines which party is the majority party. The next-largest party is
   known as the minority party. The president pro tempore, committee
   chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party;
   they have counterparts (for instance, the "ranking members" of
   committees) in the minority party. Independents and members of third
   parties (so long as they do not caucus with or support either of the
   larger parties) are not considered in determining which is the majority
   party.

Seating[edit]

   The Democratic Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's
   right, and the Republican Party traditionally sits to the presiding
   officer's left, regardless which party has a majority of seats.^[31] In
   this respect, the Senate differs from the House of Commons of the
   United Kingdom and other parliamentary bodies in the Commonwealth of
   Nations and elsewhere.

   The Vice President of the United States presides over the Senate,^[1]
   but the party leaders have the real power and they control procedure.
   Many non-member officers are also hired to run the day-to-day functions
   of the Senate.

Presiding over the Senate[edit]

   The Vice President of the United States is the ex officio President of
   the Senate, with authority to preside over the Senate's sessions,
   although he can vote only to break a tie.^[1] For decades the task of
   presiding over Senate sessions was one of the vice president's
   principal duties. Since the 1950s, vice presidents have presided over
   few Senate debates. Instead, they have usually presided only on
   ceremonial occasions, such as joint sessions, or at times when a tie
   vote on an important issue is anticipated. The Constitution authorizes
   the Senate to elect a president pro tempore (Latin for "president for a
   time") to preside in the vice president's absence; the most senior
   senator of the majority party is customarily chosen to serve in this
   position.^[1] Like the vice president, the president pro tempore does
   not normally preside over the Senate, but typically delegates the
   responsibility of presiding to junior senators of the majority party,
   usually in blocks of one hour on a rotating basis. Frequently, freshmen
   senators (newly elected members) are asked to preside so that they may
   become accustomed to the rules and procedures of the body.

   The presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of the Senate
   chamber. The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less
   extensive than those of the Speaker of the House. The presiding officer
   calls on senators to speak (by the rules of the Senate, the first
   senator who rises is recognized); ruling on points of order (objections
   by senators that a rule has been breached, subject to appeal to the
   whole chamber); and announcing the results of votes.

Party leaders[edit]

   Each party elects Senate party leaders. Floor leaders act as the party
   chief spokespeople. The Senate Majority Leader is responsible for
   controlling the agenda of the chamber by scheduling debates and votes.
   Each party elects an assistant leader (whip) who works to ensure that
   their party's senators vote as the party leadership desires.

Non-member officers[edit]

   The Senate is served by several officials who are not members. The
   Senate's chief administrative officer is the Secretary of the Senate,
   who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the
   acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks. The
   Assistant Secretary of the Senate aids the secretary in his or her
   work. Another official is the Sergeant at Arms who, as the Senate's
   chief law enforcement officer, maintains order and security on the
   Senate premises. The Capitol Police handle routine police work, with
   the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight. Other
   employees include the Chaplain, who is elected by the Senate, and
   Pages, who are appointed.

Procedure[edit]

Daily sessions[edit]

   A typical Senate desk

   The Senate uses Standing Rules of the Senate for operation. Like the
   House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol
   in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais
   from which the presiding officer presides. The lower tier of the dais
   is used by clerks and other officials. One hundred desks are arranged
   in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide
   central aisle. By tradition, Republicans sit to the right of the center
   aisle and Democrats to the left, facing the presiding officer.^[32]
   Each senator chooses a desk based on seniority within the party. By
   custom, the leader of each party sits in the front row along the center
   aisle. Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or
   invocation and typically convene on weekdays. Sessions of the Senate
   are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television,
   usually by C-SPAN 2.

   Senate procedure depends not only on the rules, but also on a variety
   of customs and traditions. The Senate commonly waives some of its
   stricter rules by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent agreements are
   typically negotiated beforehand by party leaders. A senator may block
   such an agreement, but in practice, objections are rare. The presiding
   officer enforces the rules of the Senate, and may warn members who
   deviate from them. The presiding officer sometimes uses the gavel of
   the Senate to maintain order.

   A "hold" is placed when the leader's office is notified that a senator
   intends to object to a request for unanimous consent from the Senate to
   consider or pass a measure. A hold may be placed for any reason and can
   be lifted by a senator at any time. A senator may place a hold simply
   to review a bill, to negotiate changes to the bill, or to kill the
   bill. A bill can be held for as long as the senator who objects to the
   bill wishes to block its consideration.

   Holds can be overcome, but require time-consuming procedures such as
   filing cloture. Holds are considered private communications between a
   senator and the Leader, and are sometimes referred to as "secret
   holds". A senator may disclose that he or she has placed a hold.

   The Constitution provides that a majority of the Senate constitutes a
   quorum to do business. Under the rules and customs of the Senate, a
   quorum is always assumed present unless a quorum call explicitly
   demonstrates otherwise. A senator may request a quorum call by
   "suggesting the absence of a quorum"; a clerk then calls the roll of
   the Senate and notes which members are present. In practice, senators
   rarely request quorum calls to establish the presence of a quorum.
   Instead, quorum calls are generally used to temporarily delay
   proceedings; usually such delays are used while waiting for a senator
   to reach the floor to speak or to give leaders time to negotiate. Once
   the need for a delay has ended, a senator may request unanimous consent
   to rescind the quorum call.

Debate[edit]

   Debate, like most other matters governing the internal functioning of
   the Senate, is governed by internal rules adopted by the Senate. During
   debate, senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding
   officer, but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first
   senator who rises to speak. Thus, the presiding officer has little
   control over the course of debate. Customarily, the Majority Leader and
   Minority Leader are accorded priority during debates even if another
   senator rises first. All speeches must be addressed to the presiding
   officer, who is addressed as "Mr. President" or "Madam President", and
   not to another member; other Members must be referred to in the third
   person. In most cases, senators do not refer to each other by name, but
   by state or position, using forms such as "the senior senator from
   Virginia", "the gentlewoman from California", or "my distinguished
   friend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee". Senators address the
   Senate standing next to their desk.^[33]

   Apart from rules governing civility, there are few restrictions on the
   content of speeches; there is no requirement that speeches be germane
   to the matter before the Senate.

   The rules of the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two
   speeches on a motion or bill on the same legislative day. A legislative
   day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence,
   it does not necessarily coincide with the calendar day. The length of
   these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases,
   senators may speak for as long as they please. Often, the Senate adopts
   unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for
   example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute.
   However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.

Filibuster and cloture[edit]

   Main articles: Filibuster in the United States Senate and
   Reconciliation (United States Congress)

   The filibuster is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by
   prolonging debate indefinitely. A filibuster may entail long speeches,
   dilatory motions, and an extensive series of proposed amendments. The
   Senate may end a filibuster by invoking cloture. In most cases, cloture
   requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the
   matter before the Senate involves changing the rules of the body – this
   includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster – a two-thirds
   majority is required. In current practice, the threat of filibuster is
   more important than its use; almost any motion that does not have the
   support of three-fifths of the Senate effectively fails. This means
   that 41 senators, which could represent as little as 12.3% of the U.S.
   population, can make a filibuster happen. Historically, cloture has
   rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to
   obtain the required supermajority, so a bill that already has
   bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster. However,
   motions for cloture have increased significantly in recent years.

   If the Senate invokes cloture, debate does not end immediately;
   instead, it is limited to 2 additional hours unless increased by
   another three-fifths vote. The longest filibuster speech in the history
   of the Senate was delivered by Strom Thurmond, who spoke for over 24
   hours in an unsuccessful attempt to block the passage of the Civil
   Rights Act of 1957.^[34]

   Under certain circumstances, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974
   provides for a process called "reconciliation" by which Congress can
   pass bills related to the budget without those bills being subject to a
   filibuster. This is accomplished by limiting all Senate floor debate to
   20 hours.^[35]

Voting[edit]

   When debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote. The
   Senate often votes by voice vote. The presiding officer puts the
   question, and Members respond either "Yea" (in favor of the motion) or
   "Nay" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the
   result of the voice vote. A senator, however, may challenge the
   presiding officer's assessment and request a recorded vote. The request
   may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the senators
   present. In practice, however, senators second requests for recorded
   votes as a matter of courtesy. When a recorded vote is held, the clerk
   calls the roll of the Senate in alphabetical order; senators respond
   when their name is called. Senators who were not in the chamber when
   their name was called may still cast a vote so long as the voting
   remains open. The vote is closed at the discretion of the presiding
   officer, but must remain open for a minimum of 15 minutes. If the vote
   is tied, the vice president, if present, is entitled to cast a
   tie-breaking vote. If the vice president is not present, the motion
   fails.^[36]

   Bills which are filibustered require a three fifth majority to overcome
   the cloture vote (which usually means 60 votes) and get to the normal
   vote where a simple majority (usually 51 votes) will approve the bill.
   This has caused some news media to confuse the 60 votes needed to
   overcome a filibuster with the 51 votes needed to approve a bill, with
   for example USA Today erroneously stating "The vote was 58-39 in favor
   of the provision establishing concealed carry permit reciprocity in the
   48 states that have concealed weapons laws. That fell two votes short
   of the 60 needed to approve the measure".^[37]

Closed session[edit]

   Main article: Closed session of the United States Congress

   On occasion, the Senate may go into what is called a secret or closed
   session. During a closed session, the chamber doors are closed, cameras
   are turned off, and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not
   sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or
   not essential to the session. Closed sessions are rare and usually held
   only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as
   information critical to national security, private communications from
   the president, or deliberations during impeachment trials. A senator
   may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at
   least one other member, but an agreement usually occurs
   beforehand.^[38] If the Senate does not approve release of a secret
   transcript, the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security
   and ultimately sent to the national archives. The proceedings remain
   sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of
   secrecy.^[39]

Calendars[edit]

   The Senate maintains a Senate Calendar and an Executive Calendar.^[40]
   The former identifies bills and resolutions awaiting Senate floor
   actions. The latter identifies executive resolutions, treaties, and
   nominations reported out by Senate committee(s) and awaiting Senate
   floor action. Both are updated each day the Senate is in session.

Committees[edit]

   Dirksen Senate Office Building Committee Room 226 is used for hearings
   by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Main articles: U.S. Congressional committee and List of United States
   Senate committees

   The Senate uses committees (and their subcommittees) for a variety of
   purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the
   executive branch. Formally, the whole Senate appoints committee
   members. In practice, however, the choice of members is made by the
   political parties. Generally, each party honors the preferences of
   individual senators, giving priority based on seniority. Each party is
   allocated seats on committees in proportion to its overall strength.

   Most committee work is performed by 16 standing committees, each of
   which has jurisdiction over a field such as finance or foreign
   relations. Each standing committee may consider, amend, and report
   bills that fall under its jurisdiction. Furthermore, each standing
   committee considers presidential nominations to offices related to its
   jurisdiction. (For instance, the Judiciary Committee considers nominees
   for judgeships, and the Foreign Relations Committee considers nominees
   for positions in the Department of State.) Committees may block
   nominees and impede bills from reaching the floor of the Senate.
   Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the
   executive branch. In discharging their duties, standing committees have
   the power to hold hearings and to subpoena witnesses and evidence.

   The Senate also has several committees that are not considered standing
   committees. Such bodies are generally known as select or special
   committees; examples include the Select Committee on Ethics and the
   Special Committee on Aging. Legislation is referred to some of these
   committees, although the bulk of legislative work is performed by the
   standing committees. Committees may be established on an ad hoc basis
   for specific purposes; for instance, the Senate Watergate Committee was
   a special committee created to investigate the Watergate scandal. Such
   temporary committees cease to exist after fulfilling their tasks.

   The Congress includes joint committees, which include members from both
   the Senate and the House of Representatives. Some joint committees
   oversee independent government bodies; for instance, the Joint
   Committee on the Library oversees the Library of Congress. Other joint
   committees serve to make advisory reports; for example, there exists a
   Joint Committee on Taxation. Bills and nominees are not referred to
   joint committees. Hence, the power of joint committees is considerably
   lower than those of standing committees.

   Each Senate committee and subcommittee is led by a chair (usually a
   member of the majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were
   determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators
   continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even
   senility.^[41] Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice,
   seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: they
   control the committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to
   devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the
   committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the
   president; they manage on the floor of the full Senate the
   consideration of those bills the committee reports. This last role was
   particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were
   thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence:
   senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to
   accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate
   rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in
   the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more
   moderate and collegial in exercising it, than they were before
   reform.^[42] The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the
   committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking
   member.^[43] In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select
   Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as
   the vice chair.

   Recent criticisms of the Senate's operations object to what the critics
   argue is obsolescence as a result of partisan paralysis and a
   preponderance of arcane rules.^[44]^[45]

Functions[edit]

Legislation[edit]

   Further information: Act of Congress

   Bills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress. However, the
   Constitution's Origination Clause provides that "All bills for raising
   Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives".^[46] As a
   result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing
   taxes. Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate
   does not have the power to originate appropriation bills, or bills
   authorizing the expenditure of federal funds.^[47]^[48]^[49]
   Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by
   the House. However, when the Senate originates an appropriations bill,
   the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute
   in practice.^[citation needed] The constitutional provision barring the
   Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the
   British Parliament, in which only the House of Commons may originate
   such measures.^[50]

   Although the Constitution gave the House the power to initiate revenue
   bills, in practice the Senate is equal to the House in the respect of
   spending. As Woodrow Wilson wrote:^[51]
   “ The Senate's right to amend general appropriation bills has been
     allowed the widest possible scope. The upper house may add to them what
     it pleases; may go altogether outside of their original provisions and
     tack to them entirely new features of legislation, altering not only
     the amounts but even the objects of expenditure, and making out of the
     materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost
     totally new character.                                                 ”

   The approval of both houses is required for any bill, including a
   revenue bill, to become law. Both Houses must pass the same version of
   the bill; if there are differences, they may be resolved by sending
   amendments back and forth or by a conference committee, which includes
   members of both bodies.

Checks and balances[edit]

   The Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that
   form its ability to "check and balance" the powers of other elements of
   the Federal Government. These include the requirement that the Senate
   may advise and must consent to some of the president's government
   appointments; also the Senate must consent to all treaties with foreign
   governments; it tries all impeachments, and it elects the vice
   president in the event no person gets a majority of the electoral
   votes.
   The Senate has the power to try impeachments; shown above is Theodore
   R. Davis's drawing of the impeachment trial of President Andrew
   Johnson, 1868.

   The president can make certain appointments only with the advice and
   consent of the Senate. Officials whose appointments require the
   Senate's approval include members of the Cabinet, heads of most federal
   executive agencies, ambassadors, Justices of the Supreme Court, and
   other federal judges. Under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution,
   a large number of government appointments are subject to potential
   confirmation; however, Congress has passed legislation to authorize the
   appointment of many officials without the Senate's consent (usually,
   confirmation requirements are reserved for those officials with the
   most significant final decision-making authority). Typically, a nominee
   is first subject to a hearing before a Senate committee. Thereafter,
   the nomination is considered by the full Senate. The majority of
   nominees are confirmed, but in a small number of cases each year,
   Senate Committees will purposely fail to act on a nomination to block
   it. In addition, the president sometimes withdraws nominations when
   they appear unlikely to be confirmed. Because of this, outright
   rejections of nominees on the Senate floor are infrequent (there have
   been only nine Cabinet nominees rejected outright in the history of the
   United States).^[citation needed]

   The powers of the Senate concerning nominations are, however, subject
   to some constraints. For instance, the Constitution provides that the
   president may make an appointment during a congressional recess without
   the Senate's advice and consent. The recess appointment remains valid
   only temporarily; the office becomes vacant again at the end of the
   next congressional session. Nevertheless, presidents have frequently
   used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate
   may reject the nominee. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held in Myers
   v. United States, although the Senate's advice and consent is required
   for the appointment of certain executive branch officials, it is not
   necessary for their removal.^[52]
   U.S. Senate chamber c. 1873

   The Senate also has a role in ratifying treaties. The Constitution
   provides that the president may only "make Treaties, provided two
   thirds of the Senators present concur." However, not all international
   agreements are considered treaties under US domestic law, even if they
   are considered treaties under international law. Congress has passed
   laws authorizing the president to conclude executive agreements without
   action by the Senate. Similarly, the president may make
   congressional-executive agreements with the approval of a simple
   majority in each House of Congress, rather than a two-thirds majority
   in the Senate. Neither executive agreements nor congressional-executive
   agreements are mentioned in the Constitution, leading some scholars
   such as Laurence Tribe and John Yoo^[53] to suggest that they
   unconstitutionally circumvent the treaty-ratification process. However,
   courts have upheld the validity of such agreements.^[54]

   The Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to impeach
   federal officials for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and
   Misdemeanors" and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments. If the
   sitting President of the United States is being tried, the Chief
   Justice of the United States presides over the trial. During an
   impeachment trial, senators are constitutionally required to sit on
   oath or affirmation. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority of the
   senators present. A convicted official is automatically removed from
   office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be
   banned from holding office. No further punishment is permitted during
   the impeachment proceedings; however, the party may face criminal
   penalties in a normal court of law.

   In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has
   impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. (One
   resigned before the Senate could complete the trial.)^[55] Only two
   presidents of the United States have ever been impeached: Andrew
   Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both trials ended in
   acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the
   two-thirds majority required for conviction.

   Under the Twelfth Amendment, the Senate has the power to elect the vice
   president if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of
   votes in the Electoral College. The Twelfth Amendment requires the
   Senate to choose from the two candidates with the highest numbers of
   electoral votes. Electoral College deadlocks are rare. In the history
   of the United States, the Senate has only broken a deadlock once. In
   1837, it elected Richard Mentor Johnson. The House elects the president
   if the Electoral College deadlocks on that choice.
