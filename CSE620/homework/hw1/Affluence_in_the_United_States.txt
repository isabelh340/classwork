   Affluence in the United States refers to an individual's or household's
   state of being in an economically favorable position in contrast to a
   given reference group.^[3] While there are no precise guidelines or
   thresholds for what may be considered affluent, the United States
   Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census does provide detailed
   statistical data on the economic state of America's population.

   Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become
   rich may have had a "substantial head start".^[4]^[5] In September
   2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, "over 60 percent"
   of the Forbes richest 400 Americans "grew up in substantial
   privilege".^[6]

   Income, measured either by household or individual, is perhaps the most
   commonly used measure for whether or not a given entity may be
   considered affluent. The term's usage varies greatly depending on
   context and speaker. Both an upper middle class person with a personal
   income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may be referred to as
   affluent. If the average American with a median income of roughly
   $32,000^[7] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the ages of
   25 and 64)^[8] was used as a reference group, the upper middle class
   person with a personal income in the tenth percentile of $77,500 may
   indeed be referred to as affluent.^[7] If compared to an executive of
   the Fortune 500, however, the upper middle class person would be
   poor.^[9]^[10]

   Currently, marketing corporations and investment houses classify those
   with household incomes exceeding $75,000 as mass affluent, while
   sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies all those with a net worth of
   $1 million or more as "rich." The upper class is most commonly defined
   as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $525,000
   annually, as of 2013. These two figures should be seen only as
   guidelines based upon the top 1% of a population because net worth
   exceeding $1 million may be increasingly inaccurate as an upper class
   indicator as the value of the dollar falls due to inflation.
   Nonetheless, according to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the
   "richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the
   bottom 90 percent".^[11]

   The U.S. Census Bureau offers income data by household and individual.
   42% of households have two income earners; thus making households'
   income levels higher than personal income levels.^[12] The 2005
   economic survey revealed the income distribution for households and
   individuals whereby the top 5% of individuals had six figure incomes
   (exceeding $100,000) and the top 10% of individuals had incomes
   exceeding $75,000.^[7] The top 5% of households, three quarters of whom
   had two income earners, had incomes of $166,200 (about 10 times the
   2009 minimum wage in the US) or more,^[12] with the top 10% having
   incomes well in excess of $100,000.^[13] The top 1.5% of households had
   incomes exceeding $250,000 with 146,000 households, the top 0.12%,
   having incomes exceeding $1,600,000 annually.^[14]

   Households may also be differentiated among each other, depending on
   whether or not they have one or multiple income earners. The high
   female participation in the economy means that many households have two
   working members.^[15] In 2005 for example, the median households income
   for a two income earner households was $67,000. The median income for
   an individual employed full-time with a graduate degree was in excess
   of $60,000, concluding that nearly half of those with graduate degree
   are able to out-earn most dual income households with one-income.^[8]

   The average home in the United States has more than 700 square feet per
   person, which is 50% - 100% more than in other high-income countries.
   Even in the lowest income percentiles people enjoy more space than
   middle classes in Europe. Likewise even in the lowest percentiles
   ownership rates of gadgets and amenities are exceptionally high
   compared to other countries.^[16]^[17] The labor market in the United
   States has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net
   migration rate is among the highest in the world.

   Overall the term affluent may be applied to a variety of individuals,
   households or other entities depending on context. Data from the U.S.
   Census Bureau serves as the main guideline for defining affluence. U.S.
   government data not only reveals the nation's income distribution but
   also provides data regarding the demographic characteristics of those
   to whom the term, affluent, may be applied.^[12]

   Affluence and economic standing within society often are expressed in
   terms of percentile ranking. Economic ranking is conducted either in
   terms of giving lower thresholds for a designated group (e.g. the top
   5%, 10%, 15%, etc.) or in terms of the percentage of
   households/individuals with incomes above a certain thresholds (e.g.
   above $75,000, $100,000, $150,000, etc.). The table below presents 2006
   income data in terms of the lower thresholds for the given percentages
   (e.g. the top 25.6% of households had incomes exceeding $80,000,
   compared to $47,000 for the top quarter of individuals).^[7]^[13]

Over time[edit]

   This graph shows the income of the given percentiles from 1967 to 2003,
   in 2003 dollars.^[18]
   This graph shows the income of the given percentiles from 1947 to 2007,
   in 2007 dollars.^[19]

   Household income changes over the course of time, with income gains
   being substantially larger for the upper, than for the lower,
   percentiles.^[20] All areas of the income strata saw their incomes rise
   since the late 1960s, especially during the late 1990s.^[18]

   The overall increase in household income is largely the result of an
   increased percentage of households with more than one income earner.
   While households with just one income earner, most commonly the male,
   were the norm in the middle of the 20th century, 42% of all households
   and the vast majority of married couple households now have two or more
   income earners. With so many present day households having two income
   earners, a substantial increase in household income is easy to
   explain.^[15]

     "The typical middle-class household in the United States is no
     longer a one-earner family, with one parent in the workforce and one
     at home full-time. Instead, the majority of families with small
     children now have both parents rising at dawn to commute to jobs so
     they can both pull in paychecks... Today the median income for a
     fully employed male is $41,670 per year (all numbers are
     inflation-adjusted to 2004 dollars)—nearly $800 less than his
     counterpart of a generation ago. The only real increase in wages for
     a family has come from the second paycheck earned by a working
     mother." – Elizabeth Warren, Harvard Magazine.^[15]

   Two income earner households are far more common among the top quintile
   of households than the general population. 2006 U.S. Census Bureau data
   indicates that over three quarters, 76%, of households in the top
   quintile, with annual incomes exceeding $91,200, had two or more income
   earners compared to just 42% among the general population and a small
   minority in the bottom three quintiles. As a result much of the rising
   income inequity between the upper and lower percentiles can be
   explained through the increasing percentage of households with two or
   more incomes.^[15]^[20]

Professions[edit]

   Median annual earnings of selected professions as well as the national
   median income of full-time, year-round employed workers, according to
   the U.S. Department of Labor.

   The vast majority of Americans derive the majority of their income from
   occupational earnings.^[21] Income derived from an occupation is
   largely determined by scarcity and the economic law of supply and
   demand. The more demand for a certain specialty and the less supply,
   the higher the income. There has been shown to be a correlation between
   increases in income and increases in worker satisfaction. The decrease
   in worker dissatisfaction, however, is not solely a result of the
   increase in income. Workers in more complex and higher level
   occupations tend to have attained higher levels of education and thus
   are more likely to have a greater degree of autonomy in the
   workplace.^[21]

   Additionally higher level workers with advanced degrees are hired to
   share their personal knowledge, to conceptualize, and to consult.
   Higher-level workers suffer less job alienation and reap not only
   external benefits in terms of income from their jobs, but also enjoy
   high levels of intrinsic motivation and satisfaction.^[10]^[21]

   In the United States the highest earning occupational group is white
   collar professionals. Individuals in this occupational classification
   tend to experience the highest job satisfaction and highest incomes.
   Defining income based on title of a profession is fairly inaccurate,
   given that a professional title may indicate the type of education
   received, but does not always correlate with the actual day to day
   income producing endeavors that are pursued. Some sources cite the
   profession of physician in the United States as the highest
   paying,^[10]

   Physician (M.D. and D.O.) compensation ranks as the highest median
   annual earnings of any profession. Median annual earnings ranged from
   $156,010 for family physicians to $321,686 for anesthesiologists.
   Surgeons post a median annual income of $282,504.^[22] However, the
   annual salary for Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) is projected quite
   differently based on source: Salary.com reports a median salary of
   $634,941,^[23] while the U.S. Department of Labor in May 2004 reported
   the median as $140,350.^[24] This is primarily due to a methodological
   difference in terms of which companies were surveyed.^[citation needed]
   Overall annual earnings among the nation's top 25 professions ranged
   from the $70,000s to the $300,000s. In addition to physicians, lawyers,
   physicists, and nuclear engineers were all among the nation's 20
   highest paid occupations with incomes in excess of $78,410.^[25]

   Some of the other occupations in the high five-figure range were
   economists with a median of $72,780,^[26] mathematicians with
   $81,240,^[27] financial managers with $81,880,^[28] and software
   publishers with median annual earnings of $73,060.^[29] Median annual
   of wage-and-salary pharmacists in May 2006 were $94,520. Median annual
   of wage-and-salary engineers in November 2011 were $90,000. The middle
   50 percent earned between $83,180 and $108,140 a year (as in the
   Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–09 Edition by the U.S. Bureau of
   Labor Statistics).

Education[edit]

   Further information: Educational attainment in the United States
   Median household and personal income by educational attainment.

   Educational attainment plays a major factor in determining an
   individual's economic disposition. Personal income varied greatly
   according to an individual's education, as did household income.
   Incomes for those employed, full-time, year-round and over the age of
   twenty-five ranged from $20,826 ($17,422 if including those who worked
   part-time^[7]) for those with less than a ninth grade education to
   $100,000 for those with professional degrees ($82,473 if including
   those who work part-time^[7]).

   This median income for individuals with doctorates was $79,401 ($70,853
   if including those who work part-time^[7]).^[30] These statistics
   reveal that the majority of those employed full-time with professional
   or doctoral degrees are among the overall top 10% (15% if including
   those who work part-time) of income earners. Of those with a master's
   degree, nearly 50% were among the top quarter of income earners (top
   third if including those who work part-time).^[7]

Race[edit]

   Percent of households with six figure incomes and individuals with
   incomes in the top 10%, exceeding $77,500.
   Racial breakdown of households making over $100,000 per year.

   Recent U.S. Census Bureau publications indicate a strong correlation
   between race and affluence. In the top household income quintile,
   households with incomes exceeding $91,200, Asian Americans and Whites
   were overrepresented, whereas Hispanics and African Americans were
   underrepresented. The household income for Asian Americans was, at
   $61,094, by far the highest,^[31] exceeding that of Whites ($48,554) by
   26%.^[32] Over a quarter, 27.5%, of Asian American households had
   incomes exceeding $100,000, and another 40% had incomes of over
   $75,000.^[33]

   Among White households, who remained near the national median, 18.3%
   had six figure incomes, while 28.9% had incomes exceeding $75,000.^[32]
   The percentages of households with incomes exceeding $100,000 and
   $75,000 were far below the national medians for Hispanic and African
   American households.^[34] Among Hispanic households, for example, only
   9% had six figure incomes, and 17% had incomes exceeding $75,000.^[35]
   The race gap remained when considering personal income. In 2005,
   roughly 11% of Asian Americans^[36] and 7% of White individuals^[37]
   had six figure incomes, compared to 2.6% among Hispanics^[38] and 2.3%
   among African Americans.^[39]

   The racial breakdowns of income brackets further illustrate the racial
   disparities associated with affluence. in 2005, 81.8% of all 114
   million households were White (including White Hispanics),^[32] 12.2%
   were African American,^[34] 10.9% were Hispanic^[35] and 3.7% were
   Asian American.^[31]^[40] While White households are always near the
   national median due to Whites being the by far most prevalent racial
   demographic, the percentages of minority households with incomes
   exceeding $100,000 strayed considerably from their percentage of the
   overall population. Asian Americans, who represent the smallest
   surveyed racial demographic in the overall population, were the found
   to be the prevalent minority among six figure income households. Among
   the nearly twenty million households with six figure incomes, 86.9%
   were White,^[32] 5.9% were Asian American,^[31] 5.6% were Hispanic^[35]
   and 5.5% were African American.^[34] Among the general individual
   population with earnings, 82.1% were White,^[37] 12.7% were
   Hispanic,^[38] 11.0% were African American^[39] and 4.6% were Asian
   American.^[36]

   Of the top 10% of income earners, those nearly 15 million individuals
   with incomes exceeding $77,500, Whites and Asians were once again
   over-represented with the percentages of African Americans and
   Hispanics trailing behind considerably. Of the top 10% of earners,
   86.7% were White.^[37] Asian Americans were the prevalent minority,
   constituting 6.8% of top 10% income earners, nearly twice the
   percentage of Asian Americans among the general population.^[36]
   Hispanics, who were the prevalent minority in the general population of
   income earners, constituted only 5.2% of those in the top 10%,^[38]
   with African Americans being the least represented with 5.1%.^[39]

   Economic well-being is often associated with high societal status, yet
   income and economic compensation are a function of scarcity and act as
   only one of a number of indicators of social class. It is in the
   interest of all of society that open positions are adequately filled
   with a competent occupant enticed to do his or her best.^[10] As a
   result, an occupation that requires a scarce skill, the attainment of
   which is often documented through an educational degree, and entrusts
   its occupant with a high degree of influence will generally offer high
   economic compensation. The high income is meant to ensure that the
   desired individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g. medical or
   graduate school) and complete their tasks with the necessary
   valor.^[42]

   Differences in income may, however, be found among occupations of
   similar sociological nature. The median annual earnings of a physician
   were in excess of $150,000 in May 2004, compared to $95,000 for an
   attorney.^[22]^[25] Both occupations require finely tuned and scarce
   skill sets and both are essential to the well-being of society. Yet,
   physicians out-earned attorneys and other upper middle class
   professionals by a wide margin as their skill-sets are deemed
   especially scarce. Overall, high status positions tend to be those
   requiring a scarce skill and are therefore commonly far better
   compensated than those in the middle of the occupational
   strata.^[10]^[42]

     ...It is essential that the duties of the positions be performed
     with the diligence that their importance requires. Inevitably, then,
     a society must have, first, some kind of rewards that it can use as
     inducements, and, second, some way of distributing these rewards
     differently according to positions. The rewards and their
     distribution become part of the social order... If the rights and
     prequisites of different positions in a society must be unequal,
     then society must be stratified... Hence every society... must
     differentiate persons... and must therefore possess a certain amount
     of institutionalized inequality.

   —Kingsley Davis & Wilbert E. Moore, "Some Principles of
   Stratification", republished in Social Class and Stratification^[42]

   It is important to note that the above is an ideal type, a simplified
   model or reality using optimal circumstances. In reality other factors
   such as discrimination based on race, ethnicity and gender as well as
   aggressive political lobbying by certain professional organizations
   also influence personal income. An individual's personal career
   decisions as well as his or her personal connections within the
   nation's economic institutions are also likely to have an effect on
   income, status and whether or not an individual may be referred to as
   affluent.^[9]

   In contemporary America it is a combination of all these factors, with
   scarcity remaining by far the most prominent one, determine a person's
   economic compensation. Due to higher status professions requiring
   advanced and thus less commonly found skill sets (including the ability
   to supervise and work with a considerable autonomy) are better
   compensated through the means of income, making high status individuals
   affluent, depending on reference group.^[10]

   While the two paragraphs above only describe the relationship between
   status and personal income, household income is also often used to
   infer status. As a result, the dual income phenomenon presents yet
   another problem in equating affluence with high societal status. As
   mentioned earlier in the article 42% of households have two or more
   income earners, 76% of households with six figure incomes have two or
   more income earners.^[12] Furthermore people are most likely to marry
   their professional and societal equals. It therefore becomes apparent
   that the majority of households with incomes exceeding the six figure
   mark are the result of an economic as well as personal union between
   two economic equals. Today, two nurses, each making $55,000 a year, can
   easily outearn a single attorney who makes the median of $95,000
   annually.^[25]^[43] Despite household income rising drastically through
   the union of two economic equals, neither individual has advanced his
   or her function and position within society. Yet the household (not
   individual) may have become more affluent, assuming an increase in
   household members does not off-set the dual-income derived gains.

Extreme affluence[edit]

   The wide income discrepancies within the top 1.5% of households.
   See also: American billionaires, Poverty in the United States, and
   Wealth gap

   As of 2002, there were approximately 146,000 (0.1%) households with
   incomes exceeding $1,500,000, while the top 0.01% or 11,000 households
   had incomes exceeding $5,500,000. The 400 highest tax payers in the
   nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding $87,000,000.
   Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for
   any other. As a result, the gap between those who make less than one
   and half million dollars annually (99.9% of households) and those who
   make more (0.1%) has been steadily increasing, prompting The New York
   Times to proclaim that the "Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far
   Behind."^[44]

   The income disparities within the top 1.5% are quite drastic. While
   households in the top 1.5% of households had incomes exceeding
   $250,000, 443% above the national median, their incomes were still
   2200% lower than those of the top 0.01% of households. One can
   therefore conclude that almost any household, even those with incomes
   of $250,000 annually, are poor when compared to the top 0.1%, who in
   turn are poor compared to the top 0.000267%, the top 400 taxpaying
   households.^[citation needed]^[neutrality is disputed]^[original
