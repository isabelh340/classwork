Changes in membership[edit]

   There were no political parties in this Congress. Members are
   informally grouped into factions of similar interest, based on an
   analysis of their voting record.^[2]

   New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island, were the last states to
   ratify the U.S. Constitution, and because of their late ratification,
   were unable to send full representation at the beginning of this
   Congress. Five Senators and nine Representatives were subsequently
   seated from these states during the sessions as noted.

Senate[edit]
