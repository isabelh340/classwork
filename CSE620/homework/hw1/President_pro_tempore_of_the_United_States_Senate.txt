   The President pro tempore (/ˌproʊ ˈtɛmpəriː/ or /ˌproʊ ˈtɛmpəreɪ/),^[1]
   also president pro tem, is the second-highest-ranking official of the
   United States Senate. The United States Constitution states that the
   Vice President of the United States is the President of the Senate,
   despite not being a senator, and that the Senate must choose a
   president pro tempore. Since 1890, the most senior senator in the
   majority party has generally been chosen to be president pro tempore;
   this tradition has been observed without interruption since 1949.^[2]

   During the Vice President's absence, the president pro tempore is
   empowered to preside over Senate sessions. In practice, neither the
   Vice President nor the President pro tempore usually presides; instead,
   the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior senators of the
   majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure.^[3]

   The president pro tempore is third in the line of succession to the
   presidency, after the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of
   Representatives.^[4]

   Following the death of Daniel Inouye on December 17, 2012, Patrick
   Leahy, a Democrat and senior senator from Vermont, was elected to the
   position by unanimous consent.^[5]

Power and responsibilities[edit]

   The office of president pro tempore is created by Article I, Section 3
   of the Constitution:^[6]
   “ The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President
     pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall
     exercise the Office of President of the United States.              ”

   Although the position is in some ways equivalent to the Speaker of the
   House of Representatives, the powers of the president pro tempore are
   far more limited. In the Senate, most power rests with party leaders
   and individual senators, but as the chamber's presiding officer, the
   president pro tempore is authorized to perform certain duties in the
   absence of the Vice President, including ruling on points of order.^[7]
   Additionally, under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the
   president pro tempore and the speaker are the two authorities to whom
   declarations must be transmitted that the president is unable to
   perform the duties of the office, or is able to resume doing so. The
   president pro tempore is third in the line of presidential succession,
   following the vice president and the speaker.^[4]^[7] Additional duties
   include appointment of various congressional officers, certain
   commissions, advisory boards, and committees and joint supervision of
   the congressional page school.^[7] The president pro tempore is the
   designated legal recipient of various reports to the Senate, including
   War Powers Act reports under which he or she, jointly with the speaker,
   may have the president call Congress back into session. The
   officeholder is an ex officio member of various boards and commissions.
   With the secretary and sergeant at arms, the president pro tempore
   maintains order in Senate portions of the Capitol and Senate
   buildings.^[7]^[8]

History[edit]

   Benjamin Wade came within one vote of being the first president pro
   tempore to succeed to the presidency after the impeachment trial of
   Andrew Johnson in 1868.

   The office of president pro tempore was established by the Constitution
   of the United States in 1789. The first president pro tempore, John
   Langdon, was elected on April 6 the same year.^[7] Originally, the
   president pro tempore was appointed on an intermittent basis when the
   vice president was not present to preside over the Senate. Until the
   1960s, it was common practice for the vice president to preside over
   daily Senate sessions, so the president pro tempore rarely presided
   unless the vice presidency became vacant.^[9]

   Until 1891, the president pro tempore only served until the return of
   the vice president to the chair or the adjournment of a session of
   Congress. Between 1792 and 1886, the president pro tempore was second
   in the line of presidential succession following the vice president and
   preceding the speaker.^[9]

   When President Andrew Johnson, who had no vice president, was impeached
   and tried in 1868, Senate President pro tempore Benjamin Franklin Wade
   was next in line to the presidency. Wade's radicalism is thought by
   many historians to be a major reason why the Senate, which did not want
   to see Wade in the White House, acquitted Johnson.^[10] The president
   pro tempore and the speaker were removed from the line of succession in
   1886, but were restored in 1947. This time however the president pro
   tempore followed the speaker.^[7]

   Following the resignation (for health reasons) of President pro tempore
   William P. Frye, a Senate divided among progressive Republicans,
   conservative Republicans, and Democrats reached a compromise by which
   each of their candidates would rotate holding the office from 1911 to
   1913 (see below, #1911 – present).^[7]

   Only three former presidents pro tempore ever became vice president:
   John Tyler, William R. King and Charles Curtis. Tyler is also the only
   one to have become president, when he succeeded William Henry Harrison
   in 1841.

Related officials[edit]

Acting president pro tempore[edit]

   While the president pro tempore does have other official duties, the
   holders of the office have, like the vice president, over time ceased
   presiding over the Senate on a daily basis, owing to the mundane and
   ceremonial nature of the position.^[9] Furthermore, as the president
   pro tempore is now usually the most senior senator of the majority
   party, he or she most likely also chairs a major Senate committee and
   has other significant demands on his or her time. Therefore, the
   president pro tempore has less time now than in the past to preside
   daily over the Senate. Instead, junior senators from the majority party
   are designated acting president pro tempore to preside over the
   Senate.^[11] This allows junior senators to learn proper parliamentary
   procedure.^[3]

Permanent Acting President pro tempore[edit]

   In June 1963, because of the illness of president pro tempore Carl
   Hayden, Senator Lee Metcalf was designated permanent acting president
   pro tempore. No term was imposed on this designation, so Metcalf
   retained it until he died in office in 1978.^[8]

Deputy President pro tempore[edit]

   Hubert Humphrey (D-Minnesota) was the first Deputy President pro
   tempore in 1977–1978

   The ceremonial post of Deputy President pro tempore was created for
   Hubert Humphrey, a former vice president, in 1977 following his losing
   bid to become the Senate majority leader.^[12] The Senate resolution
   creating the position stated that any former president or former vice
   president serving in the Senate would be entitled to this position,
   though none has served since Humphrey's death in 1978,^[8] and former
   vice president Walter Mondale, who sought his former senate seat in
   Minnesota in 2002, is the only one to have tried. Andrew Johnson is the
   only former president to have subsequently served in the Senate.

   George J. Mitchell was elected deputy president pro tempore in 1987,
   because of the illness of president pro tempore John C. Stennis,
   similar to Metcalf's earlier designation as Permanent Acting President
   pro tempore. The office has remained vacant since 1988, and no senator
   other than Humphrey and Mitchell has held it since its creation.^[8]

   The post is largely honorary and ceremonial, but comes with a salary
   increase. By statute, the compensation granted to the position holder
   equals the rate of annual compensation paid to the president pro
   tempore, majority leader, and minority leader. (See 2
   U.S.C. § 32a.)^[8]

President pro tempore emeritus[edit]

   Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), former president pro tempore, and most recent
   president pro tempore emeritus.

   Since 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has
   been given to a Senator of the minority party who has previously served
   as president pro tempore. The position has been held by Strom Thurmond
   (R-South Carolina) (2001-2003), Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia)
   (2003-2007), and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) (2007-2009). The position was
   created for Thurmond when the Democratic Party regained a majority in
   the Senate in June 2001.^[13] With the change in party control,
   Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia replaced Thurmond as president
   pro tempore, reclaiming a position he had previously held from 1989 to
   1995 and briefly in January 2001. Thurmond's retirement from the Senate
   on January 3, 2003, coincided with a change from Democratic to
   Republican control, making Stevens president pro tempore and Byrd the
   second president pro tempore emeritus. Byrd returned as president pro
   tempore, and Stevens became the third president pro tempore emeritus,
   when the Democrats gained control of the Senate in 2007.^[8] While a
   president pro tempore emeritus has no official duties, he is entitled
   to an increase in staff^[14] and advises party leaders on the functions
   of the Senate.

Salary[edit]

   The salary of the president pro tempore for 2012 was $193,400, equal to
   that of the majority leaders and minority leaders of both houses of
   Congress. If there is a vacancy in the office of vice president, then
   the salary would be the same as that of the vice president,
   $221,000.^[8]

1911 – present[edit]

   From August 14, 1911 to March 3, 1913, the office of President pro
   tempore of the United States Senate for the 62nd Congress rotated among
   five individuals. The sitting Senate President pro tempore William P.
   Frye resigned due to ill health on April 27, 1911. The Senate at that
   time was split between progressive Republicans, conservative
   Republicans, and Democrats. Each put forth a candidate, and the ballots
   were deadlocked until August when a compromise was reached. Democratic
   candidate Augustus Bacon served as pro tempore for one day on August
   14, 1911, and thereafter he and four Republicans rotated holding the
   seat for the remainder of the 62nd Congress.

   Since the 63rd Congress, presidents pro tempore have been chosen as
   they had been from 1890–1911:^[8]
