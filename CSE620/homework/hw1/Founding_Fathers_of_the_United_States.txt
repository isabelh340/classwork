   The Founding Fathers of the United States of America were political
   leaders and statesmen who participated in the American Revolution by
   signing the United States Declaration of Independence, taking part in
   the American Revolutionary War, and establishing the United States
   Constitution. Within the large group known as the "Founding Fathers",
   there are two key subsets: the Signers of the Declaration of
   Independence (who signed the United States Declaration of Independence
   in 1776) and the Framers of the Constitution (who were delegates to the
   Constitutional Convention and took part in framing or drafting the
   proposed Constitution of the United States). A further subset is the
   group that signed the Articles of Confederation.^[2]

   Some historians define the "Founding Fathers" to mean a larger group,
   including not only the Signers and the Framers but also all those who,
   whether as politicians, jurists, statesmen, soldiers, diplomats, or
   ordinary citizens, took part in winning American independence and
   creating the United States of America.^[3] Historian Richard B. Morris
   in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding
   Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay,
   Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.^[4] Three of
   these (Hamilton, Madison and Jay) were authors of the Federalist
   Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution.

   The phrase "Founding Fathers," applied to "an American statesman of the
   Revolutionary period, esp. a member of the American Constitutional
   Convention of 1787",^[5] has been in use since at least 1894.^[6] A
   more generalized use of "founding fathers" has been in place since at
   least 1886.^[7]

Background

   Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, by
   Howard Chandler Christy

   The First Continental Congress met briefly in Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania in 1774 and consisted of fifty-six delegates from twelve
   of the Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States of
   America. The delegates, who included George Washington, soon to command
   the army, Patrick Henry, and John Adams, were elected by their
   respective colonial assemblies. Other notable delegates included Samuel
   Adams from Massachusetts, John Dickinson from Pennsylvania and New
   York's John Jay. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to
   the British crown, established the Continental Association to
   administer boycott actions against Britain. When the Second Continental
   Congress came together on May 10, 1775, it was, in effect, a
   reconvening of the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who
   attended the first meeting participated in the second.^[8] Notable new
   arrivals included Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania,
   John Hancock of Massachusetts, and John Witherspoon of New Jersey.
   Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when
   Peyton Randolph was summoned back to Virginia to preside over the House
   of Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia
   congressional delegation.^[9] The second Congress adopted the
   Declaration of Independence. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman
   to sign the Declaration. He also signed the Articles of Confederation
   and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal
   Constitution.^[10]

   The newly founded country of the United States had to create a new
   government to replace the British Parliament. The Americans adopted the
   Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national
   government which was made up of a one-house legislature. Its
   ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new
   name: the Congress of the Confederation, which met from 1781 to
   1789.^[11] Later, the Constitutional Convention took place in 1787, in
   Philadelphia.^[12] Although the Convention was called to revise the
   Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its
   proponents—chief among them James Madison and Alexander Hamilton—was to
   create a new government rather than try to fix the inadequate existing
   one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the
   Convention. The result of the Convention was the United States
   Constitution.

Collective biography of the Framers of the Constitution

   In the winter and spring of 1786–1787, twelve of the thirteen states
   chose a total of 74 delegates to attend what is now known as the
   Federal Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to
   accept election or attend the debates; for example, Patrick Henry of
   Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and
   important than national politics, though during the ratification
   controversy of 1787–1788 he claimed, "I smelled a rat." Rhode Island
   did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the
   Convention delegates' motivations. As a sanctuary for Baptists, Rhode
   Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of
   Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did
   attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one
   time.^[13]

   These delegates represented a cross-section of 18th-century American
   leadership. Almost all of them were well-educated men of means who were
   leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national
   affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the American Revolution;
   at least 29 had served in the Continental Army, most of them in
   positions of command. Several of the latter were instrumental in
   establishing the Society of the Cincinnati in 1783. Scholars have
   examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the
   Declaration and the Constitution.^[14]

Political experience

   The Framers of the Constitution had extensive political experience. By
   1787, four-fifths (41 individuals), were or had been members of the
   Continental Congress. Nearly all of the 55 delegates had experience in
   colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and
   local offices.^[15]
     * Thomas Mifflin and Nathaniel Gorham had served as President of the
       Continental Congress.
     * The ones who lacked congressional experience were Bassett, Blair,
       Brearly, Broom, Davie, Dayton, Alexander Martin, Luther Martin,
       Mason, McClurg, Paterson, Charles Pinckney, Strong, Washington and
       Yates.
     * Eight men (Clymer, Franklin, Gerry, Robert Morris, Read, Roger
       Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) had signed the Declaration of
       Independence.
     * Six (Carroll, Dickinson, Gerry, Gouverneur Morris, Robert Morris,
       and Sherman) had signed the Articles of Confederation.
     * Two, Sherman and Robert Morris, signed all three of the nation's
       basic documents.
     * Dickinson, Franklin, Langdon, and Rutledge had been governors.

Occupations and finances

   The 1787 delegates practiced a wide range of high and middle-status
   occupations, and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They
   did not differ dramatically from the Loyalists, except they were
   generally younger and less senior in their professions.^[16]
     * Thirty-five had legal training, though not all of them practiced
       law. Some had also been local judges.^[17]
     * At the time of the convention, 13 men were merchants: Blount,
       Broom, Clymer, Dayton, Fitzsimons, Shields, Gilman, Gorham,
       Langdon, Robert Morris, Pierce, Sherman, and Wilson.
     * Seven were major land speculators: Blount, Dayton, Fitzsimons,
       Gorham, Robert Morris, Washington and Wilson.
     * Eleven speculated in securities on a large scale: Bedford, Blair,
       Clymer, Dayton, Fitzsimons, Franklin, King, Langdon, Robert Morris,
       Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Sherman.
     * Fourteen owned or managed slave-operated plantations or large
       farms: Bassett, Blair, Blount, Johnson, Butler, Carroll, Jenifer,
       Jefferson, Madison, Mason, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth
       Pinckney, Rutledge, Spaight, and Washington.
     * Many wealthy Northerners owned domestic slaves: Franklin later
       freed his slaves and was a key founder of the Pennsylvania
       Abolition Society. Jay founded the New York Manumission Society in
       1785, for which Hamilton became an officer. They and other members
       of the Society founded the African Free School in New York City, to
       educate the children of free blacks and slaves. When Jay was
       governor of New York in 1798, he signed into law a gradual
       abolition law; fully ending slavery as of 1827. He freed his own
       slaves in 1798.
     * Broom and Few were small farmers.
     * Eight of the men received a substantial part of their income from
       public office: Baldwin, Blair, Brearly, Gilman, Livingston,
       Madison, and Rutledge.
     * Three had retired from active economic endeavors: Franklin,
       McHenry, and Mifflin.
     * Franklin and Williamson were scientists, in addition to their other
       activities.
     * McClurg, McHenry, Rush and Williamson were physicians, and Johnson
       was a college president.

Family and finances

   A few of the 1787 delegates were wealthy, but many of the country's top
   wealth-holders were Loyalists who went to Britain. Most of the others
   had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent, but there
   are other founders who were less than wealthy. On the whole they were
   less wealthy than the Loyalists.^[18]

Demographics

   Brown (1976) and Harris (1969) provide detailed demographic information
   on each man.
     * Most of the 1787 delegates were natives of the Thirteen Colonies.
       Only 9 were born elsewhere: four (Butler, Fitzsimons, McHenry, and
       Paterson) in Ireland, two (Davie and Robert Morris) in England, two
       (Wilson and Witherspoon) in Scotland, and one (Hamilton) in the
       West Indies.
     * Many of them had moved from one state to another. Seventeen
       individuals had already lived, studied or worked in more than one
       state or colony: Baldwin, Bassett, Bedford, Dickinson, Few,
       Franklin, Ingersoll, Hamilton , Livingston, Alexander Martin,
       Luther Martin, Mercer, Gouverneur Morris, Robert Morris, Read,
       Sherman, and Williamson.
     * Several others had studied or traveled abroad.

   The Founding Fathers had strong educational backgrounds at some of the
   colonial colleges or abroad.^[19] Some, like Franklin and Washington,
   were largely self-taught or learned through apprenticeship. Others had
   obtained instruction from private tutors or at academies. About half of
   the men had attended or graduated from college. Some men held medical
   degrees or advanced training in theology. Most of the education was in
   the colonies, but several were lawyers who had been trained at the Inns
   of Court in London.

Longevity and family life

   Death age of the Founding Fathers.

   For their era, the 1787 delegates (like the 1776 signers) were average
   in terms of life spans.^[17] Their average age at death was about 67.
   The first to die was Houston in 1788; the last was Madison in 1836.

   Secretary Charles Thomson lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92.
   John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few—Franklin, Jefferson, Madison,
   Williamson, and Wythe—lived into their eighties. Either 15 or 16
   (depending on Fitzsimons's exact age) died in their seventies, 20 or 21
   in their sixties, eight in their fifties, and five only in their
   forties. Three (Alexander Hamilton, Richard Dobbs Spaight and Button
   Gwinnett) were killed in duels.

   Most of the delegates married and raised children. Sherman fathered the
   largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett,
   Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,
   Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. Four (Baldwin,
   Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of
   the delegates also had children conceived illegitimately.^[20]

Religion

   Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of
   the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional
   Convention, 49 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics (D.
   Carroll, and Fitzsimons).^[citation needed] Among the Protestant
   delegates to the Constitutional Convention, 28 were Church of England
   (or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), eight
   were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans,
   two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.^[citation needed]

   A few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical Christians, such as
   Thomas Jefferson^[21]^[22]^[23] (who created the so-called Jefferson
   Bible) and Benjamin Franklin.^[24] Others (most notably Thomas Paine,
   who authored the religious book The Age of Reason^[25]) were deists, or
   at least held beliefs very similar to those of deists.^[26]

   Historian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (Adams,
   Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington)
   were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid
   "theistic rationalism".^[27]

   The Treaty of Tripoli, states that "the Government of the United States
   of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian
   religion"^[28] and was passed unanimously by the Senate and signed by
   President John Adams.

Post-convention careers

   The 1787 delegates' subsequent careers reflected their abilities as
   well as the vagaries of fate.^[29] Most were successful, although seven
   (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and
   Wilson) suffered serious financial reverses that left them in or near
   bankruptcy. Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly
   treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention,
   most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to
   the new government they had helped to create.

Slaves and slavery

   See also: George Washington and slavery and Thomas Jefferson and
   slavery

   Many Founding Fathers, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
   and Benjamin Franklin owned slaves (Franklin later became an
   abolitionist) .^[30] Slaves and slavery are mentioned only indirectly
   in the 1787 Constitution. For example, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3
   prescribes that "three fifths of all other Persons" are to be counted
   for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and
   direct Taxes. Additionally, in Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3, slaves
   are referred to as "persons held in service or labor".^[30]^[31] The
   Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain
   slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or
   significantly reduce slavery after the American Revolution.^[31] In
   1782 Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed slave owners to
   free their slaves by will or deed.^[32] As a result, thousands of
   slaves were manumitted in Virginia.^[32] Thomas Jefferson in 1784
   proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to
   pass Congress by one vote.^[31] Partially following Jefferson's plan
   Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 for
   territory north of the Ohio River.^[31] The international slave trade
   was banned in all states except South Carolina by 1800. Finally in
   1807, President Jefferson signed into law a federally enforced ban on
   the international slave trade throughout all the United States and
   territories.^[33] President Jefferson, in 1804, however, allowed the
   domestic expansion or diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana
   Territory.^[34]

Legacy

   According to the historian Joseph J. Ellis, the concept of the Founding
   Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died
   out. Ellis says "the founders," or "the fathers," comprised an
   aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and
   singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer
   presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the
   generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s –
   men like Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C.
   Calhoun – "the founders" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction
   whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary
   accomplishments defied comparison.

     "We can win no laurels in a war for independence," Webster
     acknowledged in 1825. "Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them
     all. Nor are there places for us ... [as] the founders of states.
     Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty
     of defence and preservation."^[35]

   The last remaining founders, also called the "Last of the Romans",
   lived well into the nineteenth century.^[36]

       Observation, that when the People too late see their Error, yet the
       Clergy still persist in their Encomiums on the Hypocrite; and when
       he happens to die for the Good of his Country, without leaving
       behind him the Memory of one good Action, he shall be sure to have
       his Funeral Sermon stuff'd with Pious Expressions which he dropt at
       such a Time, and at such a Place, and on such an Occasion; than
       which nothing can be more prejudicial to the Interest of Religion,
       nor indeed to the Memory of the Person deceas'd. The Reason of this
       Blindness in the Clergy is, because they are honourably supported
       (as they ought to be) by their People, and see nor feel nothing of
       the Oppression which is obvious and burdensome to every one else."
