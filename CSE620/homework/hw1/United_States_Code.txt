   The Code of Laws of the United States of America^[1] (variously
   abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code,
   U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of
   the general and permanent federal laws of the United States. It
   contains 51 titles,^[2] along with a further four proposed titles.^[3]
   The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law
   Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative
   supplements are published annually.^[4]^[5] The official version of
   those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in
   United States Statutes at Large.

Level of law[edit]

   Main article: Law of the United States § Levels of law

   In the United States, federal laws are subordinate to the United States
   Constitution but preempt state and local laws. Federal law that
   conflicts with the U.S. Constitution is invalid. State and local laws
   that conflict with either the U.S. Constitution or federal law are also
   invalid. Disputes regarding validity of a law and conflicts between
   federal and state laws are resolved by the courts. Both federal and
   state laws are considered valid, commonly referred to as
   constitutional, until challenged and declared otherwise. Even laws
   declared invalid remain on the statute books unless and until they are
   formally repealed, and some rulings of invalidity have subsequently
   been reversed. Also, in the case of conflict between federal and state
   laws, if the federal law is repealed, it would re-activate the force of
   the state law.

Codification process[edit]

   The official text of an Act of Congress is that of the "enrolled bill"
   (traditionally printed on parchment) presented to the President for his
   signature or disapproval. Upon enactment of a law, the original bill is
   delivered to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) within the
   National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).^[6] After
   authorization from the OFR,^[7] copies are distributed as "slip laws"
   by the Government Printing Office (GPO). The Archivist assembles annual
   volumes of the enacted laws and publishes them as the United States
   Statutes at Large. By law, the text of the Statutes at Large is "legal
   evidence" of the laws enacted by Congress.^[8] Slip laws are also
   competent evidence.^[9]

   The Statutes at Large, however, is not a convenient tool for legal
   research. It is arranged strictly in chronological order so that
   statutes addressing related topics may be scattered across many
   volumes. Statutes often repeal or amend earlier laws, and extensive
   cross-referencing is required to determine what laws are in force at
   any given time.

   The United States Code is the result of an effort to make finding
   relevant and effective statutes simpler by reorganizing them by subject
   matter, and eliminating expired and amended sections. The Code is
   maintained by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (LRC) of the U.S.
   House of Representatives. The LRC determines which statutes in the
   United States Statutes at Large should be codified, and which existing
   statutes are affected by amendments or repeals, or have simply expired
   by their own terms. The LRC updates the Code accordingly.

   Because of this codification approach, a single named statute (like the
   Taft–Hartley Act, or the Embargo Act) may or may not appear in a single
   place in the Code. Often, complex legislation bundles a series of
   provisions together as a means of addressing a social or governmental
   problem; those provisions often fall in different logical areas of the
   Code. For example, an Act providing relief for family farms might
   affect items in Title 7 (Agriculture), Title 26 (Tax), and Title 43
   (Public Lands). When the Act is codified, its various provisions might
   well be placed in different parts of those various Titles. Traces of
   this process are generally found in the Notes accompanying the "lead
   section" associated with the popular name, and in cross-reference
   tables that identify Code sections corresponding to particular Acts of
   Congress.

   Usually, the individual sections of a statute are incorporated into the
   Code exactly as enacted; however, sometimes editorial changes are made
   by the LRC (for instance, the phrase "the date of enactment of this
   Act" is replaced by the actual date). Though authorized by statute,
   these changes do not constitute positive law.^[4]

Legal status[edit]

   The authority for the material in the United States Code comes from its
   enactment through the legislative process and not from its presentation
   in the Code. For example, the United States Code omitted 12 U.S.C. § 92
   for decades, apparently because it was thought to have been repealed.
   In its 1993 ruling in U.S. National Bank of Oregon v. Independent
   Insurance Agents of America, the Supreme Court ruled that §92 was still
   valid law.^[10]

   The LRC continues the process of revising, updating, and restating the
   existing body of statutory law in codified form. As the LRC completes
   particular areas of the law, it proposes that the Congress enact those
   titles of the Code as "positive law" (i.e., make it an act of Congress
   itself rather than a restatement of various acts). If a particular
   title of the United States Code is enacted into law, the enactment
   repeals all previous enactments on the subject (including those found
   in the Statutes at Large), thereby making that title of the United
   States Code "legal evidence"^[11] of the law in force. However, In case
   of a conflict between the text of the Statutes at Large and the text of
   a provision of the United States Code that has not been enacted as
   positive law, the text of the Statutes at Large takes precedence.

   By law, those titles of the United States Code that have not been
   enacted into positive law are "prima facie evidence"^[12] of the law in
   effect. The United States Statutes at Large remains the ultimate
   authority. If a dispute arises as to the accuracy or completeness of
   the codification of an unenacted title, the courts will turn to the
   language in the United States Statutes at Large. Where a title has been
   enacted into positive law, however, a court may neither permit nor
   require proof of the underlying original statutes.^[13] The distinction
   between enacted and unenacted titles is largely academic because the
   Code is nearly always accurate. The United States Code is routinely
   cited by the Supreme Court and other federal courts without mentioning
   this theoretical caveat. On a day-to-day basis, very few lawyers
   cross-reference the Code to the Statutes at Large. Attempting to
   capitalize on the possibility that the text of the United States Code
   can differ from the United States Statutes at Large, Bancroft-Whitney
   for many years published a series of volumes known as United States
   Code Service (USCS), which used the actual text of the United States
   Statutes at Large.

Uncodified statutes[edit]

   Only "general and permanent" laws are codified; the Code does not
   usually include provisions that apply only to a limited number of
   people (a private law) or for a limited time, such as most
   appropriation acts or budget laws, which apply only for a single fiscal
   year. If these limited provisions are significant, however, they may be
   printed as "notes" underneath related sections of the Code. The
   codification is based on the content of the laws, however, not the
   vehicle by which they are adopted; so, for instance, if an
   appropriations act contains substantive, permanent legislation (as is
   sometimes the case), the permanent provisions will be incorporated into
   the Code even though they were adopted as part of a non-permanent
   enactment.^[14]

Organization[edit]

   The Code is divided into 51 titles (listed below), which deal with
   broad, logically organized areas of legislation. Titles may optionally
   be divided into subtitles, parts, subparts, chapters, and subchapters.
   All titles have sections (represented by a §), as their basic coherent
   units, and sections are numbered sequentially across the entire title
   without regard to the previously-mentioned divisions of titles.
   Sections are often divided into (from largest to smallest) subsections,
   paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, subclauses, items, and
   subitems.^[15] Congress, by convention, names a particular subdivision
   of a section according to its largest element. For example, "subsection
   (c)(3)(B)(iv)" is not a subsection but a clause, namely clause (iv) of
   subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subsection (c); if the identity of
   the subsection and paragraph were clear from the context, one would
   refer to the clause as "subparagraph (B)(iv)".

   Not all titles use the same series of subdivisions above the section
   level, and they may arrange them in different order. For example, in
   Title 26 (the tax code), the order of subdivision runs:
     * Title
     * (Subtitle)
          + Chapter
          + (Subchapter)
               o Part
               o (Subpart)
                    # Section
                    # (Subsection)
                         @ Paragraph
                         @ (Subparagraph)
                              - Clause
                              - (Subclause)

   In Title 38 (Veteran's Benefits) the order runs Title - Part - Chapter
   - Subchapter - Section. Put another way, the Title is always the
   largest division of the Code, and the section the smallest (except for
   subsections, paragraphs, clauses, etc.), but intermediate levels vary
   in both number and sequence from Title to Title.

   The word "title" in this context is roughly akin to a printed "volume,"
   although many of the larger titles span multiple volumes. Similarly, no
   particular size or length is associated with other subdivisions; a
   section might run several pages in print, or just a sentence or two.
   Some subdivisions within particular titles acquire meaning of their
   own; for example, it is common for lawyers to refer to a "Chapter 11
   bankruptcy" or a "Subchapter S corporation" (often shortened to "S
   corporation").

   According to one legal style manual,^[16] a sample citation would be
   "Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (2006)", read aloud as "Title
   five, United States Code, section five fifty-two A" or simply "five USC
   five fifty-two A."

Treatment of repealed laws[edit]

   When sections are repealed, their text is deleted and replaced by a
   note summarizing what used to be there. This is so that lawyers reading
   old cases can understand what the cases are talking about. As a result,
   some portions of the Code consist entirely of empty chapters full of
   historical notes. For example, Title 8, Chapter 7 is labeled "Exclusion
   of Chinese." This contains historical notes relating to the Chinese
   Exclusion Act, which is no longer in effect.

Cases of awkward numbering[edit]

   Sometimes, Congress or the LRC underestimates the future importance of
   a new government program, and does not reserve enough space in the
   U.S.C.'s section numbers for future statutes related to that program.
   Then Congress never gets around to the task of reorganizing and
   renumbering all the sections in a title, which forces Congressional
   drafters to resort to awkward methods to shoehorn new laws into the
   existing section numbering of a title. One method is to add additional
   letters and numbers to section numbers; another method is to simply jam
   more subsections under a single section number. In turn, some parts of
   the U.S.C. feature sections with strange numbers which have so many
   subsections included that they become very difficult to read. Many
   examples can be found in the statutes governing the huge Medicare and
   Medicaid programs, which were originally assigned, respectively, to
   sections 1395 and 1396 of Title 42. Take for example 42
   U.S.C. § 1396u-2(d)(2)(A)(i)(II), which requires state approval of
   certain marketing materials.

Versions and history[edit]

Early compilations[edit]

   Early efforts at codifying the Acts of Congress were undertaken by
   private publishers; these were useful shortcuts for research purposes,
   but had no official status. Congress undertook an official codification
   called the Revised Statutes of the United States approved June 22,
   1874, for the laws in effect as of December 1, 1873. Congress
   re-enacted a corrected version in 1878. The Revised Statutes were
   enacted as positive law, but subsequent enactments were not
   incorporated into the official code, so that over time researchers once
   again had to delve through many volumes of the Statutes at Large.

   According to the preface to the Code, "From 1897 to 1907 a commission
   was engaged in an effort to codify the great mass of accumulating
   legislation. The work of the commission involved an expenditure of over
   $300,000, but was never carried to completion." In the absence of an
   official code, private publishers once again collected the more recent
   statutes into unofficial codes. The first edition of the United States
   Code (published as Statutes at Large Volume 44, Part 1) includes
   cross-reference tables between the U.S.C. and two of these unofficial
   codes, United States Compiled Statutes Annotated by West Publishing Co.
   and Federal Statutes Annotated by Edward Thompson Co.

Official code[edit]

   During the 1920s, some members of Congress revived the codification
   project, resulting in the approval of the United States Code by
   Congress in 1926.^[17]

   The official version of the Code is published by the LRC as a series of
   paper volumes. The first edition of the Code was contained in a single
   bound volume; today, it spans several large volumes. Normally, a new
   edition of the Code is issued every six years, with annual cumulative
   supplements identifying the changes made by Congress since the last
   "main edition" was published.^[5]

Digital and Internet versions[edit]

   Both the LRC and the GPO offer electronic versions of the Code to the
   public. The LRC electronic version used to be as much as 18 months
   behind current legislation, but as of 2014 it is one of the most
   current versions available online. The United States Code is available
   from the LRC at uscode.house.gov in both HTML and XML bulk
   formats.^[18]^[19] The "United States Legislative Markup" (USLM) schema
   of the XML was designed to be consistent with the Akoma Ntoso project
   (from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs) XML
   schema,^[20] and the OASIS LegalDocML technical committee standard will
   be based upon Akoma Ntoso.^[21]

   A number of other online versions are freely available, such as
   Cornell's Legal Information Institute.

Annotated codes[edit]

   Practicing lawyers who can afford them almost always use an annotated
   version of the U.S. Code from a private company. The two leading
   annotated versions are the United States Code Annotated, abbreviated as
   U.S.C.A., and the United States Code Service, abbreviated as U.S.C.S.
   The U.S.C.A. is published by West (part of Thomson Reuters), and
   U.S.C.S. is published by LexisNexis (part of Reed Elsevier), which
   purchased the publication from the Lawyers Co-operative Publishing Co.
   in 1997 as a result of an antitrust settlement.^[22] These annotated
   versions contain notes following each section of the law, which
   organize and summarize court decisions, law review articles, and other
   authorities that pertain to the code section, and may also include
   uncodified provisions that are part of the Public Laws. The publishers
   of these versions frequently issue supplements that contain newly
   enacted laws, which may not yet have appeared in an official published
   version of the Code, as well as updated secondary materials such as new
   court decisions on the subject. When an attorney is viewing an
   annotated code on an online service, such as Westlaw or LexisNexis, all
   the citations in the annotations are hyperlinked to the referenced
   court opinions and other documents.

Other relevant codifications[edit]

   The Code generally contains only those Acts of Congress known as public
   laws (although the notes sometimes contain related Executive Orders and
   other presidential documents). The Code does not contain statutes known
   as private laws. It also does not contain statutes that are not
   considered permanent (such as appropriations); nor does it contain
   regulations adopted by executive agencies through the rulemaking
   process set out in the Administrative Procedure Act. These regulations
   are published chronologically in the Federal Register and are then
   compiled by topic or subject matter in the Code of Federal Regulations
   (C.F.R.), which constitutes an additional important source of federal
   law.

Number and growth of criminal laws[edit]

   There are conflicting opinions on the number of federal
   crimes,^[23]^[24] but many have argued that there has been explosive
   growth and it has become overwhelming.^[25]^[26]^[27] In 1982, the U.S.
   Justice Department could not come up with a number, but estimated 3,000
   crimes in the United States Code.^[23]^[24]^[28] In 1998, the American
   Bar Association (ABA) said that it was likely much higher than 3,000,
   but didn't give a specific estimate.^[23]^[24] In 2008, the Heritage
   Foundation published a report that put the number at a minimum of
   4,450.^[24] When staff for a task force of the U.S. House Judiciary
   Committee asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to update its
   2008 calculation of criminal offenses in the U.S.C. in 2013, the CRS
   responded that they lack the manpower and resources to accomplish the
   task.^[29]

Parts of interest[edit]

     * The Uniform Code of Military Justice is contained in Title 10,
       Chapter 47. It defines infractions such as absence without leave
       and contains the popularly-known phrase, "Conduct unbecoming an
       officer and a gentleman".
     * Title 11 is the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Some of the different types
       of bankruptcy are commonly referred to simply by their chapter
       numbers:
          + Chapter 7
          + Chapter 11
          + Chapter 13
     * Title 18 deals with federal crimes, penalties and prisons.
     * Title 26 is also known as the Internal Revenue Code. Much of Title
       26 is administered and enforced by the Internal Revenue Service and
       is one of the largest portions of the Code.
     * Title 28 governs procedure in the United States federal courts.
     * Title 42 is a large and complex title which includes statutes
       governing several large federal government programs like Social
       Security and Medicare as well as entitlements, civil rights and
       many social programs. One provision, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, is the basis
       for a wide range of federal civil rights actions in federal courts;
       it is the codification of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. Section
       1983 cases include suits alleging use of excessive force by police
       and First Amendment suits against public schools to maintain
       church/state separation. Section 1983 itself is quite short; the
       annotations (i.e., the digests and summaries of court decisions
       interpreting it), however, span several volumes. Chapter 6A of
       Title 42 is the Public Health Service Act.

   * Includes Appendix of provisions not yet enacted into positive law.

Proposed titles[edit]

   The Office of Law Revision Counsel has produced draft text for an
   additional four titles of federal law. The subject matter of these
   titles exists today in one or several titles. If and when enacted,
   these titles would actually perform two functions: moving law from one
   location in the US Code to another, and to convert it into positive
   law.
   Title 53 Small Business
   Title 54 National Park System
   Title 55 Environment

   The OLRC announced an "editorial reclassification" of the federal laws
   governing voting and elections that went into effect on September 1,
   2014. This reclassification involved moving various laws previously
   classified in Titles 2 and 42 into a new Title 52.

       30, 2005—contains in its Division A, Title X the Detainee Treatment
       Act of 2005 ("DTA"). The DTA set out, among other things, permanent
       provisions governing standards for interrogation of persons in
       Defense Department custody, prohibitions on cruel and unusual

       the President signed into law on January 6, 2006 (a week after he
       signed the original DTA into law). The December 2005 and January
       2006 versions of the DTA are generally identical except for certain
       provisions in the section relating to training of Iraqi security
       forces (section 1006 of the Dec. '05 DTA and section 1406 of the
       Jan. '06 DTA). As a result, both the Dec. '05 and Jan. '06 DTAs
       appear to have made essentially simultaneous and duplicative
       amendments to the Code and its notes. But see the legislative
       history notes under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (to the effect that two
       subsection (e)s of that statutory section have apparently been
       enacted). As of 14 September 2014, there has been no litigation
       challenging the validity of either of the DTA statutes on these
       grounds.
