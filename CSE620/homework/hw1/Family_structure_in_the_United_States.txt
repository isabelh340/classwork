   A Multigenerational Family
   An American family composed of the mother, father, children, and
   extended family.

   The traditional family structure in the United States is considered a
   family support system involving two married individuals providing care
   and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent,
   nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms
   have become more common.^[1] The family is created at birth and
   establishes ties across generations.^[2] Those generations, the
   extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold
   significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.

   Over time, the traditional structure has had to adapt to very
   influential changes, including divorce and the introduction of
   single-parent families, teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers, and
   same-sex marriage, and increased interest in adoption. Social movements
   such as the feminist movement and the stay-at-home dad have contributed
   to the creation of alternative family forms, generating new versions of
   the American family.

At a glance[edit]

   This figure illustrates the changing structure of families in the U.S.
   Only 7% of families in the U.S. in 2002 were "traditional" families in
   the sense that the husband worked and earned a sufficient income for
   the wife and kids to stay home. Many families are now dual-earner
   families. The "other" group includes the many households that are
   headed by a single parent.

Nuclear family[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Nuclear family.

   The nuclear family has been considered the "traditional" family since
   the communist scare in the cold war of the 1950s. The nuclear family
   consists of a mother, father, and the children. The two-parent nuclear
   family has become less prevalent, and pre-American and European family
   forms have become more common.^[1] These include homosexual
   relationships, single-parent households, adopting individuals, and
   extended family systems living together. The nuclear family is also
   choosing to have fewer children than in the past.^[3] The percentage of
   married-couple households with children under 18 has declined to 23.5%
   of all households in 2000 from 25.6% in 1990, and from 45% in 1960.

Single parent[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Single parent.
   See also: Teenage pregnancy

   A single parent (also termed lone parent or sole parent) is a parent
   who cares for one or more children without the assistance of the other
   biological parent. Historically, single-parent families often resulted
   from death of a spouse, for instance in childbirth. Single-parent homes
   are increasing as married couples divorce, or as unmarried couples have
   children. Although widely believed to be detrimental to the mental and
   physical well being of a child, this type of household is
   tolerated.^[4]

   The percentage of single-parent households has doubled in the last
   three decades, but that percentage tripled between 1900 and 1950.^[5]
   The sense of marriage as a "permanent" institution has been weakened,
   allowing individuals to consider leaving marriages more readily then
   they may have in the past.^[6] Increasingly single parent families are
   due to out of wedlock births, especially those due to unintended
   pregnancy.

Step Families[edit]

   Stepfamilies are becoming more familiar in America. Divorce rates are
   rising and the remarriage rate is rising as well, therefore, bringing
   two families together making step families. Statistics show that there
   are 1,300 new stepfamilies forming every day. Over half of American
   families are remarried, that is 75% of marriages ending in divorce,
   remarry.^[7]

Extended family[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Extended family.

   The extended family consists of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and
   cousins. In some circumstances, the extended family comes to live
   either with or in place of a member of the nuclear family. An example
   includes elderly parents who move in with their children due to old
   age. This places large demands on the caregivers, particularly the
   female relatives who choose to perform these duties for their extended
   family.^[8]

   Historically, among certain Asian and Native American cultures the
   family structure consisted of a grandmother and her children,
   especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared
   child care responsibilities. Uncles, brothers, and other male relatives
   sometimes helped out. Romantic relationships between men and women were
   formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in
   the mother's extended family.

Roles and relationships[edit]

Married partners[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Marriage in the United States.

   A married couple was defined as a "husband and wife enumerated as
   members of the same household" by the U.S. Census Bureau,^[9] but they
   will be categorizing same-sex couples as married couples if they are
   married. Same-sex couples who were married were previously recognized
   by the Census Bureau as unmarried partners.^[10] Same-sex marriage is
   legally permitted in 19 U.S. states, 8 Native American Tribal
   Jurisdictions, and the District of Columbia. Limited recognition has
   been granted to out-of-state same-sex marriages in Alaska,
   Colorado,^[11] Missouri, Utah, and Ohio.^[12] Polygamy is illegal
   throughout the U.S.^[13] Although Cousin marriages are illegal in most
   states, they are legal in many states, the District of Columbia and
   some territories. Some states have some restrictions or exceptions for
   cousin marriages and/or recognize such marriages performed
   out-of-state. Since the 1940s, the United States marriage rate has
   decreased, whereas rates of divorce have increased.^[14]

Unwed partners[edit]

   See also: Cohabitation in the United States

   Living as unwed partners is also known as cohabitation. The number of
   heterosexual unmarried couples in the United States has increased
   tenfold, from about 400,000 in 1960 to more than five million in
   2005.^[15] This number would increase by at least another 594,000 if
   same-sex partners were included.^[15] Of all unmarried couples, about 1
   in 9 (11.1% of all unmarried-partner households) are homosexual.^[15]
   The cohabitation lifestyle is becoming more popular in today's
   generation.^[16] It is more convenient for couples not to get married
   because it can be cheaper and simpler. As divorce rates rise in
   society, the desire to get married is less attractive for couples
   uncertain of their long-term plans.^[15]

Parents[edit]

   Parents can be either the biological mother or biological father, or
   the legal guardian for adopted children. Traditionally, mothers were
   responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing
   financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from
   teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their
   grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and
   culture.^[17] Older parents are financially established and generally
   have less problems raising children compared to their teenage
   counterparts.^[18]

Housewives[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Housewife.

   A housewife is a married woman who does not work outside of the home
   for income but stays and takes care of the home and children. This
   includes doing the cooking, washing, cleaning, etc. The roles of women
   working within the house has changed drastically as more women start to
   pursue careers. The amount of time women spend doing housework declined
   from 27 hours per week in 1965 to less than 16 hours in 1995, but it is
   still substantially more housework than their male partners.^[19]

"Breadwinners"[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Breadwinner model.

   A breadwinner is the main financial provider in the family.
   Historically the husband has been the breadwinner; that trend is
   changing as wives start to take advantage of the women's movement to
   gain financial independence for themselves. According to the New York
   Times, "In 2001, wives earned more than their spouses in almost a third
   of married households where the wife worked."^[20] Yet, even within
   nuclear families in which both spouses are employed outside of the
   home, many men are still responsible for a substantially smaller share
   of household duties.^[21]

Stay-at-home dads[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Stay-at-home dad.

   Stay-at-home dads are fathers that do not participate in the labor
   market and raise their children—the male equivalent to housewives.
   Stay-at-home dads are not as popular in American society.^[22]
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, "There are an estimated 105,000
   'stay-at-home' dads. These are married fathers with children under 15
   who are not in the labor force primarily so they can care for family
   members while their wives work outside the home. Stay-at-home dads care
   for 189,000 children."^[23]

Children[edit]

   See also: family planning

Only child families[edit]

   An only child (single child) is one without any biological or adopted
   brothers or sisters. Single children are stereotypically portrayed as
   spoiled, self-centered, and selfish. Single children often excel more
   in school and in their careers than children with siblings.^[19]

Childfree and Childlessness[edit]

   Childfree couples chose to not have children. These include young
   couples, who intend to have children later, as well as those who do not
   plan to have any children.

   Involuntary childlessness may be caused by infertility, medical
   problems, death of a child, or other factors.

Adopted children[edit]

   Adopted children are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or
   were unable to be cared for by their biological parents. They may have
   been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It
   is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster
   care: only 50,000 children were adopted in 2001.^[24] The average age
   of these children was 7 years old, which shows that fewer older
   children were adopted.^[24]

Controversies[edit]

Same-sex marriage, adoption, and child rearing[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Same-sex adoption.

   Same-sex parents are gay or lesbian couples that choose to raise
   children. Nationally, 66% of female same-sex couples and 44% of male
   same-sex couples live with children under 18 years old.^[22] In the
   2000 census, there were 594,000 households that claimed to be headed by
   same-sex couples, with 72% of those having children.^[25] In July 2004,
   the American Psychological Association concluded that "Overall results
   of research suggests that the development, adjustment, and well-being
   of children with lesbian and gay parents do not differ markedly from
   that of children with heterosexual parents."^[26]

Single-parent households[edit]

   Single-parent homes in America are starting to become more common in
   today's society. With more children being born to unmarried couples and
   to couples whose marriages subsequently dissolve, children increasingly
   live with only one parent. The proportion of children living with a
   never-married parent has also grown, from 4% in 1960 to 42% in
   2001.^[27] Of all one parent families, 83% are mother–child
   families.^[27]

Adoption requirements[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Adoption in the United States.

   The adoption requirements and policies for adopting children have made
   it harder for foster families and potential adoptive families to adopt
   kids. Before a family can adopt they must go through state, county, and
   agency criteria. Adoption agencies' criteria express the importance of
   age of the adoptive parents, as well as the agency's desire for married
   couples over single adopters.^[28] Adoptive parents also have to deal
   with criteria that are given by the birth parents of the adoptive
   child. The different criteria for adopting children makes it harder for
   couples to adopt children in need,^[28] but the strict requirements can
   help protect the foster children from unqualified couples.^[28]

   Currently 1.5 million (2%) of all U.S children are adopted. There are
   different types of adoption; embryo adoption when a couple is having
   trouble conceiving a child and instead choose to have their sperm and
   egg conjoined outside the womb, international adoption where couples
   adopt children that come from foreign countries, and private adoption
   which is the most common form of adoption. In private adoption,
   families can adopt children via licensed agencies or with by directly
   contacting the child's biological parents.

Male/female role pressures[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Gender role.

   The traditional "father" and "mother" roles of the nuclear family have
   become blurred over time. Because of the women's movement's push for
   women to engage in traditionally masculine pursuits in society, as
   women choose to sacrifice their child-bearing years to establish their
   careers, and as fathers feel increasing pressure to be involved with
   tending to children, the traditional roles of fathers as the
   "breadwinners" and mothers as the "caretakers" have come into
   question.^[29]

African-American family structure[edit]

   See also: African-American family structure

   According to Angela Hattery and Earl Smith, the current state of the
   African-American family is in trouble.^[30] As defined by respected
   scholars, “family is a set of people with whom you live and with whom
   you share biological and/or legal ties.”^[31] The defining points of a
   family in this definition are the individual’s one shares biological
   ties to, but within the African-American family, America is starting to
   see a decline in family structures that remain tied together by
   marriage and childbearing.^[30] According to Hattery and Smith,
   African-American are the least likely to marry. Due to this family
   structure, 62% of African-American babies are born outside of marriage
   and an even greater percentage are raised outside of the traditional
   nuclear family structures. The modern black family has seen a change
   from the traditional patriarchal married family and is now viewed as
   predominantly single parent, specifically black matriarchy.^[32]

Television portrayals[edit]

   The television industry initially helped create a stereotype of the
   American nuclear family. During the era of the baby boomers, families
   became a popular social topic, especially on television.^[33] Family
   shows such as Roseanne, All in the Family, Leave It to Beaver, The
   Cosby Show, Married... with Children, The Jeffersons, and Good Times
   have portrayed different social classes of families growing up in
   America. Those "perfect" nuclear families have changed as the years
   passed and have become more inclusive, showing single-parent and
   divorced families, as well as older singles.^[4] Television shows that
   show single-parent families include Half & Half, One on One, Murphy
   Brown, and Gilmore Girls.

   While it did not become a common occurrence the iconic image of the
   American family was started in the early 1930s. It was not until WWII
   that families generally had the economical income in which to
   successfully propagate this lifestyle.^[34]
