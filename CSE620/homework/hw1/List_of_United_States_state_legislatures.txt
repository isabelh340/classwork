   Each state in the United States has a legislature as part of its form
   of civil government. Most of the fundamental details of the legislature
   are specified in the state constitution. 49 state legislatures are
   bicameral bodies, composed of a lower house (Assembly, General
   Assembly, State Assembly, House of Delegates or House of
   Representatives) and an upper house (Senate). The Nebraska Legislature
   is the lone unicameral body.

   The exact names, dates, term lengths, term limits, electoral districts,
   and other details are at the discretion of the individual states.

Party summary[edit]

   The party composition of the legislatures (and party summary of the
   individual chambers), as of January 31, 2014, is:^[1]
   28 Republican-controlled legislatures
   17 Democratic-controlled legislatures
   5  Split legislatures
   50 Total

   "Split" means that either the two chambers have different majority
   parties (e.g., Democratic Senate and Republican House), that one
   chamber is evenly split between parties, or that a coalition or "hung"
   chamber has occurred.

   In several states, the party that controls the legislature may not be
   the one that usually wins the state in presidential elections. Also
   note that due to politics, a party with a numerical majority in a
   chamber may be forced to share power with other parties due to informal
   coalitions, or outright cede power due to divisions.

   The table below shows total state government control, which means the
   governor and the chamber majorities are all of the same party.
   24 Republican-controlled governments
   13 Democratic-controlled governments

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ The Constitution of California names it the "California
       Legislature", but the Legislature brands itself as the "California
       State Legislature".
    2. ^ The Constitution of Louisiana vests legislative authority in "a
       legislature, consisting of a Senate and a House of
       Representatives," and refers to it as "the legislature" throughout,
       without officially designating a term for the two houses together.
       However, the two bodies do use the term "Louisiana State
       Legislature" in official references to itself.
    3. ^ The Constitution of Utah names it the "Legislature of the State
       of Utah", but the Legislature brands itself as the "Utah State
       Legislature".
    4. ^ The Constitution of Washington names it "the legislature of the
       state of Washington", but the Legislature brands itself as the
       "Washington State Legislature".
