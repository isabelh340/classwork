Tourism in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   The Grand Canyon of Arizona attracts approximately 4.41 million
   visitors each year.

   Tourism in the United States is a large industry that serves millions
   of international and domestic tourists yearly. Tourists visit the US to
   see natural wonders, cities, historic landmarks, and entertainment
   venues. Americans seek similar attractions, as well as recreation and
   vacation areas.

   Tourism in the United States grew rapidly in the form of urban tourism
   during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By the 1850s,
   tourism in the United States was well established both as a cultural
   activity and as an industry. New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia,
   Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, all major US cities, attracted a
   large number of tourists by the 1890s. By 1915, city touring had marked
   significant shifts in the way Americans perceived, organized, and moved

   Democratization of travel occurred during the early twentieth century
   when the automobile revolutionized travel. Similarly air travel
   revolutionized travel during 1945–1969, contributing greatly to tourism
   in the United States. Purchases of travel and tourism-related goods and
   services by international visitors traveling in the United States
   totaled $10.9 billion during February 2013.^[1]

   The travel and tourism industry in the United States was among the
   first commercial casualties of the September 11, 2001 attacks, a series
   of terrorist attacks on the US. Terrorists used four commercial
   airliners as weapons of destruction, all of which were destroyed in the
   attacks with 3,000 casualties.

   In the US, tourism is either the first, second, or third largest
   employer in 29 states,^[which?] employing 7.3 million in 2004, to take
   care of 1.19 billion trips tourists took in the US in 2005. As of 2007,
   there are 2,462 registered National Historic Landmarks (NHL) recognized
   by the United States government. As of 2008, the most visited tourist
   attraction in the US is Times Square in Manhattan, New York City which
   attracts approximately 35 million visitors yearly.

   Tourists spend more money in the United States than any other country,
   while attracting the second-highest number of tourists after
   France.^[2] The discrepancy may be explained by longer stays in the
   US.^[2]

History[edit]

19th century[edit]

   The rise of urban tourism in the United States during the late
   nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represented a major cultural
   transformation concerning urban space, leisure natural activity and as
   an industry.^[3] Although travel agents and package tours did not exist
   until the 1870s and 1880s, entrepreneurs of various sorts from hotel
   keepers and agents for railroad lines to artists and writers recognized
   the profit to be gained from the prospering tourism industry.^[3] The
   rise of locomotive steam-powered trains during the 1800s enabled
   tourists to travel more easily and quickly.^[4]

   In the United States 2,800 miles (4,500 km) of track had been completed
   by 1840, by 1860 all major eastern US cities were linked by rail, and
   by 1869 the first trans-American railroad link was completed.^[5]
   Yosemite Park was developed as a tourist attraction in the late 1850s
   and early 1860s for an audience who wanted a national icon and place to
   symbolize exotic wonder of its region.^[3] Photography played an
   important role for the first time in the development of tourist
   attractions, making it possible to distribute hundreds of images
   showing various places of interest.^[3]

   New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and San
   Francisco, all major US cities, attracted a large number of tourists by
   the 1890s.^[6] New York's population grew from 300,000 in 1840 to
   800,000 in 1850.^[7] Chicago experienced a dramatic increase from 4,000
   residents in 1840 to 300,000 by 1870. Dictionaries first published the
   word 'tourist' sometime in 1800, when it referred to those going to
   Europe or making a round trip of natural wonders in New York and New
   England. The absence of urban tourism during the nineteenth century was
   in part because American cities lacked the architecture and art which
   attracted thousands to Europe. American cities tended to offend the
   sensitive with ugliness and commercialism rather than inspire awe or
   aesthetic pleasure.^[8] Some tourists were fascinated by the rapid
   growth of the new urban areas: "It is an absorbing thing to watch the
   process of world-making; both the formation of the natural and the
   conventional world," wrote English writer Harriet Martineau in
   1837.^[9]
   The Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts was one of
   many similar institutions classed as tourist attractions in the late
   nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

   As American cities developed, new institutions to accommodate and care
   for the insane, disabled and criminal were constructed. The Hartford,
   Connecticut American School for the Deaf opened in 1817, Ossining, New
   York state prison (now known as Sing Sing) in 1825, the Connecticut
   State Penitentiary at Wethersfield in 1827, Mount Auburn Cemetery in
   1831, the Perkins School for the Blind in 1832, and the Worcester State
   Hospital in 1833.^[10]

   These institutions attracted the curiosity of American and foreign
   visitors. The English writer and actress Fanny Kemble was an admirer of
   the American prison system who was also concerned that nature was being
   destroyed in favor of new developments. Guidebooks published in the
   1830s, 40s and 50s described new prisons, asylums and institutions for
   the deaf and blind, and urged tourists to visit these sights.^[11]

   Accounts of these visits written by Charles Dickens, Harriet Martineau,
   Lydia Sigourney and Caroline Gilman were published in magazines and
   travel books.^[11] Sigourney's Scenes in My Native Land (1845) included
   descriptions of her tour of Niagara Falls and other places of scenic
   interest with accounts of her visits to prisons and asylums.^[11] Many
   visited these institutions because nothing like them had existed
   before.^[12] The buildings which housed them were themselves
   monumental, often placed on hilltops as a symbol of
   accomplishment.^[12]

Early Tourism[edit]

   By 1915, city touring had marked significant shifts in the way
   Americans perceived, organized and moved around in urban
   environments.^[6] Urban tourism became a profitable industry in 1915 as
   the number of tour agencies, railroad passenger departments, guidebook
   publishers and travel writers grew at a fast pace.^[6] The expense of
   pleasure tours meant that only the minority of Americans between 1850
   and 1915 could experience the luxury of tourism.^[6] Many Americans
   traveled to find work, but few found time for enjoyment of the urban
   environment. As transportation networks improved, the length of
   commuting decreased, and income rose.^[6] A growing number of Americans
   were able to afford short vacations by 1915. Still, mass tourism was
   not possible until after World War II.^[6]

   During the nineteenth century, tourism of any form had been available
   only to the upper and middle classes. This changed during the early
   twentieth century through the democratization of travel. In 1895,
   popular publications printed articles showing the car was cheaper to
   operate than the horse.^[13] The development of automobiles in the
   early 1900s included the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. In
   1900, 8,000 cars were registered in the US, which increased to 619,000
   by 1911.^[14] By the time of the Model T's introduction in 1908, there
   were 44 US households per car.^[14] Early cars were a luxury for the
   wealthy, but after Ford began to dramatically drop prices after 1913,
   more were able to afford one.^[15]

   The development of hotels with leisure complexes had become a popular
   development during the 1930s in the United States.^[16] The range of
   "club" type holidays available appealed to a broad segment of the
   holiday market.^[16] As more families traveled independently by car,
   hotels failed to cater to their needs.^[16] Kemmons Wilson opened the
   first motel as a new form of accommodation in Memphis, Tennessee in
   1952.^[16]
   The Art Deco district of South Beach in Miami, Florida was developed
   during the 1930s.

   Although thousands of tourists visited Florida during the early 1900s,
   it was not until after World War II that the tourist industry quickly
   became Florida's largest source of income.^[17] Florida's white sandy
   beaches, hot summer temperatures and wide range of activities such as
   swimming, fishing, boating and hiking all attracted tourists to the
   state. During the 1930s, architects designed Art Deco style buildings
   in Miami Beach.^[18] Visitors are still attracted to the Art Deco
   district of Miami.^[18] Theme parks were soon built across Florida. One
   of the largest resorts in the world, Walt Disney World Resort, was
   opened near Orlando, Florida in 1971.^[19] In its first year, the
   28,000-acre (110 km^2) park added $14 billion to Orlando's economy.

Late 20th century[edit]

   The Douglas DC-4 was one of the first airliners in the United States
   used for commercial flights.

   The revolution of air travel between 1945 and 1969 contributed greatly
   to tourism in the United States. In that quarter century, commercial
   aviation evolved from 28-passenger airliners flying at less than
   200 mph (320 km/h) to 150-passenger jetliners cruising continents at
   600 mph (970 km/h).^[20] During this time, air travel in the US evolved
   from a novelty into a routine for business travelers and vacationers
   alike. Rapid developments in aviation technology, economic prosperity
   in the United States and the demand for air travel all contributed to
   the early beginnings of commercial aviation in the US.^[20]

   During the first four decades of the twentieth century, long-haul
   journeys between large American cities were accomplished using trains.
   By the 1950s, air travel was part of every-day life for many
   Americans.^[20] The tourism industry in the US experienced exponential
   growth as tourists could travel almost anywhere with a fast, reliable
   and routine system.^[20] For some, a vacation in Hawaii was now a more
   frequent pleasure. Air travel changed everything from family vacations
   to Major League Baseball, as had steam-powered trains in the nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries.^[20]

   By the end of the twentieth century, tourism had significantly grown
   throughout the world. The World Tourism Organisation (WTO, 1998)
   recorded that, in 1950, arrivals of tourists from abroad, excluding
   same-day visits, numbered about 25.2 million.^[21] By 1997, the figure
   was 612.8 million. In 1950 receipts from international movements were
   US$2.1 billion, in 1997 they were $443.7 billion.^[21]

21st century[edit]

   The travel and tourism industry in the United States was among the
   first commercial casualties of the September 11, 2001 attacks, a series
   of terrorist attacks on the US. Terrorists used four commercial
   airliners as weapons of destruction, all of which were destroyed in the
   attacks with 3,000 casualties.^[22] In the first full week after
   flights resumed, passenger numbers fell by nearly 45 percent, from 9
   million in the week before September 11 to 5 million.^[22] Hotels and
   travel agencies received cancellations across the world. The hotel
   industry suffered an estimated $700 million loss in revenue during the
   four days following the attacks.^[22] The situation recovered over the
   following months as the Federal Reserve kept the financial system
   afloat. The U.S. Congress issued a $5 billion grant to the nation's
   airlines and $10 billion in loan guarantees to keep them flying.^[22]

   In the US, tourism is either the first, second or third largest
   employer in 29 states, employing 7.3 million in 2004, to take care of
   1.19 billion trips tourists took in the US in 2005.^[23] The US
   outbound holiday market is sensitive in the short term, but possibly
   one of the most surprising results from the September 11, 2001 attacks
   was that by February 2002 it had bounced back for overseas travel,
   especially to destinations like New Zealand. This quick revival was
   generally quicker than many commentators had predicted only five months
   earlier.^[24]

   The United States economy began to slow significantly in 2007, mostly
   because of a real-estate slump, gas prices and related financial
   problems.^[25] Many economists believe that the economy entered a
   recession at the end of 2007 or early in 2008.^[25] Some state budgets
   for tourism marketing have decreased, such as Connecticut which is
   facing soaring gas prices.^[26]
