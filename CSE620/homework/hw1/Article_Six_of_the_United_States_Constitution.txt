   Article Six of the United States Constitution establishes the laws and
   treaties of the United States made in accordance with it as the supreme
   law of the land, forbids a religious test as a requirement for holding
   a governmental position and holds the United States under the
   Constitution responsible for debts incurred by the United States under
   the Articles of Confederation.

Text[edit]

     All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the
     Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United
     States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.

     This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be
     made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be
     made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
     Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound
     thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the
     Contrary notwithstanding.

     The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members
     of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial
     Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall
     be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but
     no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any
     Office or public Trust under the United States.

Debts[edit]

   The first clause of the Article provides that debts contracted prior to
   the adoption of the Constitution remain valid, as they were under the
   Articles of Confederation.

Supremacy[edit]

   Main article: Supremacy Clause

   Clause two provides that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant
   to it and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law
   of the land. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme
   law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law
   must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal
   law.

   The Supreme Court under John Marshall was influential in construing the
   supremacy clause. It first ruled that it had the power to review the
   decisions of state courts allegedly in conflict with the supreme law,
   claims of "state sovereignty" notwithstanding. In Martin v. Hunter's
   Lessee (1816), the Supreme Court confronted the Chief Justice of
   Virginia, Spencer Roane, who had previously declared a Supreme Court
   decision unconstitutional and refused to permit the state courts to
   abide by it. The Court upheld the Judiciary Act, which permitted it to
   hear appeals from state courts, on the grounds that Congress had passed
   it under the supremacy clause.

   The Supreme Court has also struck down attempts by states to control or
   direct the affairs of federal institutions. McCulloch v. Maryland
   (1819) was a significant case in this regard. The state of Maryland had
   levied a tax on banks not chartered by the state; the tax applied,
   state judges ruled, to the Bank of the United States chartered by
   Congress in 1816. Marshall wrote that "the States have no power, by
   taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner
   control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress
   to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government."
   United States property is wholly immune to state taxation, as are
   government activities and institutions. Congress may explicitly provide
   immunity from taxation in certain cases, for instance by immunizing a
   federal contractor. Federal employees, however, may not be immunized
   from taxes, as the tax would not in any way impede government
   activities.

   Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) was another influential case involving the
   supremacy clause. The state of New York had granted Aaron Ogden a
   monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. The other
   party, Thomas Gibbons, had obtained a federal permit under the Coastal
   Licensing Act to perform the same task. The Supreme Court upheld the
   federal permit. John Marshall wrote, "The nullity of an act,
   inconsistent with the Constitution, is produced by the declaration,
   that the Constitution is the supreme law. The appropriate application
   of that part of the clause which confers the same supremacy on laws and
   treaties, is to such acts of the State legislatures as do not transcend
   their powers, but though enacted in the execution of acknowledged State
   powers, interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of Congress, made
   in pursuance of the Constitution, or some treaty made under the
   authority of the United States. In every such case, the act of
   Congress, or the treaty, is supreme; and the law of the State, though
   enacted in the exercise of powers not controverted, must yield to it."

   Reid v. Covert (1957) ruled that no branch of the United States
   Government can have powers conferred upon it by treaty that have not
   been conferred by the United States Constitution.

Oaths[edit]

   See also: No Religious Test Clause and Qur'an oath controversy of the
   110th United States Congress

   Federal and state legislators, executive officers and judges are, by
   the third clause of the article, bound by oath or affirmation to
   support the Constitution. Congress may determine the form of such an
   oath. In Ex parte Garland (1866), the Supreme Court held that a test
   oath would violate the Constitution, so it invalidated the law
   requiring the following oath:

     I, A. B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never
     voluntarily borne arms against the United States since I have been a
     citizen thereof; that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance,
     counsel, or encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility
     thereto; that I have neither sought nor accepted, not attempted to
     exercise the functions of any office whatever, under any authority
     or pretended authority in hostility to the United States; that I
     have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government,
     authority, power, or constitution with the United States, hostile or
     inimical thereto...

   The Supreme Court found that the law constituted an unconstitutional ex
   post facto law, for it retroactively punished the offenses mentioned in
   the oath by preventing those who committed them from taking office.

   Congress may not require religious tests for an office under the United
   States. Thus, Congress may include the customary words "so help me God"
   in an oath, but an individual would be under no compulsion to utter
   them, as such a requirement would constitute a religious test.

   The current oath administered is as follows:

     I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and
     defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to
     the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental
     reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and
     faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to
     enter. [So help me God.]

   During the 1960 presidential campaign, the issue of whether the nation
   would for the first time elect a Catholic to the highest office in the
   land raised the specter of an implicit, but no less effective,
   religious test. John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston
   Ministerial Association on 12 September 1960, addressed the question
   directly, saying,

     [N]either do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert
     Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test, even
     by indirection. For if they disagree with that safeguard, they
     should be openly working to repeal it.

     . . . [C]ontrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic
     candidate for President.

     I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also
     to be a Catholic.

     I do not speak for my church on public matters; and the church does
     not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President, if
     I should be elected, on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling
     or any other subject, I will make my decision in accordance with
     these views – in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be
     in the national interest, and without regard to outside religious
     pressure or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could
     cause me to decide otherwise.

     But if the time should ever come – and I do not concede any conflict
     to be remotely possible – when my office would require me to either
     violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would
     resign the office; and I hope any other conscientious public servant
     would do likewise.

     But I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of
     either Catholic or Protestant faith; nor do I intend to disavow
     either my views or my church in order to win this election.

     If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in
     the Senate, satisfied that I'd tried my best and was fairly judged.

     But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million
     Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were
     baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the
     eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of
     history, and in the eyes of our own people.
