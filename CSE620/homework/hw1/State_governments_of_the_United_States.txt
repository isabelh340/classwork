   State governments in the United States are those republics formed by
   citizens in the jurisdiction thereof as provided by the United States
   Constitution, with the original 13 states forming the first Articles of
   Confederation, and later the aforementioned Constitution. Within the
   U.S. constitution are provisions as to the formation of new states
   within the Union.

   Structured in accordance with state law (including state constitutions
   and state statutes), state governments share the same structural model
   as the federal system, with three branches of governmentâ€”executive,
   legislative, and judicial.

   Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, all
   governmental powers not granted to the federal government by the
   Constitution are reserved for the states or to the people.

   The governments of the 13 colonies that formed the original union under
   the Constitution trace their history back to the royal charters which
   established them during the era of colonialism. Most other states were
   organized as federal territories or parts of other states before
   forming their governments and requesting admittance into the union.
   Notable exceptions are Texas and Hawaii, which were sovereign nations
   before joining the union.

Legislatures[edit]

   See also: List of U.S. state legislatures

   The legislative branch of the U.S. states consists of state
   legislatures. Every state except for Nebraska has a bicameral
   legislature, meaning it comprises two chambers.

   The unicameral Nebraska Legislature is commonly called the "Senate",
   and its members are officially called "Senators".

   In the majority of states (26), the state legislature is simply called
   "Legislature." Another 19 states call their legislature "General
   Assembly". Two states (Oregon and North Dakota) use the term
   "Legislative Assembly", while another two (Massachusetts and New
   Hampshire) use the term "General Court".

Upper Houses[edit]

   In the 49 bicameral legislatures, the upper house is called the
   "Senate".

   Until 1964, state senators were generally elected from districts that
   were not necessarily equal in population. In some cases state senate
   districts were based partly on county lines; in the vast majority of
   states the senate districts provided proportionately greater
   representation to rural areas. However, in the 1964 decision Reynolds
   v. Sims, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, unlike the United States
   Senate, state senates must be elected from districts of approximately
   equal population.

Lower Houses[edit]

   In 40 of the 49 bicameral state legislatures, the lower house is called
   the "House of Representatives". The name "House of Delegates" is used
   in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. California and Wisconsin call
   their lower house the "State Assembly", while Nevada and New York
   simply call the lower house the "Assembly". New Jersey calls its lower
   house the "General Assembly".

Executive[edit]

   The executive branch of every state is headed by an elected Governor.
   Most states have a plural executive, in which several key members of
   the executive branch are directly elected by the people and serve
   alongside the governor. These include the offices of lieutenant
   governor (often on a joint ticket with the governor) and attorney
   general, secretary of state, auditors (or comptrollers or controllers),
   treasurer, commissioner of agriculture, commissioner (or
   superintendent) of education, and commissioner of insurance.

   Each state government is free to organize its executive departments and
   agencies in any way it likes. This has resulted in substantial
   diversity among the states with regard to every aspect of how their
   governments are organized.

   Most state governments traditionally use the department as the standard
   highest-level component of the executive branch, in that the secretary
   of a department is normally considered to be a member of the governor's
   cabinet and serves as the main interface between the governor and all
   agencies in his or her assigned portfolio. A department in turn usually
   consists of several divisions, offices, and/or agencies. A state
   government may also include various boards, commissions, councils,
   corporations, offices, or authorities, which may either be subordinate
   to an existing department or division, or independent altogether.

   A few of the most populous or oldest states have run into serious
   administrative problems because they promoted too many important
   government functions from divisions to departments (usually in response
   to whatever was the biggest scandal at the time), thereby expanding the
   governor's cabinet to an unwieldy size. Rather than adopt the sensible
   (but politically radioactive) solution of demoting some departments
   back to divisions, those states created another level above departments
   and limited cabinet membership to the officers appointed at that level.
   California created "agencies" (also called "superagencies" by
   government insiders to distinguish them from the general usage of the
   term "agency"), while Massachusetts created "executive offices."

Judiciary[edit]

   The judicial branch in most states is topped by a court of last resort
   usually called a supreme court that hears appeals from lower state
   courts. Oddly, New York's highest court is called the Court of Appeals,
   while its trial court is known as the Supreme Court. Maryland also
   calls its highest court the Court of Appeals. Texas and Oklahoma each
   separate courts of last resort for civil and criminal appeals. Each
   state's court has the last word on issues of state law and can only be
   overruled by federal courts on issues of Constitutional law.

   The structure of courts and the methods of selecting judges is
   determined by each state's constitution or legislature. Most states
   have at least one trial-level court and an intermediate appeals court
   from which only some cases are appealed to the highest court.
