   history of the United States.

   The economic history of the United States is about characteristics of
   and important developments in the U.S. economy from colonial times to
   the present.

   The emphasis is on economic performance and how it was affected by new
   technologies, the change in size of economic sectors and the effects of
   legislation and government policy.

Colonial economy[edit]

   The colonial economy of what would become the United States was
   primarily characterized by subsistence farming. The market economy was
   based on high valve agricultural products, natural resource extraction
   and processing and export related businesses. The largest
   non-agricultural segment was ship building, which was from 5 to 20% of
   total employment.^[1] Exports and related services accounted for about
   one-sixth of income in the decade before revolution.^[2] Just before
   the revolution, tobacco was about a quarter of the value of exports.
   Also at the time of the revolution the colonies produced about 15% of
   world iron.^[3] The mined American iron ores at that time were not
   large deposits and were not all of high quality; however, the huge
   forests provided adequate wood for making charcoal. Wood in Britain was
   becoming scarce and coke was beginning to be substituted for charcoal;
   however, coke made inferior iron.^[4] Britain banned construction of
   new colonial iron foundries in 1750, but the ban was mostly ignored by
   the colonists.^[5]

   Settlement was sparse during the colonial period and transportation was
   severely limited by lack of roads; consequently most towns were located
   on the coasts or navigable inland waterways. Even on improved roads,
   which were rare during the colonial period, wagon transport was very
   expensive. Economical distance for transporting low value agricultural
   commodities to navigable waterways varied but was limited to something
   on the order of less than 25 miles.^[6] In the few small cities and
   among the larger plantations of South Carolina, and Virginia, some
   necessities and virtually all luxuries were imported in return for
   tobacco, rice, and indigo exports.^[7]

   Some colonies, such as Virginia, were founded principally as business
   ventures. England's success at colonizing what would become the United
   States was due in large part to its use of charter companies. Charter
   companies were groups of stockholders (usually merchants and wealthy
   landowners) who sought personal economic gain and, perhaps, wanted also
   to advance England's national goals. While the private sector financed
   the companies, the King also provided each project with a charter or
   grant conferring economic rights as well as political and judicial
   authority. The colonies generally did not show quick profits, however,
   and the English investors often turned over their colonial charters to
   the settlers. The political implications, although not realized at the
   time, were enormous. The colonists were left to build their own lives,
   their own communities, and their own economy.

   Small local industries emerged as the colonies grew, such as sawmills,
   and gristmills. Entrepreneurs established shipyards to build fishing
   fleets and, in time, trading vessels and built iron forges. By the 18th
   century, regional patterns of development had become clear: the New
   England colonies relied on shipbuilding and sailing to generate wealth;
   plantations (many using slave labor) in Maryland, Virginia, and the
   Carolinas grew tobacco, rice, and indigo; and the middle colonies of
   New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware shipped general crops
   and furs. Except for slaves, standards of living were generally
   high—higher, in fact, than in England itself.^[8]

The colonial economy of New England[edit]

   The New England region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial
   era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the
   provinces and many towns as well, tried to foster economic growth by
   subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads,
   bridges, inns and ferries. They gave bounties and subsidies or
   monopolies to sawmills, grist mills, iron mills, pulling mills (which
   treated cloth), salt works and glassworks. Most important, colonial
   legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business
   enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting
   property rights. Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the
   region, as the Puritans and Yankees endorsed the "Protestant Ethic",
   which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling.^[9]

   The benefits of growth were widely distributed in New England, reaching
   from merchants to farmers to hired laborers. The rapidly growing
   population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families
   could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and
   another was to move to new lands farther west. In the towns and cities,
   there was strong entrepreneurship, and a steady increase in the
   specialization of labor. Wages for men went up steadily before 1775;
   new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching,
   and tailoring. The region bordered New France, and in the numerous wars
   the British poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads and pay
   colonial soldiers. The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing,
   international trade and shipbuilding—and after 1780 in whaling.
   Combined with growing urban markets for farm products, these factors
   allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological
   innovation.^[10]

The American Revolution and the new nation[edit]

Political developments[edit]

The American Revolution[edit]

   Americans in the Thirteen Colonies demanded their rights as Englishmen,
   as they saw it, to select their own representatives to govern and tax
   them – which Britain refused. The Americans attempted resistance
   through boycotts of British manufactured items, but the British
   responded with a rejection of American rights and the Intolerable Acts
   of 1774.^[11] In turn, the Americans launched the American Revolution,
   resulting in an all-out war against the British and to independence for
   the new United States of America. The British tried to crush the
   American economy with a blockade of all ports, but with 90% of the
   people in farming, and only 10% in cities, the American economy proved
   resilient and able to support a sustained war, which lasted from 1775
   to 1783.^[12]

   (symbolizing a break from British commerce) with a distressed
   Englishman watching as other European powers wait to collect milk. The
   cartoon represents the commercial status of the US during the
   Revolution.

   The American Revolution (1775–1783) brought a dedication to unalienable
   rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness", which
   emphasize individual liberty and economic entrepreneurship, and
   simultaneously a commitment to the political values of liberalism and
   republicanism, which emphasize natural rights, equality under the law
   for all citizens, civic virtue and duty, and promotion of the general
   welfare.

   Britain's war against the Americans, French and Spanish cost about
   £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money it needed and
   raised the rest through an efficient system of taxation.^[13]^[14]
   Heavy spending brought France to the verge of bankruptcy and
   revolution.

   Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the
   war.^[15] In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the
   colonies, not nearly enough to cover existing transactions, let alone
   on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a
   tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports
   and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from
   militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay
   actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency,
   and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the
   soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they
   had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when
   Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States,
   did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters.
   Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North
   America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced
   the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts,
   tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's
   full share of money and supplies from the states.^[16]

   Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which
   cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).^[17]
   Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775–1780, and in 1780–81.
   The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would
   supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually
   paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the
   paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said, and a second
   issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became
   nearly worthless—but it was redeemed by the new federal government in
   1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states,
   especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200 million dollars
   of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on
   the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was
   possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the
   few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were
   farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors
   benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.^[18] The
   greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army,
   whose wages—usually in arrears—declined in value every month, weakening
   their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.

   Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from
   wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The
   bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme
   raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of
   the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the
   French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder and
   munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France
   officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the
   French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned
   large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full
   in the 1790s.^[19]

   Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide
   money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little
   help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of
   corn, beef, pork and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept
   the army barely alive.^[20]^[21]

The New Nation[edit]

   Chart 1: trends in economic growth, 1700–1850

   The U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1787, established that the entire
   nation was a unified, or common market, with no internal tariffs or
   taxes on interstate commerce. The extent of federal power was much
   debated, with Alexander Hamilton taking a very broad view as the first
   secretary of the treasury during the presidential administration of
   George Washington. Hamilton successfully argued for the concept of
   "implied powers", whereby the federal government was authorized by the
   Constitution to create anything necessary to support its contents, even
   if it not specifically noted in it (build lighthouses, etc.). He
   succeeded in building strong national credit based on taking over the
   state debts and bundling them with the old national debt into new
   securities sold to the wealthy. They in turn now had an interest in
   keeping the new government solvent. Hamilton funded the debt with
   tariffs on imported goods and a highly controversial tax on whiskey.
   Hamilton believed the United States should pursue economic growth
   through diversified shipping, manufacturing, and banking. He sought and
   achieved Congressional authority to create the First Bank of the United
   States in 1791; the charter lasted until 1811.^[22]

Industry and commerce[edit]

Transportation[edit]

   In 1792 it was reported that the cost of transport of many crops to
   seaport was from one-fifth to one half their cost. Others were shut off
   because of the high cost of transport.^[23]

Automatic flour mill[edit]

   In the mid 1780s Oliver Evans invented a fully automatic mill that
   could process grain with practically no human labor or operator
   attention. This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used
   bucket elevators and conveyor belts, which would eventually
   revolutionize materials handling, and 2) it used governors, a
   forerunner of modern automation, for control.

Cotton gin[edit]

   "The First Cotton Gin" conjectural image from 1869

   Cotton, at first a small-scale crop in the South, boomed following Eli
   Whitney's invention in 1793 of the cotton gin, a machine that separated
   raw cotton from seeds and other waste. The cotton gin (abbreviation of
   engine) increased the productivity of separating seed from fiber by a
   factor of 50, enabling a man to de-seed as much cotton in a day as a
   woman could do in two months, at the rate of one pound per day. Soon,
   large plantations, based on slave labor, expanded in the richest lands
   from the Carolinas westward to Texas. The raw cotton was shipped to
   textile mills in Britain, France and New England.^[24]

Mechanized textile manufacturing[edit]

   In the final decade of the 18th century England was beginning to enter
   the rapid growth period of the Industrial Revolution, but the rest of
   the world was completely devoid of any type of large scale mechanized
   industry. Britain prohibited the export of textile machinery and
   designs and dis not allow mechanics with such skills to emigrate.
   Samuel Slater (1768–1835) popularly called "The Father of the American
   Industrial Revolution"

   Samuel Slater, who worked as mechanic at a cotton spinning operation in
   England, memorized the design of the machinery. He was able to disguise
   himself as a laborer and emigrated to the U.S., where he heard there
   was a demand for his knowledge. In 1789 Slater began working as a
   consultant to Almy & Brown in Rhode Island who were trying to
   successfully spin cotton on some equipment they had recently purchased.
   Slater determined that the machinery was not capable of producing good
   quality yarn and persuaded the owners to have him design new machinery.
   Slater found no mechanics in the U.S. when he arrived and had great
   difficulty finding someone to build the machinery.^[25] Eventually he
   located Oziel Wilkinson and his son David to produce iron castings and
   forgings for the machinery. According to David Wilkinson: “all the
   turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by Mr. Slater was
   done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand
   power”. By 1791 Slater had some of the equipment operating. In 1793
   Slater and Brown opened a factory in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, which was
   the first successful water powered roller spinning cotton factory in
   the U.S. See: Slater Mill Historic Site David Wilkinson went on to
   invent a metalworking lathe which won him a Congressional prize.

The early 19th century[edit]

Agriculture, commerce and industry[edit]

Labor shortage[edit]

   The U.S. economy of the 19th century was characterized by labor
   shortages, as noted by numerous contemporary observers. The labor
   shortage was attributed to the cheapness of land and the high returns
   on agriculture. All types of labor were in high demand, especially
   unskilled labor and experienced factory workers. Labor prices in the
   U.S. were typically from 30-50% higher than in Britain. Women factory
   workers were especially scarce. The elasticity of labor was low in part
   because of lack of transportation and low population density. The
   relative labor scarcity and high price was an incentive for capital
   investment, particularly in machinery.^[26]

Agriculture[edit]

   The U.S. economy was primarily agricultural in the early 19th century.
   Westward expansion plus the building of canals and the introduction of
   steamboats opened up new areas for agriculture. Much land was cleared
   and put into growing cotton in the Mississippi valley and in Alabama,
   and new grain growing areas were brought into production in the Mid
   West. Eventually this put severe downward pressure on prices,
   particularly of cotton, first from 1820–23 and again from 1840-43. The
   cotton trade, excluding financing, transport and marketing, was 6% of
   less of national income in the 1830s.^[27]

   Sugar cane was being grown in Louisiana, where it was refined into
   granular sugar. Growing and refining sugar required a large amount of
   capital. Some of the nation's wealthiest people owned sugar
   plantations, which often had their own sugar mills.

Roads[edit]

   There were only a few roads outside of cities at the beginning of the
   19th century, but turnpikes were being built. A ton-mile by wagon cost
   from between 30 and 70 cents in 1819. Robert Fulton's estimate for
   typical wagonage was 32 cents per ton-mile. The cost of transporting
   wheat or corn to Philadelphia exceeded the value at 218 and 135 miles,
   respectively.^[28]

   To facilitate westward expansion, in 1801 Thomas Jefferson began work
   on the Natchez Trace, which was to connect Daniel Boone's Wilderness
   Road, which ended in Nashville, Tennessee, with the Mississippi River.

   Following the Louisiana Purchase the need for additional roads to the
   West were recognized by Thomas Jefferson, who authorized the
   construction of the Cumberland Road in 1806. The Cumberland Road was to
   connect Cumberland Maryland on the Potomac River with the Wheeling
   (West) Virginia on the Ohio River, which was on the other side of the
   Alleghany Mountains. Mail roads were also built to New Orleans.

   The building of roads in the early years of the 19th century greatly
   lowered transportation cost and were a factor in the deflation of
   1819-21, which was one of the most severe in U. S. history.^[28]

   Some turnpikes were wooden plank roads, which typically cost about
   $1,500 1o $1800 per mile, but wore out quickly. Macadam roads in New
   York cost an average of $3,500 per mile,^[29] while high quality roads
   cost between $5,000 and $10,000 per mile.

Canals[edit]

   Scene of Lockport on the Erie Canal (W. H. Bartlett 1839)

   Because a horse can pull a barge weighing 50 tons compared to the
   typical one ton or less hauled by wagon, and the horse required a
   wagoner versus a couple of men for the barge, water transportation
   costs were a small fraction of wagonage costs. Canals shipping cost
   were between two and three cents per ton mile, compared to over 30
   cents by wagon.^[3] The cost of constructing a typical canal was
   between $20,000 and $30,000.^[30]

   Only 100 miles of canals had been built in the U.S. by 1816, and only a
   few were longer than two miles. The early canals were typically
   financially successful, such as those carrying coal in eastern
   Pennsylvania.

   The 325 mile Erie Canal, which connected Albany, New York on the Hudson
   River with Buffalo, New York on Lake Erie, began operation in 1825.
   Cost per ton-mile from Buffalo to New York City was in 1817 was 19.2
   cents. By Erie Canal ca. 1857-60 the cost was 0.81 cents.^[31] The Erie
   Canal was a great commercial success and had a had a large regional
   economic impact.

   The Delaware and Raritan Canal was also very successful. Also
   tremendously successful was the 2.5 mile canal bypassing the falls on
   the Ohio River at Louisville, which opened in 1830.^[32]

   The success of some of the early canals led to canal building boom,
   during which work began on many canals which would prove to be
   financially unsuccessful. As the canal boom was underway in the late
   1820s, a small number of horse railways were being built. These were
   quickly followed by the first steam railways in the 1830s.

Steam power[edit]

   In 1780 the U.S. had three steam engines, all of which were used for
   pumping water: two in mines and one for New York City's water supply.
   Most power in the United States was supplied by water wheels (and water
   turbines during after 1840). By 1807 when the steamboat Clermont first
   sailed, there were estimated to be fewer than a dozen steam engines
   operating in the U. S. Steam power did not overtake water power in the
   U. S. until sometime after 1850.^[33]

   Oliver Evans began developing a high pressure steam engine that was
   more practical than the engine developed around the same time by
   Richard Trevithick in England. The high pressure engine did away with
   the separate condenser (invented by James Watt) and thus did not
   require cooling water. It also had a higher power to weight ratio,
   making it suitable for powering steamboats and locomotives. Evans
   produced a few custom steam engines from 1801 to 1806, when he opened
   the Mars Works foundry and factory near Philadelphia, where he produced
   additional engines. In 1812 he produced his successful Colombian engine
   at Mars. As his business grew and orders were being shipped inland,
   Evans and a partner formed the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company in
   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Steam engines soon became common in public
   water supply, sawmills and flour milling, especially in areas where
   there was no water power.

Mechanical power transmission[edit]

   In 1828 Paul Mody substituted leather belting for gearing in mills.
   Leather belting continued in use until it was displaced by unit drive
   electric motors in the early decades of the 20th century.^[34]

Steamboats and steam ships[edit]

   Commercial steamboat operations began in 1807 within weeks of the
   launch of Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat, often referred to as
   the Clermont.

   The first steamboats were powered by Boulton and Watt type low pressure
   engines, which were very large and heavy in relation to the smaller
   high pressure engines. In 1807-8 Robert L. Stevens began operation of
   the Phoenix, which used a high pressure engine in combination with a
   low pressure condensing engine. The first steamboats powered only by
   high pressure were the Aetna and Pennsylvania designed and built by
   Oliver Evans.^[35]

   In the winter of 1811-1812, the New Orleans became the first steamboat
   to travel down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers from Pittsburgh to New
   Orleans.

   By the time of Fulton's death in 1815 he operated 21 of the estimated
   30 steamboats in the U.S. The number of steamboats steadily grew into
   the hundreds. There were more steamboats in the Mississippi valley than
   anywhere else in the world.^[36]

   Early steamboats took 30 days to travel from New Orleans to Louisville,
   which was from half to one-quarter the time by keel boat. Due to
   improvements in steamboat technology, by 1830 the time from New Orleans
   to Louisville was halved. In 1820 freight rates for keel boats were 5
   cents versus 2 cents by steamboat, falling to one-half cent per pound
   by 1830.^[37]

   The SS Savannah crossed from Savannah to Liverpool in 1919 as the first
   trans-Atlantic steamship; however, until the development of more
   efficient engines, trans-ocean ships had to carry more coal than
   freight. Early trans-ocean steamships were used for passengers and soon
   some companies began offering regularly scheduled service.

Railroads[edit]

   Horse railways began being built early in the 19th century, but in the
   1830s steam locomotive technology had evolved to the point they were
   viable.

   The steam railways of the 1830s mostly connected east coast cities or
   connected to navigable waterways and primarily handled freight rather
   than passengers.^[38]

   A typical mile of railroad cost $30,000 compared to the $20,000 per
   mile of canal, but a railroad could carry 50 times as much traffic.
   Railroads came a the time of the canal boom with several canals under
   construction, causing many completed and construction stage canals to
   fail.

   The first locomotives were imported from England. One such locomotive
   was the John Bull which arrived in 1831. While awaiting assembly,
   Matthias W. Baldwin, who had designed and manufactured a highly
   successful stationary steam engine, was able to inspect the parts and
   obtain measurements. Baldwin was already working on an experimental
   locomotive based on designs shown at the Rainhill Trials in England.
   Baldwin produced his first locomotive in 1832, but it performed poorly,
   although it was subsequently improved. Baldwin went on to found the
   Baldwin Locomotive Works, one of the largest steam locomotive
   manufacturers.

   In 1833 when there were few locomotives in the U.S., three quarters
   were made in England. In 1838 there were 346 locomotives recorded in
   the U.S., three fourths of which were made in the U.S.^[39]

   Ohio had more railroads built in the 1840s than any other state. Ohio’s
   railroads put the canals out of business.^[40]

Manufacturing[edit]

   The U. S. textile industry was able to become established during the
   long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when trade with Europe was
   either difficult or prohibited, as in the case of the Embargo Act of
   1807, which lasted from December 1807 to March 1809. The embargo was
   responsible for an increase in capital investment in machinery^[41] and
   helped the establishment of mechanical trades in the U.S.
   Boston Manufacturing Co., Waltham, Massachusetts

   By the time of the Embargo Act of 1807 there here were 15 cotton
   spinning mills in operation in the U. S. These were all small
   operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used
   Arckwright water frames powered by small streams. They were all located
   in southeastern New England.^[42] In 1809 the number of mills had grown
   to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth
   several manufacturers resorted to the putting-out system of having the
   handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient
   because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the
   cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality.
   To overcome these problems the textile manufacturers began to
   consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise
   operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 Francis Cabot Lowell
   of the Boston Manufacturing Company built the first integrated spinning
   and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans
   for a power loom that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest
   factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very
   efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the Tariff of
   1816, competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many
   smaller operations were being forced out of business.

   The U.S. began exporting textiles in the 1830s. Cloth production became
   the major industry in the U.S.^[41]

   The shoe industry began transitioning from production by craftsmen to
   the factory system, with division of labor.^[43]

   Low return freight rates from Europe offered little protection from
   imports to domestic industries.^[44]

Finance, money and banking[edit]

   In order to dampen speculation in land, Andrew Jackson signed the
   executive order known as the Specie Circular in 1836, requiring sale of
   government land to be paid in gold and silver. Branch mints at New
   Orleans, Dahlonega, Georgia and Charlotte North Carolina were
   authorized by congress in 1835 and became operational in 1838.

   The charter of the Second Bank of the United States expired in January
   1836. Gold was being withdrawn from the U. S. by England and silver had
   also been taken out of the country because it had been under valued
   relative to gold by the Coinage Act of 1834. Canal projects began to
   fail. The result was the financial Panic of 1837. In 1838 there was a
   brief recovery.

   The aftermath of the canal failures, the Panic of 1837 and the collapse
   in agricultural commodity prices, particularly cotton prices, were all
   factors in the depression that lasted from 1839-1943. The timing for
   cotton was made worse by the saturation of the cotton textile market at
   the ending stage of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The
   depression was one of the most severe in the nation's history.^[45]
   See: For additional information see Historical examples of credit
   deflation

   Despite the deflation and depression, GDP rose 16% from 1839-43.^[3]

Development of interchangeable parts[edit]

   The experience of this War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a
   request for contract proposals for firearms with interchangeable parts.
   Previously, parts from one firearm had to be carefully hand-fitted to
   another firearm; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an
   artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The
   requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of
   modern metal-working machine tools, including milling machines,
   grinders, shapers and planers. The Federal Armories perfected the use
   of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts
   being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper
   path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the
   accuracy and precision of the machined parts. Developing the
   manufacturing techniques for making interchangeable parts by the
   Federal Armories took over two decades. The mechanists' skills were
   called armory practice and the system eventually became known as the
   American system of manufacturing. Mechanists from the armories
   eventually spread the concepts to other industries, such as clocks and
   watches, especially in the New England area.

   The development of these modern machine tools and machining practices
   made possible the development of modern industry capable of mass
   production.^[46]^[47]^[48]^[49]

Political developments[edit]

   The institutional arrangements of the American System were initially
   formulated by first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, who
   proposed the creation of a government-sponsored bank and increased
   tariffs to encourage industrial development.^[50] Following Hamilton's
   death at the hands of Aaron Burr, the American school of political
   economy was championed in the antebellum period by Henry Clay and the
   Whig Party (United States) generally.^[51]

   Thomas Jefferson was able to purchase the Louisiana Territory from
   France in 1803 for $15 million, although the treasury at the time only
   had $10 million. The Louisiana Purchase greatly expanded the size of
   the United States, adding extremely good farmland, the Mississippi
   River and the city of New Orleans.

   Specific government programs and policies which gave shape and form to
   the American School and the American System include the establishment
   of the Patent Office in 1802; the creation of the Coast and Geodetic
   Survey in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor
   navigation; the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with
   Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the
   1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army
   Corps of Topographical Engineers, and which provided crucial
   information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of
   Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and
   construction of the early railroads and canals; the establishment of
   the First Bank of the United States and Second Bank of the United
   States as well as various protectionist measures (e.g., the tariff of
   1828).

   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison opposed a strong central government
   (and, consequently, most of Hamilton's economic policies), but they
   could not stop Hamilton, who wielded immense power and political clout
   in the Washington administration. In 1801, however, Jefferson became
   president and turned to promoting a more decentralized, agrarian
   democracy called Jeffersonian democracy. (He based his philosophy on
   protecting the common man from political and economic tyranny. He
   particularly praised small farmers as "the most valuable citizens".)
   However, Jefferson did not change Hamilton's basic policies. As
   president in 1811 Madison let the bank charter expire, but the War of
   1812 proved the need for a national bank and Madison reversed
   positions. The Second Bank of the United States was established in
   1816, with a 20-year charter.^[52]

   Wars from 1793-1814 caused withdrawal of most foreign shipping from the
   U.S., leaving trade in the Caribbean and Central and South America open
   for the U.S. Seizure of U.S. ships by France and Britain during the
   Napoleonic Wars led to the Embargo Act of 1807 which prohibited most
   foreign trade.^[53] The War of 1812, by cutting off almost all foreign
   trade, created a home market for goods made in the U.S. (even if they
   were more expensive), changing an early tendency toward free trade into
   a protectionism characterized by nationalism and protective
   tariffs.^[54]

   States built roads and waterways, such as the Cumberland Pike (1818)
   and the Erie Canal (1825), opening up markets for western farm
   products. The Whig Party supported Clay's American System, which
   proposed to build internal improvements (e.g. roads, canals and
   harbors), protect industry, and create a strong national bank. The Whig
   legislation program was blocked at the national level by the Democrats,
   but similar modernization programs were enacted in most states on a
   bipartisan basis.^[55]

   President Andrew Jackson (1829–1837), leader of the new Democratic
   Party, opposed the Second Bank of the United States, which he believed
   favored the entrenched interests of rich. When he was elected for a
   second term, Jackson blocked the renewal of the bank's charter. Jackson
   opposed paper money and demanded the government be paid in gold and
   silver coins. The Panic of 1837 stopped business growth for three
   years.^[56]

Railroads[edit]

   Main article: Rail transportation in the United States

   Railroads opened up remote areas and drastically cut the cost of moving
   freight and passengers. By 1860 long distance bulk rates had fallen by
   95%, less than of which was due to the general fall in prices.^[58]
   This large fall in transportation costs created "a major revolution in
   domestic commerce."^[59]

   As transportation improved, new markets continuously opened. Railroads
   greatly increased the importance of hub cities such as Atlanta,
   Billings, Chicago, and Dallas.^[60]

   Railroads were a highly capital intensive business, with a typical cost
   of $30,000 per mile with a considerable range depending on terrain and
   other factors.^[36] Private capital for Railroads during the period
   from 1830-60 was inadequate. States awarded charters, funding, tax
   breaks, land grants, and provided some financing. Railroads were
   allowed banking privileges and lotteries in some states. Private
   investors provided a small but not insignificant share or railroad
   capital.^[61] A combination of domestic and foreign investment along
   with the discovery of gold and a major commitment of America's public
   and private wealth, enabled the nation to develop a large-scale
   railroad system, establishing the base for the country's
   industrialization.

   Railroad executives invented modern methods for running large-scale
   business operations, creating a blueprint that all large corporations
   basically followed. They created career tracks that took 18-year-old
   boys and turned them into brakemen, conductors and engineers.^[62] They
   were first to encounter managerial complexities, labor union issues,
   and problems of geographical competition. Due to these radical
   innovations, the railroad became the first large-scale business
   enterprise and the model for most large corporations.^[63]

Iron industry[edit]

   The most important technological innovation in mid 19th century pig
   iron production was the adoption of hot blast, which was developed and
   patented in Scotland in 1828. Hot blast is a method of using heat from
   the blast furnace exhaust gas to preheat combustion air, saving a
   considerable amount of fuel. It allowed much higher furnace
   temperatures and increased the capacity of furnaces.

   Hot blast allowed blast furnaces to use anthracite or lower grade coal.
   Anthracite was difficult to light with cold blast. High quality
   metallurgical coking coal deposits of sufficient size for iron making
   were only available in Great Britain and western Germany in the 19th
   century,^[64] but with less fuel required per unit of iron, there were
   proportionately fewer contaminants.

   The use of anthracite was rather short lived because the size of blast
   furnaces increased enormously toward the end of the century, forcing
   the use of coke, which was more porous and did not impede the upflow of
   the gases through the furnace. Charcoal would have been crushed by the
   column of material in tall furnaces. Also, the capacity of furnaces
   would have eventually exceeded the wood supply, as happened with
   locomotives.^[65]

   Charcoal production was very labor and land intensive. It was estimated
   that to fuel a typical sized 100 ton of pig iron per weed furnace in
   1833 at a sustained yield, timber plantations required 20,000 acres.
   The trees had to be hauled by oxen to where they were cut, stacked on
   end and covered with earth or put in a kiln to be charred for about a
   week. Anthracite reduced labor cost to $2.50 per ton compared to
   charcoal at $15.50 per ton.^[66]^[67]

   Iron was used for a wide variety of purposes. In 1860 large consumers
   were numerous types of castings, especially stoves. Of the $32 million
   of bar, sheet and railroad iron produced, slightly less than half was
   railroad iron. The value added by stoves was equal to the value added
   by rails.^[41]

Manufacturing[edit]

   Manufacturing became well established during the mid 19th century.
   Labor in the U.S. was expensive and industry made every effort to
   economize by using machinery.^[46] Woodworking machinery such as
   circular saws, high speed lathes, planers and mortising machines and
   various other machines amazed the British as was reported by Joseph
   Whitworth.^[68] See: American system of manufacturing#Use of machinery

   In the early 19th century machinery was made mostly of wood with iron
   parts. By the mid century machines were being increasingly of all iron,
   which made allowed them to operate at higher speeds and with higher
   precision. The demand for machinery created a machine tool industry
   that designed and manufactured lathes, metal planers, shapers and other
   precision metal cutting tools.^[69]

   The shoe industry was the second to be mechanized, beginning in the
   1840s. Sewing machines were developed for sewing leather. A leather
   rolling machine eliminated hand hammering, and was thirty times faster.
   Another Blanchard lathes began being used for making shoe lasts (forms)
   in the 1850s, allowing the manufacture of standard sizes.^[43]

   By the 1850s much progress had been made in the development of the
   sewing machine, with a few companies making the machines, based on a
   number of patents, with no company controlling the right combination of
   patents to make a superior machine. To prevent damaging lawsuits, in
   1856 several important patents were pooled under the Sewing Machine
   Combination, which licensed the patents for a fixed fee per machine
   sold.

   The sewing machine industry was a beneficiary of machine tools and the
   manufacturing methods developed at the Federal Armories. By 1860 two
   sewing machine manufacturers were using interchangeable parts.^[46]

   The sewing machine increased the productivity of sewing cloth by a
   factor of 5.

Steam power[edit]

   The Corliss steam engine, patented in 1848, was called the most
   significant development in steam engineering since James Watt. The
   Corliss engine was more efficient than previous engines and maintained
   more uniform speed in response to load changes, making it suitable for
   a wide variety of industrial applications. It was the first steam
   engine that was suitable for cotton spinning.

   Steam power greatly expanded during the late 19th century with the rise
   of large factories, the expanded railroad network and early electric
   lighting and electric street railways.

Ships[edit]

   Until the introduction of iron ships, the U. S. made the best in the
   world. The design of U.S. ships required fewer crew members to operate.
   U.S. made ships cost from 40% to 60% as much as European ships, and
   lasted longer.^[70]

   The screw propeller was tested on Lake Ontario in 1841 before being
   used on ocean ships.^[71] Propellers began being used on Great Lakes
   ships in 1845.^[72] Propellers caused vibrations which were a problem
   for wooden ships.^[73] The SS Great Britain, launched in 1845, was the
   first iron ship with a screw propeller. Iron ships became common and
   more efficient multiple expansion engines were developed. After the
   introduction of iron ships, Britain became the leading shipbuilding
   country.

Telegraph[edit]

   Congress approved funds for a short demonstration telegraph line from
   Baltimore to Washington D.C., which was operational in 1844. The
   telegraph was quickly adopted by the railroad industry, which needed
   rapid communication to coordinate train schedules, the importance of
   which had been highlighted by a train collision in 1841. Railroads also
   needed to communicate over over a vast network in order to keep track
   of freight and equipment.^[74] Consequently, railroads installed
   telegraphs lines on their existing right of ways. By 1852 there were
   22,000 miles of telegraph lines in the U.S.,compared to 10,000 miles of
   track.^[75]

Urbanization[edit]

   By 1860, on the eve of Civil War, 16% of the people lived in cities
   with 2500 or more people and one third of the nation's income came from
   manufacturing. Urbanized industry was limited primarily to the
   Northeast; cotton cloth production was the leading industry, with the
   manufacture of shoes, woolen clothing, and machinery also expanding.
   Most of the workers in the new factories were immigrants or their
   children. Between 1845 and 1855, some 300,000 European immigrants
   arrived annually. Many remained in eastern cities, especially mill
   towns and mining camps, while those with farm experience and some
   savings bought farms in the West.^[76]

Agriculture[edit]

   horses.
   Adriance reaper, late 19th century

   The westward expansion into the highly productive heartland was timely
   for supporting the rapidly growing domestic population and to
   capitalize on high grain prices caused by poor harvests in Europe
   during the time of the Great Famine in Ireland^[53] Grain prices also
   rose during the Crimean War.

   Agriculture was the largest single industry and it prospered during the
   war.^[77]^[78] Prices were high, pulled up by a strong demand from the
   army and from Britain, which depended on American wheat for a fourth of
   its food imports.

   John Deere developed a cast steel plow in 1837 which was lightweight
   and had a moldboard that efficiently turned over and shed the plowed
   earth. It was easy for a horse to pull and was well adapted to cutting
   the thick prairie sod of the Midwest. He and his brother Charles
   founded Deere and Company which continues into the 21st century as the
   largest maker of tractors, combines, harvesters and other farm
   implements.^[79]^[80]

   Threshing machines, which were a novelty at the end of the 18th
   century, began being widely introduced in the 1830s and 1840s.
   Mechanized threshing required less than half the labor of hand
   threshing.^[81]^[82]

   The war acted as a catalyst that encouraged the rapid adoption of
   horse-drawn machinery and other implements. The rapid spread of recent
   inventions such as the reaper and mower made the work force efficient,
   even as hundreds of thousands of farmers were in the army.^[83] Many
   wives took their place, and often consulted by mail on what to do;
   increasingly they relied on community and extended kin for advice and
   help.^[84]

   The 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land
   grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms
   (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the
   government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the
   latest techniques through the newly established Department of
   Agriculture and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.^[85]

Collapse of South[edit]

   See also: Economy of the Confederate States of America

   The wartime devastation of the South was great and poverty ensued;
   incomes of whites dropped, but income of the former slaves rose. During
   Reconstruction railroad construction was heavily subsidized (with much
   corruption), but the region maintained its dependence on cotton. Former
   slaves became wage laborers, tenant farmers, or sharecroppers. They
   were joined by many poor whites, as the population grew faster than the
   economy. As late as 1940 the only significant manufacturing industries
   were textile mills (mostly in the upland Carolinas) and some steel in
   Alabama.^[86]

   The industrial advantages of the North over the South helped secure a
   Northern victory in the American Civil War (1861–1865). The Northern
   victory sealed the destiny of the nation and its economic system. The
   slave-labor system was abolished; the world price of cotton plunged,
   making the large southern cotton plantations much less profitable.
   Northern industry, which had expanded rapidly before and during the
   war, surged ahead. Industrialists came to dominate many aspects of the
   nation's life, including social and political affairs.^[76]

Political developments[edit]

   From the 1830s to 1860, Congress repeatedly rejected Whig calls for
   higher tariffs, and its policies of Economic nationalism, which
   included increased state control, regulation and macroeconomic
   development of infrastructure.^[87] President Andrew Jackson, for
   example, destroyed the Second Bank of the United States. The tariff was
   lowered time and again before the Civil War. Proposals to fund massive
   western railroad projects, or to give free land to homesteaders, were
   defeated by Southerners afraid these policies would strengthen the
   North. The Civil War changed everything.

Treasury[edit]

   In 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale
   operations of the government through the low tariff and land
   sales.^[88] Revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a
   full-scale war, but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P.
   Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling
   the economy.^[89] Many new taxes were imposed, and always with a
   patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of
   life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which
   encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their
   politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when
   it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their
   horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the
   Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and
   turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system
   impoverished its patriots.^[90]

   The United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and
   fleets raised to fight the Civil War — over $400 million just in
   1862.^[91] The largest tax sum by far came from new excise taxes—a sort
   of value added tax—that was imposed on every sort of manufactured item.
   Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill tariff laws.
   Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it
   was repealed at war's end.

   Apart from taxes, the second major source was government bonds. For the
   first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the
   people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by
   banker Jay Cooke. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only
   national banks could do that, and Chase made it easy to become a
   national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and
   financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the
   first one in each city was the "First National Bank".^[92] Fourth the
   government printed "greenbacks"—paper money—which were controversial
   because they caused inflation.

   Secretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with
   Congressman Justin Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861,
   raising rates another 10 points in order to generate more
   revenues.^[93] These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to
   meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists
   such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The
   Morrill Tariff of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of
   1862 served not only to raise revenue, but also to encourage the
   establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing
   British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers
   from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of
   thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage
   factory and craftsman jobs.^[94]

Land grants[edit]

   Homesteaders in central Nebraska in 1886

   The U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the
   Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846).
   The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the
   economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land
   grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western
   plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided
   farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the
   land grants speeded up the expansion of commercial agriculture. The
   North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system
   of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial
   expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were
   allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the
   nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban
   buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money
   over to the Treasury for war needs.

Civil War[edit]

   The Union grew rich fighting the war, as the Confederate economy was
   destroyed.^[95] The Republicans in control in Washington had a Whig
   vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories,
   productive farms, national banks, and high-speed rail links. The South
   had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead
   laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit; with the
   South gone, and Northern Democrats very weak in Congress, the
   Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new
   taxes to pay for part of the war, and issued large amounts of bonds to
   pay for the most of the rest. (The remainder can be charged to
   inflation.) They wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization
   that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently
   transforming the economy. The key policy-maker in Congress was Thaddeus
   Stevens, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He took charge of
   major legislation that funded the war effort and revolutionized the
   nation's economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise
   taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks,
   greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.^[96]

   Historians have debated whether or not the Civil War sped up the rate
   of economic growth in the face of destruction throughout the South and
   the diversion of resources to military supplies and away from civilian
   goods. In any case the war taught new organizational methods,
   prioritized engineering skills, and shifted the national attention from
   politics to business.^[97]

Late 19th century[edit]

Commerce, industry and agriculture[edit]

   See also: Gilded Age

   The greatly expanded railroad network with using newly developed steel
   rails dramatically lowered transportation cost to areas without access
   to navigable waterways. Low freight rates allowed large manufacturing
   facilities with great economies of scale. Machinery became a large
   industry and many types of machines were developed. Businesses were
   able to operate over wide areas and chain stores arose. Mail order
   companies started operating.

   An explosion of new discoveries and inventions took place, a process
   called the "Second Industrial Revolution". The electric light,
   telephone, steam turbine, internal combustion engine, automobile,
   phonograph, typewriter and tabulating machine were some of the many
   inventions of the period. New processes for making steel and chemicals
   such as dyes and explosives were invented. The pneumatic tire, improved
   ball bearings, machine tools and newly developed metal stamping
   techniques enabled the large scale production of bicycles in the 1890s.

   One of the most significant developments was the widespread
   introduction of electric street railways (trams, trolleys or
   streetcars) in the 1890s.

   By 1890, the USA leaped ahead of Britain for first place in
   manufacturing output.^[98]

Railroads[edit]

   Railroads saw their greatest growth in new track added in the last
   three decades of the 19th century. (See Table 2) Railroads also enjoyed
   high productivity growth during this time, mainly because of the
   introduction of new processes that made steel inexpensive. Steel rails
   lasted roughly ten times longer than iron rails. Steel rails, becoming
   heavier as steel prices fell, enabled heavier, more powerful
   locomotives that could pull longer trains. Rail cars made of steel
   could be made longer cars and had a load carrying to car weight ratio
   of 2:1 compared to cars made of iron at 1:1.^[99]

   In 1890 David Ames Wells estimated wagon transport at 16 cents per
   ton-mile compared to railroads at less than one cent per
   ton-mile.^[100]

   Railroads competed fiercely for passengers and freight by expanding
   their routes, too often into increasingly marginal ones. The high
   capital required for expansion plus the low rates, driven by
   competition and by what the market would bear, resulted in a large
   percentage of railroad track in bankruptcy.

   A practical refrigerated (ice cooled) railcar was introduced in 1881.
   This made it possible to ship cattle and hog carcasses, which weighed
   only 40% as much as live animals. Gustavus Franklin Swift developed an
   integrated network of cattle procurement, slaughtering, meat-packing
   and shipping meat to market. Up to that time cattle were driven great
   distances to railroad shipping points, causing the cattle to loose
   considerable weight. Swift developed a large business, which grew in
   size with the entry of several competitors.

Steel[edit]

   The Bessemer process was the first large scale process for producing
   steel, which it was able to do at reasonable cost. Due to difficulty in
   controlling the quality, Bessemer steel was most suited to making
   rails.

   The Siemens-Martin process using an open hearth furnace produced a
   suitable grade structural steel. Open hearth steel displaced wrought
   iron as a structural material in the 1880s.

Electric lights and electric street railways[edit]

   Early electrification was too limited to have a big impact on the late
   19th century economy. Electricity was also very expensive because of
   the low conversion efficiency of fuel to power, the small scale of
   power plants and the fact that most utilities offered only night time
   service. Day time service became common during the early 20th century
   after the introduction of the AC motor, which tended to be used more
   during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of
   power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or
   electric street railway (tram or streetcar).^[101]

   Electric street railways were introduced in the U.S. in 1888 when Frank
   Frank J. Sprague designed and built the first practical system in the
   in, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia.
   Electric street railways rapidly spread to cities around the country in
   the following years.

   The early electric street railways typically generated their own power
   and also operated as electric utilities, which served to even out daily
   load because the main use of power for lighting was after the peak
   usage by railways.

   Until the early 1880s electricity had been used in telegraphy and
   electroplating. Efficient dynamo's were introduced in the 1870s and
   began being used to power electric carbon arc lamps after 1879. In 1880
   Thomas Edison patented his invention of a long lasting incandescent
   light bulb and a system for distributing electrical power. In 1882 he
   opened the Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, which was the first
   central power station in the U.S.

   Using DC placed severe restrictions on the distance power could be
   transmitted due to power losses. With DC there was no way to transform
   power to high voltages. Power can be safely generated to about 2000
   volts, but this is a dangerous voltage for household use. With
   alternating current voltage can be changed up or down using a
   transformer. AC power began being widely introduced in the 1890s.

Communications[edit]

   Following the failure of the first short lived Transatlantic telegraph
   cable of 1858, a second, more durable cable was completed in 1865,
   connecting Nova Scotia to England. By 1990 there was an international
   telegraph network.^[100] After invention of the telephone in 1776
   additional development work was required to make it commercially
   viable. The first telephones were for local calls.^[74] Long distance
   calling came into being in the 1890s, but the technology to make
   transcontinental calls took until 1915 to be operational.^[102]

Agriculture[edit]

   South American guano and sodium nitrate began being imported in large
   quantities.

   Sales of various types of horse pulled harvesting machines increased
   dramatically between the Civil war and the end of the century.^[46]
   Harvesting machine improvements included automatic rakers, which
   eliminated the manual raker, allowing operation by a single man, and
   combination harvester and binders.^[83]

   To modernize traditional agriculture reformers founded the Grange
   movement, in 1867. Federal land grants helped each state create an
   agricultural college and a network of extension agents who demonstrated
   modern techniques to farmers. Wheat and cotton farmers in the 1890s
   supported the Populist movement, but failed in their demands for free
   silver and inflation. Instead the 1896 election committed the nation to
   the gold standard and a program of sustained industrialization.

Minerals and mining[edit]

   Parallel to these achievements was the development of the nation's
   industrial infrastructure. Coal was found in abundance in the
   Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south to Kentucky. Oil was
   discovered in western Pennsylvania; it was mainly used for lubricants
   and for kerosene for lamps. Large iron ore mines opened in the Lake
   Superior region of the upper Midwest. Steel mills thrived in places
   where these coal and iron ore could be brought together to produce
   steel. Large copper and silver mines opened, followed by lead mines and
   cement factories.^[103]

Finance, money and banking[edit]

   During the period, a series of recessions happened. Panic of 1873 had
   New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days, of the country's 364
   railroads, 89 went bankrupt, a total of 18,000 businesses failed
   between 1873 and 1875, unemployment reached 14% by 1876, during a time
   which became known as the Long Depression. The end of the Gilded Age
   coincided with the Panic of 1893, a deep depression that lasted until
   1897 and marked a major political realignment in the election of 1896.

Labor unions[edit]

   Main article: Labor unions in the United States
   Workers in New York in 1871 demand the eight-hour day

   The American labor movement began with the first significant labor
   union, the Knights of Labor in 1869. The Knights collapsed in the 1880s
   and were displaced by strong international unions that banded together
   as the American Federation of Labor under Samuel Gompers. Rejecting
   socialism, the AFL unions negotiated with owners for higher wages and
   better working conditions. Union growth was slow until 1900, then grew
   to a peak during World War I.^[104]

Early 20th century[edit]

Industry, commerce and agriculture[edit]

   Two of the most transformative technologies of the century were widely
   introduced during the early part of the century: electrification,
   powered by high pressure boilers and steam turbines and automobiles and
   trucks powered by the internal combustion engine.

Electrification[edit]

   Main article: Electrification

   Electrification had a major impact on the early 20th century economy.
   The revolutionary design of electric powered factories caused the
   period of the highest productivity growth in manufacturing. There was
   large growth in the electric utility industry and the productivity
   growth of electric utilities was high as well.

   Electrification in the U.S. started in industry c. 1900, and by 1930
   about 80% of power used in industry was electric. Electric utilities
   with central generating stations using steam turbines greatly lowered
   the cost of power, with businesses and houses in cities becoming
   electrified.

Electric street railways[edit]

   Electric street railways developed into a major mode of transportation,
   and electric inter-urban service connected many cities in the Northeast
   and Midwest. Electric street railways also carried freight, which was
   important before trucks became widely introduced.

Electrochemicals[edit]

   Electrochemicals are chemicals and metals produced by an electrolytic
   process. Important examples include aluminum made by the Hall–Héroult
   process and chlorine and caustic (sodium and potassium compounds).
   Chlorine and caustic had been produced by chemical processes but
   producing aluminum this way was prohibitively expensive. A large plant
   using Hall–Héroult process was opened in Pittsburgh, USA in 1888 and
   others opened around the world. Falling electricity prices in the early
   20th century greatly lowered the cost of making electrochemicals. There
   was high demand for aluminum for aircraft during World War I and
   afterward for commercial aviation.

   Some other electrochemicals are chromium, manganese and tungsten.

Railroads[edit]

   Main article: Rail transportation in the United States

   At the beginning of the 19th century the railroad network had over
   expanded with many miles of unprofitable routes. In 1906 Congress gave
   the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to regulate freight rates
   and the industry was unable to increase revenue enough to cover rising
   costs. By 1916, the peak year of track mileage, one-sixth of the
   nations railroad trackage was in bankruptcy.

   The railroads proved inadequate to the increased freight volume created
   by World War I. There were major traffic jams in the system and
   critical supplies were experiencing delays. In December 1917 he
   railroads were taken over by the government and put under control of
   the United States Railroad Administration (USRA). The USRA ordered
   1,930 new standardized and over 100,000 railcars. The USRA's control
   over the railroads ended in March 1920.

Automobiles and trucks[edit]

   By the dawn of the 20th century, automobiles had begun to replace
   horse-drawn carriages.^[105] Numerous companies were building cars, but
   car manufacturing was challenging. Consequently, prices were high and
   production was low. Mass production techniques of the late 1910s
   brought down down the cost of automobiles and sales grew dramatically.
   By 1919 automobile registrations were 6.6 million and truck
   registrations were 898,000.^[106]

Highway system[edit]

   In 1900 there were only 200 miles of paved roads outside of cities in
   the U.S.^[107] By the late 1920s automobiles were becoming common, but
   there were few highways connecting cities. The Federal road building
   program ended in 1818, leaving states to build roads until the Federal
   Road act of 1916. A national highway system was agreed on in 1926, at
   which time there were 23.1 million cars and 3.5 million trucks.In 1926,
   when an interstate program began, there were 23.1 million cars and 3.5
   million trucks. The system was nearly complete when the U. S. entered
   World War II in December, 1941.^[108]

Manufacturing[edit]

   Main article: Mass production § Factory electrification

   In 1913 Henry Ford introduced the assembly line, a step in the process
   that became known as mass-production. Frederick W. Taylor pioneered the
   field of scientific management in the late 19th century, carefully
   plotting the functions of various workers and then devising new, more
   efficient ways for them to do their jobs. After 1910 mass production
   was sped by the electrification of factories, which replaced steam and
   water power.^[109]

   In 1913, Henry Ford, adopted the moving assembly line, with each worker
   doing one simple task in the production of automobiles. Taking his cue
   from developments during the progressive era, Ford offered a very
   generous wage—$5 a day—to his workers, arguing that a mass production
   enterprise could not survive if average workers could not buy the
   goods. However, the wage increase did not extend to women, and Ford
   expanded the company's Sociological Department to monitor his workers
   and ensure that they did not spend their newfound bounty on "vice and
   cheap thrills".^[110]

   Gasoline powered tractors began being mass-produced.

Communications[edit]

Telephone[edit]

   The telephone network greatly expanded. Automatic telephone switching,
   which was introduced in 1892, eliminated the need for telephone
   operators to manually connect calls on a switchboard. By 1929, 31.9% of
   the Bell system was automatic.^[111]

Radio[edit]

   Main article: History of radio

   Radio communications using Morse code were introduced in the first
   decade of the 20th century. Their main use was for communicating with
   ships. Ship radio became more widely used after the sinking of the RMS
   Titanic in 1912.

   Radio technology advanced rapidly. The triode vacuum tube made it
   possible to build amplifiers for broadcasting and for receivers. Radio
   circuit design also advanced, allowing better signals with less noise.
   By the early 1920s radios began being mass produced and commercial
   broadcast stations were set up around the country.

Finance, money and banking[edit]

   An major economic downturn in 1906 ended the expansion from the late
   1890s. This was followed by the Panic of 1907. The Panic of 1907 was a
   factor in the establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913.

   The mild inflation of the 1890s, attributed to the rising gold supply
   from mining, continued until World War I, at which time it rose sharply
   with wartime shortages including labor shortages. Following the war
   prices corrected.

   A debt fueled boom developed following the war. Jerome (1934) gives an
   unattributed quote about finance conditions that allowed the great
   industrial expansion of the post WW I period:

     "Probably never before in this country had such a volume of funds
     been available at such low rates for such a long period."^[112]

   There was also a real estate and housing bubble in the 1920s,
   especially in Florida, which burst in 1925. Alvin Hansen stated that
   housing construction during the 1920s decade exceeded population growth
   by 25%.^[113] See also:Florida land boom of the 1920s

   Debt reached unsustainable levels. Speculation in stocks drove prices
   up to unpresented valuation levels. The stock market crashed in late
   October 1929.

Political developments[edit]

   See also: Progressive Era

   In the early years of American history, most political leaders were
   reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private
   sector, except in the area of transportation. In general, they accepted
   the concept of laissez-faire, a doctrine opposing government
   interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This
   attitude started to change during the latter part of the 19th century,
   when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the
   government to intercede on their behalf.^[114]
   Fear of monopolies ("trusts") is shown in this attack on Rockefeller's
   Standard Oil Company

   By the start of the 20th century, a middle class had developed that was
   leery of both the business elite and the somewhat radical political
   movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. Known as
   Progressives, these people favored government regulation of business
   practices to, in their minds, ensure competition and free enterprise.
   Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the Interstate
   Commerce Act), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single
   industry in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act). These laws were not
   rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920,
   when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), Democrat
   President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921), and others sympathetic to the
   views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S.
   regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the
   Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Ida M.
   Tarbell wrote a series of articles against the Standard Oil monopoly.
   The series helped pave the way for the breakup of the monopoly.^[114]

   policies. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified, and the income
   tax was instituted in the United States. Wilson resolved the
   longstanding debates over tariffs and antitrust, and created the
   Federal Reserve, a complex business-government partnership that to this
   day dominates the financial world.

World War I[edit]

   The World War involved a massive mobilization of money, taxes, and
   banking resources to pay for the American war effort and, through
   government-to-government loans, most of the Allied war effort as
   well.^[115]

Roaring twenties: 1920–1929[edit]

   Main article: Roaring Twenties
   People filing tax forms in 1920

   Under Republican President Warren G. Harding, who called for normalcy
   and an end to high wartime taxes, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew
   Mellon raised the tariff, cut other taxes, and used the large surplus
   to reduce the federal debt by about a third from 1920 to 1930.
   Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover worked to introduce efficiency, by
   regulating business practices. This period of prosperity, along with
   the culture of the time, was known as the Roaring Twenties. The rapid
   growth of the automobile industry stimulated industries such as oil,
   glass, and road-building. Tourism soared and consumers with cars had a
   much wider radius for their shopping. Small cities prospered, and large
   cities had their best decade ever, with a boom in construction of
   offices, factories and homes. The new electric power industry
   transformed both business and everyday life. Telephones and electricity
   spread to the countryside, but farmers never recovered from the wartime
   bubble in land prices. Millions migrated to nearby cities. However, in
   October 1929, the Stock market crashed and banks began to fail in the
   Wall Street Crash of 1929.^[116]

From the 1929 through World War II[edit]

Pre-war Industry, commerce and agriculture[edit]

   Despite the Great Depression and World War II, the middle decades of
   the 20th century were among the highest for productivity
   growth.^[117]^[118]

Manufacturing[edit]

   Productivity growth in manufacturing slowed from the electrification
   ear of the early century, but remained moderate. Automation of
   factories became widespread during the middle decades as industry
   invested in newly developed instruments and controls that allowed fewer
   workers to operate vast factories, refineries and chemical plants with
   fewer workers. See: Process control

   deepened an already serious crisis. By 1932, the unemployment rate was
   25%. Conditions were worse in heavy industry, lumbering, export
   agriculture (cotton, wheat, tobacco), and mining. Conditions were not
   quite as bad in white collar sectors and in light manufacturing.^[119]

   Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected President in 1932 without a
   specific program. He relied on a highly eclectic group of advisors who
   patched together many programs, known as the New Deal.

Spending[edit]

   Government spending increased from 8.0% of GNP under Hoover in 1932 to
   10.2% of GNP in 1936. While Roosevelt balanced the "regular" budget the
   emergency budget was funded by debt, which increased from 33.6% of GNP
   in 1932 to 40.9% in 1936.^[121] Deficit spending had been recommended
   by some economists, most notably John Maynard Keynes in Britain.
   Roosevelt met Keynes but did not pay attention to his recommendations.
   After a meeting with Keynes, who kept drawing diagrams, Roosevelt
   remarked that "He must be a mathematician rather than a political
   economist".^[122]

Banking crisis[edit]

   In 1929–33 the economy was destabilized by bank failures. The initial
   reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by bank
   runs. Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers lost
   confidence in their deposits (which were not insured) and rushed to
   withdraw their deposits. Runs destabilized many banks to the point
   where they faced bankruptcy. Between 1929 and 1933 40% of all banks
   (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) went bankrupt.^[123] Much of the Great
   Depression's economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.^[124]

   Hoover had already considered a bank holiday to prevent further bank
   runs, but rejected the idea because he was afraid to trip a panic.
   Roosevelt acted as soon as he took office; he closed all the banks in
   the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new
   legislation.^[125] On March 9, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency
   Banking Act, drafted in large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act
   was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system
   of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans
   available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve
   System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in
   hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus
   stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local
   banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their
   deposits totalled $3.6 billion; depositors lost a total of $540
   million, and eventually received on average 85 cents on the dollar of
   their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing
   back.^[126] The Glass–Steagall Act limited commercial bank securities
   activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities
   firms to regulate speculations. It also established the Federal Deposit
   Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits for up to
   $250,000, ended the risk of runs on banks.^[127]

Relief[edit]

   The extent to which the spending for relief and public works provided a
   sufficient stimulus to revive the U.S. economy, or whether it harmed
   the economy, is also debated. If one defines economic health entirely
   by the gross domestic product, the U.S. had gotten back on track by
   1934, and made a full recovery by 1936, but as Roosevelt said, one
   third of the nation was ill fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed. See Chart
   3. GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than 1932, and 58% higher in 1940 on the
   eve of war. The economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of
   peacetime, and then grew another 56% from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of
   wartime. The unemployment rate fell from 25.2% in 1932 to 13.9% in 1940
   when the draft started. During the war the economy operated under so
   many different conditions that comparison is impossible with peacetime,
   such as massive spending, price controls, bond campaigns, controls over
   raw materials, prohibitions on new housing and new automobiles,
   rationing, guaranteed cost-plus profits, subsidized wages, and the
   draft of 12 million soldiers.

   of constant dollars^[128]

   In 1995 economist Robert Whaples from Wake Forest University stated
   that measuring the effect of the New Deal remains a thorny issue for
   economists because it's so difficult to measure the effects it had on
   the country. One small survey by Whaples showed that 49% of those
   economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the
   depression, while 51% disagreed.^[129] The same survey also showed that
   only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists
   felt the same way. However, economist Eric Rauchway of the University
   of California stated "very few people disapprove of most of the New
   Deal reforms", which include Social Security, the Securities and
   Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Fannie
   Mae. Regardless, unemployment peaked in 1932 at 25% and was reduced to
   13.9% by 1940.^[130]

   As Broadus Mitchell summarized, "Most indexes worsened until the summer
   of 1932, which may be called the low point of the depression
   economically and psychologically".^[131] Economic indicators show the
   American economy declined until February 1933. After Roosevelt took
   office, there began a steady, sharp upward recovery that persisted
   until the brief Recession of 1937–1938 (see graph) after which they
   continued their upward climb. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of
   Industrial Production bottomed at 52.8 on July 1, 1932 and was
   practically unchanged at 54.3 on March 1, 1933; however by July 1,
   1933, it had climbed to 85.5 (with 1935–39 = 100, and for comparison
   2005 = 1,342).^[132]

Wartime output and controls: 1940–1945[edit]

   Women making aluminum shells for the war in 1942

   Unemployment dropped to 2%, relief programs largely ended, and the
   industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people
   moved to new jobs in war centers, and 16 million men and 300,000 women
   were drafted or volunteered for military service.

   All economic sectors grew during the war. Farm output went from an
   index (by volume) of 106 in 1939 to 128 in 1943. Coal output went from
   446 million tons in 1939 to 651 in 1943; oil from 1.3 billion barrels
   to 1.5 billion. Manufacturing output doubled, from a volume index of
   109 in 1939 to 239 in 1943. Railroads strained to move it all to
   market, going from an output of 13.6 billion loaded car miles in 1939
   to 23.3 in 1943.^[133]

   The War Production Board coordinated the nation's productive
   capabilities so that military priorities would be met. Converted
   consumer-products plants filled many military orders. Automakers built
   tanks and aircraft, for example, making the United States the "arsenal
   of democracy". In an effort to prevent rising national income and
   scarce consumer products from causing inflation, the newly created
   Office of Price Administration rationed and set prices for consumer
   items ranging from sugar to meat, clothing and gasoline, and otherwise
   tried to restrain price increases. It also set rent in war
   centers.^[134]

   Six million women took jobs in manufacturing and production; most were
   newly created temporary jobs in munitions. Some were replacing men away
   in the military. These working women were symbolized by the fictional
   character of Rosie the Riveter. After the war many women returned to
   household work as men returned from military service. The nation turned
   to the suburbs, as a pent-up demand for new housing was finally
   unleashed.^[135]

Postwar prosperity: 1945–1973[edit]

   Further information: Post–World War II economic expansion

   The period from the end of World War II to the early 1970s was a golden
   era of American capitalism. $200 billion in war bonds matured, and the
   G.I. Bill financed a well-educated work force. The middle class
   swelled, as did GDP and productivity. The U.S. underwent a kind of
   golden age of economic growth. This growth was distributed fairly
   evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the
   strength of labor unions in this period—labor union membership peaked
   historically in the U.S. during the 1950s, in the midst of this massive
   economic growth. Much of the growth came from the movement of low
   income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities—a
   process largely completed by 1960. Congress created the Council of
   Economic Advisors, to promote high employment, high profits and low
   inflation. The Eisenhower administration (1953–1961) supported an
   activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism
   as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation. Especially important in
   formulating the CEA response to the recession—accelerating public works
   programs, easing credit, and reducing taxes—were Arthur F. Burns and
   Neil H. Jacoby. ""I am now a Keynesian in economics", proclaimed
   Republican President Richard Nixon in 1969.^[136] Although this period
   brought economic expanding to the country as whole, it was not
   recession proof. The recessions of 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, and 1960 saw
   a drastic decline in GDP.

   The "Baby Boom" saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period
   1942–1957; it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during
   depression years, a surge in prosperity, a demand for suburban
   single-family homes (as opposed to inner city apartments) and new
   optimism about the future. The boom crested about 1957, then slowly
   declined.^[137]

Agriculture[edit]

   Ammonia from plants built during both world wars to make explosives
   became available for fertilizers.^[138] The early 1950s was he peak
   period for tractor sales in the U.S. as horses and mules were phased
   out. The horsepower of farm machinery underwent a large
   expansion.^[139]

   Research on plant breeding to produce varieties of grain crops that
   could produce high yields with heavy fertilizer input. This resulted in
   the Green revolution, beginning in the 1940s. By the century's end
   yields of corn (maize) rose by a factor of over four. Wheat and soybean
   yields also rose significantly.

Aircraft and air transportation industries[edit]

   Air transport was a major beneficiary of the war. The United States was
   the leading producer of combat aircraft during World War II and had a
   large surplus of machine tools and manufacturing facilities for
   airplanes at the end of the war.^[140] There were also experienced
   airplane manufacturing and maintenance personnel. Additionally, radar
   had been developed during the war.

   The aircraft industry had the highest productivity growth of any major
   industry, growing by 8.9% per year from 1829-1966.^[141]

Interstate highway system[edit]

   Construction of the Interstate Highway System began in 1956.

Mainframe computers[edit]

   Mainframe business computer systems started being widely introduced in
   the 1960s. These systems handled a variety of accounting, billing and
   payroll functions.

   One highly significant application was the Sabre airline reservations
   system, which first went into operation in 1960. With Sabre
   reservations could be placed remotely using teleprinters and all
   functions were done automatically, including ticket printing. This
   eliminated manually handling file cards.

Liberal programs[edit]

   Federal taxes on incomes, profits and payrolls had risen to high levels
   during World War II and had been cut back only slowly; the highest
   rates for individuals reached the 90% level. Congress cut tax rates in
   1964. President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–69) dreamed of creating a
   "Great Society", and began many new social programs to that end, such
   as Medicaid and Medicare. The government financed some of private
   industry's research and development throughout these decades, most
   notably ARPANET (which would become the Internet).^[142]

Late 20th century[edit]

Post industrial (service) economy[edit]

   Manufacturing employment and nominal value added shares of the economy
   have been in a steady decline since World War II. In the late 1960s
   manufacturing's share of of both employment and nominal value added was
   about 26%, falling to about 11% and 12% respectively by the end of the
   century.^[143]

   Per-capita steel consumption in the U.S. peaked in 1977, then fell by
   half before staging a modest recovery to levels well below the
   peak.^[144]

Service sector expansion[edit]

   The decline in the relative size of manufacturing coincided with a rise
   in the size of the service sector.^[117]

Productivity slowdown[edit]

   Technological innovations of the final third of the 20th century were
   significant, but were not as powerful as those of the first two-thirds
   of the century. Manufacturing productivity growth continued at a
   somewhat slower than in earlier decades, but overall productivity was
   dragged down by the government and service sectors.^[117]

Inflation woes: 1970s[edit]

   The postwar boom ended with a number of events in the early 1970s:
     * the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971
     * the growing influx of imported manufacturing goods, such as
       automobiles and electronics
     * the 1973 oil crisis,
     * productivity growth fell to a low level after 1973 and remained low
       until the 1990s,
     * the 1973–1974 stock market crash,
     * and the ensuing displacement of Keynesian economics by monetarist
       economics, especially by the free-market Chicago School of
       Economics, led by economist Milton Friedman. At the same time, the
       consensus among experts moved against New-Deal-style regulation, in
       favor of deregulation.

   In the late 1960s it was apparent to some that this juggernaut of
   economic growth was slowing down, and it began to become visibly
   apparent in the early 1970s. The United States grew increasingly
   dependent on oil importation from OPEC after peaking production in
   1970, resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and 1979. Stagflation
   gripped the nation, and the government experimented with wage and price
   controls under President Nixon. The Bretton Woods Agreement collapsed
   in 1971–1972, and President Nixon closed the gold window at the Federal
   Reserve, taking the United States entirely off the gold standard.
   President Gerald Ford introduced the slogan, "Whip Inflation Now"
   (WIN). In 1974, productivity shrunk by 1.5%, though this soon
   recovered. In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the Presidency. Carter would later
   take much of the blame for the even more turbulent economic times to
   come, though some^[who?] say circumstances were outside his control.
   Inflation continued to climb skyward. Productivity growth was small,
   when not negative. Interest rates remained high, with the prime
   reaching 20% in January 1981; Art Buchwald quipped that 1980 would go
   down in history as the year when it was cheaper to borrow money from
   the Mafia than the local bank.^[142]

   Unemployment dropped mostly steadily from 1975 to 1979, although it
   then began to rise sharply.

   This period also saw the increased rise of the environmental and
   consumer movements, and the government established new regulations and
   regulatory agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health
   Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission, and others.

Deregulation and Reaganomics: 1976–1992[edit]

   This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by
   verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements
   consisting only of original research should be removed. (December 2013)

   Deregulation gained momentum in the mid-1970s, spurred by slow
   productivity growth and increasing operation and capital costs in
   several key sectors. It was not until 1978 that the first meaningful
   deregulation legislation, the Airline Deregulation Act, was cleared by
   Congress. Transportation deregulation accelerated in 1980, with the
   deregulation of railroads and trucking. Deregulation of interstate
   buses followed in 1982. In addition to transportation deregulation,
   savings and loan associations and banks were partially deregulated with
   the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in
   1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982.

   On a broader front, the economy initially recovered at a brisk pace
   from the 1973–75 recession. Incoming president Jimmy Carter instituted
   a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy.
   However, inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978, and rose
   by double digits following the 1979 energy crisis. In order to combat
   inflation, Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the Federal Reserve, who
   raised interest rates and caused a sharp recession in the first six
   months of 1980.^[145] In March 1980, Carter introduced his own policies
   for reducing inflation, and the Federal Reserve brought down interest
   rates to cooperate with the initiatives.^[146]

   During the 1980 recession, manufacturing shed 1.1 million jobs, while
   service industries remained intact. Employment in automotive
   manufacturing in particular suffered, experiencing a 33% reduction by
   the end of the recession.^[147] Collectively these factors contributed
   to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. The Federal Reserve once
   again began to raise interest rates in 1981, which plunged the economy
   back into recession. Unemployment rose to a peak of 10.8% in December
   1982, a post-war high.^[148]

   In 1981, Ronald Reagan introduced Reaganomics. That is, fiscally
   expansive economic policies, cutting marginal federal income tax rates
   by 25%. Inflation dropped dramatically from 13.5% annually in 1980 to
   just 3% annually in 1983 due to a short recession and the Federal
   Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's tighter control of the money supply and
   interest rates. Real GDP began to grow after contracting in 1980 and
   1982. The unemployment rate continued to rise to a peak of 10.8% by
   late 1982, but dropped well under 6% unemployment at the end of
   Reagan's presidency in January 1989. 20 million jobs were created under
   his presidency – which were made up of 82 percent high-paying and
   long-term jobs. From 1982 to 1987 the Dow Jones Industrial Average
   gained over 1900 points from 776 in 1982 to 2722 in 1987 – about a 350%
   increase. An economic boom took place from 1983 until a recession began
   in 1990. Between 1983 and 1989 the amount of people below the poverty
   line decreased by 3.8 million.^[149] The boom saw the increasing
   popularity of electronic appliances like computers, cell phones, music
   players and video games. Credit cards were a symbol of the boom. The
   Reagan tax cuts seemed to work and Americans were able to shrug off the
   crash of 1987 by the beginning of 1988. The growth ended by 1990 after
   seven years of stock market growth and prosperity for the upper and
   middle class. The federal debt spawned by his policies tripled (from
   $930 billion in 1981 to $2.6 trillion in 1988), reaching record
   levels.^[150] Though debt almost always increased under every president
   in the latter half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of
   GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan. In addition to
   the fiscal deficits, the U.S. started to have large trade deficits.
   Also it was during his second term that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was
   passed. Vice President George H. W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan
   in 1988. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes
   seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s,
   Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with
   Congressional Democrats. He ended his presidency on a moderate note,
   signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act,
   and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1992, Bush
   and third-party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill
   Clinton.^[151]

   The advent of deindustrialization in the late 1960s and early 1970s saw
   income inequality increase dramatically to levels never seen before.
   But at the same time, most orthodox economists, and most policy makers,
   pointed to the fact that consumers could buy so many goods, even with
   the inflation of the 1970s, as evidence that the general shift away
   from manufacturing and into services was creating widespread
   prosperity. In 1968, the U.S. Gini coefficient was 0.386. In 2005, the
   American Gini coefficient had reached 0.469. Critics of economic
   policies favored by Republican and Democratic administrations since the
   1960s, particularly those expanding "free trade" and "open markets"
   (see Neoliberalism) say that these policies, though benefiting trading
   as well as the cost of products in the U.S., could have taken their own
   on the prosperity of the American middle-class. But in this period,
   consumers were buying as never before with so many products and goods
   at such low costs and in high quantities. Critics however argued that
   this consumer behavior was giving a false reading of the health of the
   economy, because it was being paid for by taking on rapidly increasing
   levels of indebtedness, thus covering up the stagnating wages and
   earnings of most of the workforce.

The rise of globalization: 1990s – late 2000s[edit]

   Main article: New economy
   This graph shows three major stock indices since 1975. Notice the
   meteoric rise of the stock market in the 1990s, followed by the
   collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000 on the tech-heavy NASDAQ.

   During the 1990s, government debt increased by 75%, GDP rose by 69%,
   and the stock market as measured by the S&P 500 grew more than
   threefold.

   From 1994 to 2000 real output increased, inflation was manageable and
   unemployment dropped to below 5%, resulting in a soaring stock market
   known as the dot-com boom. The second half of the 1990s was
   characterized by well-publicized initial public offerings of high-tech
   and "dot-com" companies. By 2000, however, it was evident a bubble in
   stock valuations had occurred, such that beginning in March 2000, the
   market would give back some 50% to 75% of the growth of the 1990s. The
   economy worsened in 2001 with output increasing only 0.3% and
   unemployment and business failures rising substantially, and triggering
   a recession that is often blamed on the September 11 attacks.^[citation
   needed]

   An additional factor in the fall of the US markets and in investor
   confidence included numerous corporate scandals.

   From 2001-07, the red-hot housing market across the United States
   fueled a false sense of security regarding the strength of the U.S.
   economy.

   President Barack Obama signs the ARRA into law on February 17, 2009 in
   Denver, Colorado. Vice President Joe Biden stands behind him.

   In 2008 a perfect storm of economic disasters hit the country and
   indeed the entire world. The most serious began with the collapse of
   housing bubbles in California and Florida, and the collapse of housing
   prices and the construction industries. Millions of mortgages
   (averaging about $200,000 each) had been bundled into securities called
   collateralized debt obligations that were resold worldwide. Many banks
   and hedge funds had borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars to buy
   these securities, which were now "toxic" because their value was
   unknown and no one wanted to buy them.^[152]

   A series of the largest banks in the U.S. and Europe collapsed; some
   went bankrupt, such as Lehman Brothers with $690 billion in assets;
   others such as the leading insurance company AIG, the leading bank
   Citigroup, and the two largest mortgage companies were bailed out by
   the government. Congress voted $700 billion in bailout money, and the
   Treasury and Federal Reserve committed trillions of dollars to shoring
   up the financial system, but the measures did not reverse the declines.
   Banks drastically tightened their lending policies, despite infusions
   of federal money. The government for the first time took major
   ownership positions in the largest banks. The stock market plunged 40%,
   wiping out tens of trillions of dollars in wealth; housing prices fell
   20% nationwide wiping out trillions more. By late 2008 distress was
   spreading beyond the financial and housing sectors, especially as the
   "Big Three" of the automobile industry (General Motors, Ford and
   Chrysler) were on the verge of bankruptcy, and the retail sector showed
   major weaknesses. Critics of the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief
   Program (TARP) expressed anger that much of the TARP money that has
   been distributed to banks is seemingly unaccounted for, with banks
   being secretive on the issue.^[153]
   Percent of US civilian working age population employed, 1995–2012

   President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment
   Act of 2009 in February 2009; the bill provides $787 billion in
   stimulus through a combination of spending and tax cuts. The plan is
   largely based on the Keynesian theory that government spending should
   offset the fall in private spending during an economic downturn;
   otherwise the fall in private spending may perpetuate itself and
   productive resources, such as the labor hours of the unemployed, will
   be wasted. Critics claim that government spending cannot offset a fall
   in private spending because government must borrow money from the
   private sector in order to add money to it. However, most economists do
   not think such "crowding out" is an issue when interest rates are near
   zero and the economy is stagnant. Opponents of the stimulus also point
   to problems of possible future inflation and government debt caused by
   such a large expenditure.^[154]^[155]

   In the U.S., jobs paying between $14 and $21 per hour made up about 60%
   those lost during the recession, but such mid-wage jobs have comprised
   only about 27% of jobs gained during the recovery through mid-2012. In
   contrast, lower-paying jobs constituted about 58% of the jobs
   regained.^[156]
