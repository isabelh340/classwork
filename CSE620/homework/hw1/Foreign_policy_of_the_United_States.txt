   The foreign policy of the United States is the way in which it
   interacts with foreign nations and sets standards of interaction for
   its organizations, corporations and individual citizens.

   The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States,
   as mentioned in the Foreign Policy Agenda of the U.S. Department of
   State, are "to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and
   prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the
   international community."^[1] In addition, the United States House
   Committee on Foreign Affairs states as some of its jurisdictional
   goals: "export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear
   technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial
   intercourse with foreign nations and to safeguard American business
   abroad; international commodity agreements; international education;
   and protection of American citizens abroad and expatriation."^[2] U.S.
   foreign policy and foreign aid have been the subject of much debate,
   praise and criticism both domestically and abroad.

Powers of the President and Congress[edit]

   The US Constitution gives much of the foreign policy decision-making to
   the presidency, but the Senate has a role in ratifying treaties, and
   the Supreme Court interprets treaties when cases are presented to it.
   Main articles: Treaty Clause, War Powers Clause, Appointments Clause
   and Foreign Commerce Clause

   Subject to the advice and consent role of the U.S. Senate, the
   President of the United States negotiates treaties with foreign
   nations, but treaties enter into force if ratified by two-thirds of the
   Senate. The President is also Commander in Chief of the United States
   Armed Forces, and as such has broad authority over the armed forces;
   however only Congress has authority to declare war, and the civilian
   and military budget is written by the Congress. The United States
   Secretary of State is the foreign minister of the United States and is
   the primary conductor of state-to-state diplomacy. Both the Secretary
   of State and ambassadors are appointed by the President, with the
   advice and consent of the Senate. Congress also has power to regulate
   commerce with foreign nations.^[3]

Historical overview[edit]

   Main articles: History of U.S. foreign policy and Timeline of United
   States diplomatic history
   The Jay Treaty of 1795 aligned the U.S. more with Britain less with
   France, leading to political polarization at home

   The main trend regarding the history of U.S. foreign policy since the
   American Revolution is the shift from non-interventionism before and
   after World War I, to its growth as a world power and global hegemony
   during and since World War II and the end of the Cold War in the 20th
   century.^[4] Since the 19th century, US foreign policy also has been
   characterized by a shift from the realist school to the idealistic or
   Wilsonian school of international relations.^[5]

   Foreign policy themes were expressed considerably in George
   Washington's farewell address; these included among other things,
   observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating
   peace and harmony with all, excluding both "inveterate antipathies
   against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others",
   "steer[ing] clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the
   foreign world", and advocating trade with all nations. These policies
   became the basis of the Federalist Party in the 1790s. But the rival
   Jeffersonians feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s, declaring
   the War of 1812 on Britain. After the 1778 alliance with France, the
   U.S. did not sign another permanent treaty until the North Atlantic
   Treaty in 1949. Over time, other themes, key goals, attitudes, or
   stances have been variously expressed by Presidential 'doctrines',
   named for them. Initially these were uncommon events, but since WWII,
   these have been made by most presidents.

   In general, the United States followed an isolationist foreign policy
   until attacks against U.S. shipping by Barbary corsairs spurred the
   country into developing a naval force projection capability, resulting
   in the First Barbary War in 1801.^[6]

   Despite occasional entanglements with European Powers such as the War
   of 1812 and the 1898 Spanish-American War, U.S. foreign policy was
   marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade and scope during the
   19th century, and it maintained its policy of avoiding wars with and
   between European powers. Concerning its domestic borders, the 1803
   Louisiana Purchase doubled the nation's geographical area; Spain ceded
   the territory of Florida in 1819; annexation brought Texas in 1845; a
   war with Mexico in 1848 added California, Arizona and New Mexico. The
   U.S. bought Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867, and it annexed the
   Republic of Hawaii in 1898. Victory over Spain in 1898 brought the
   Philippines, and Puerto Rico, as well as oversight of Cuba. The short
   experiment in imperialism ended by 1908, as the U.S. turned its
   attention to the Panama Canal and the stabilization of regions to its
   south, including Mexico.

20th century[edit]

World War I[edit]

   The 20th century was marked by two world wars in which the United
   States, along with allied powers, defeated its enemies and increased
   its international reputation. President Wilson's Fourteen Points,
   developed from his idealistic Wilsonianism program of spreading
   democracy and fighting militarism so as to end wars. It became the
   basis of the German Armistice (really a surrender) and the 1919 Paris
   Peace Conference. The resulting Treaty of Versailles, due to European
   allies' punitive and territorial designs, showed insufficient
   conformity with these points and the U.S. signed separate treaties with
   each of its adversaries; due to Senate objections also, the U.S. never
   joined the League of Nations, which was established as a result of
   Wilson's initiative. In the 1920s, the United States followed an
   independent course, and succeeded in a program of naval disarmament,
   and refunding the German economy. New York became the financial capital
   of the world, but the downside was that the Wall Street Crash of 1929
   hurled the entire world into the Great Depression. American trade
   policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans, and reciprocal
   trade agreements under the Democrats, but in any case exports were at
   very low levels in the 1930s.

World War II[edit]

   Main article: Diplomatic history of World War II § United States
   Allies of World War II at the Yalta Conference: Winston Churchill,
   Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin.

   The United States adopted a non-interventionist foreign policy from
   1932 to 1938, but then President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved toward
   strong support of the Allies in their wars against Germany and Japan.
   As a result of intense internal debate, the national policy was one of
   becoming the Arsenal of Democracy, that is financing and equipping the
   Allied armies without sending American combat soldiers. Roosevelt
   mentioned four fundamental freedoms, which ought to be enjoyed by
   people "everywhere in the world"; these included the freedom of speech
   and religion, as well as freedom from want and fear. Roosevelt helped
   establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the
   Atlantic Conference; specific points were included to correct earlier
   failures, which became a step toward the United Nations. American
   policy was to threaten Japan, to force it out of China, and to prevent
   its attacking the Soviet Union. However, Japan reacted by an attack on
   Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the United States was at war with
   Japan, Germany, and Italy. Instead of the loans given to allies in
   World War I, the United States provided Lend-Lease grants of
   $50,000,000,000. Working closely with Winston Churchill of Britain, and
   Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt sent his forces into the
   Pacific against Japan, then into North Africa against Italy and
   Germany, and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944
   against the Germans. The American economy roared forward, doubling
   industrial production, and building vast quantities of airplanes,
   ships, tanks, munitions, and, finally, the atomic bomb. Much of the
   American war effort went to strategic bombers, which flattened the
   cities of Japan and Germany.

Cold War[edit]

   Main article: History of the Cold War
   Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong meets with U.S. President
   Richard Nixon, 1972

   After the war, the U.S. rose to become the dominant non-colonial
   economic power with broad influence in much of the world, with the key
   policies of the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Almost
   immediately however, the world witnessed division into broad two camps
   during the Cold War; one side was led by the U.S., and the other by the
   Soviet Union, but this situation also led to the establishment of the
   Non-Aligned Movement. This period lasted until almost the end of the
   20th century, and is thought to be both an ideological and power
   struggle between the two superpowers. A policy of containment was
   adopted to limit Soviet expansion, and a series of proxy wars were
   fought with mixed results. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into
   separate nations, and the Cold War formally ended as the United States
   gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and
   other former Soviet states. With these changes to forty-five years of
   established diplomacy and military confrontation, new challenges
   confronted U.S. policymakers. American foreign policy is characterized
   by the protection of its national interests.

21st century[edit]

   In the 21st century, U.S. influence remains strong but, in relative
   terms, is declining in terms of economic output compared to rising
   nations such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, and the newly
   consolidated European Union. Substantial problems remain, such as
   climate change, nuclear proliferation, and the specter of nuclear
   terrorism. Foreign policy analysts Hachigian and Sutphen in their book
   The Next American Century suggest all six powers have similar vested
   interests in stability and terrorism prevention and trade; if they can
   find common ground, then the next decades may be marked by peaceful
   growth and prosperity.^[7]

Law[edit]

   Main articles: Treaty and Treaty Clause

   In the United States, there are three types of treaty-related law:
     * Executive agreements
          + Congressional-executive agreements are made by the president
            and Congress. A majority of both houses makes it binding much
            like regular legislation after it is signed by the president.
            The constitution does not expressly state that these
            agreements are allowed, and constitutional scholars such as
            Laurence Tribe think they are unconstitutional.^[citation
            needed] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld their
            validity.^[citation needed]
          + Sole executive agreements are made by the president alone.
     * Treaties are formal written agreements specified by the Treaty
       Clause of the Constitution. The president makes a treaty with
       foreign powers, but then the proposed treaty must be ratified by a
       two-thirds vote in the Senate. For example, President Wilson
       proposed the Treaty of Versailles after World War I after
       consulting with allied powers, but this treaty was rejected by the
       U.S. Senate; as a result, the U.S. subsequently made separate
       agreements with different nations. While most international law has
       a broader interpretation of the term treaty, the U.S. sense of the
       term is more restricted. In Missouri v. Holland, the Supreme Court
       ruled that the power to make treaties under the U.S. Constitution
       is a power separate from the other enumerated powers of the federal
       government, and hence the federal government can use treaties to
       legislate in areas which would otherwise fall within the exclusive
       authority of the states.

   International law in most nations considers all three of the above
   agreements as treaties. In most nations, treaty laws supersede domestic
   law. So if there is a conflict between a treaty obligation and a
   domestic law, then the treaty usually prevails.

   In contrast to most other nations, the United States considers the
   three types of agreements as distinct. Further, the United States
   incorporates treaty law into the body of U.S. federal law. As a result,
   Congress can modify or repeal treaties afterwards. It can overrule an
   agreed-upon treaty obligation even if this is seen as a violation of
   the treaty under international law. Several U.S. court rulings
   confirmed this understanding, including the 1900 Supreme Court decision
   in Paquete Habana, a late 1950s decision in Reid v. Covert, and a lower
   court ruling in 1986 in Garcia-Mir v. Meese. Further, the Supreme Court
   has declared itself as having the power to rule a treaty as void by
   declaring it "unconstitutional", although as of 2011, it has never
   exercised this power.

   The State Department has taken the position that the Vienna Convention
   on the Law of Treaties represents established law. Generally when the
   U.S. signs a treaty, it is binding. However, because of the Reid v.
   Covert decision, the U.S. adds a reservation to the text of every
   treaty that says, in effect, that the U.S. intends to abide by the
   treaty, but if the treaty is found to be in violation of the
   Constitution, then the U.S. legally can't abide by the treaty since the
   U.S. signature would be ultra vires.

Alliances[edit]

NATO[edit]

   A map of allies of the United States

     Signatories of Partnership for Peace with NATO

   The United States is a founding member of NATO, the world's largest
   military alliance. The 28-nation alliance consists of Canada and much
   of Europe, including the nation with NATO's second largest military,
   the United Kingdom. Under the NATO charter, the United States is
   compelled to defend any NATO state that is attacked by a foreign power.
   NATO is restricted to within the North American and European areas. In
   1989, the United States also granted five nations the major non-NATO
   ally status (MNNA); this number was increased in the late 1990s and
   following the September 11 attacks; it currently includes 15 nations.
   Each such state has a unique relationship with the United States,
   involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances.

United Kingdom[edit]

   Main article: United Kingdom–United States relations
   Further information: Special Relationship and Anglosphere
   Queen Elizabeth II welcomes President Obama and First Lady Michelle
   Obama to Buckingham Palace on April 1, 2009.

   United States foreign policy affirms its alliance with the United
   Kingdom as its most important^[citation needed] bilateral relationship
   in the world, evidenced by aligned political affairs between the White
   House and 10 Downing Street, as well as joint military operations
   carried out between the two nations. While both the United States and
   the United Kingdom maintain close relationships with many other nations
   around the world, the level of cooperation in military planning,
   execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and
   intelligence sharing with each other has been described as
   "unparalleled" among major powers throughout the 20th and early 21st
   century.^[8]

   The United States and Britain share the world's largest foreign direct
   investment partnership. American investment in the United Kingdom
   reached $255.4 billion in 2002, while British direct investment in the
   United States totaled $283.3 billion.^[9]

Canada[edit]

   (left) meet in Ottawa in February 2009
   Main article: Canada–United States relations

   The bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States is of
   notable importance to both countries. About 75–85% of Canadian trade is
   with the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest
   trading partner and chief supplier of oil. While there are disputed
   issues between the two nations, relations are close and the two
   countries share the "world's longest undefended border."^[10] The
   border was demilitarized after the War of 1812 and, apart from minor
   raids^[clarification needed], has remained peaceful. Military
   collaboration began during World War II and continued throughout the
   Cold War on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral relationship
   through NATO. A high volume of trade and migration between the United
   States and Canada since the 1850s has generated closer ties, despite
   continued Canadian fears of being culturally overwhelmed by its
   neighbor, which is nine times larger in terms of population and eleven
   times larger in terms of economy.^[11]^[12] The two economies have
   increasingly merged since the North American Free Trade Agreement
   (NAFTA) of 1994, which also includes Mexico.

Mexico[edit]

   Main article: Mexico–United States relations

   The United States shares a unique and often complex relationship with
   Mexico. A history of armed conflict goes back to the Texas Revolution
   in the 1830s, the Mexican–American War in the 1840s, and an American
   invasion in the 1910s. Important treaties include the Gadsden Purchase,
   and multilaterally with Canada, the North American Free Trade
   Agreement. The central issue in recent years has been illegal
   immigration, followed by illegal gun sales (from the U.S.), drug
   smuggling (to the U.S.) and escalating drug cartel violence just south
   of the U.S.-Mexico border.^[13]^[14]

Australia[edit]

   Main article: Australia–United States relations
   Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd talks with United States
   President Barack Obama in Washington

   The United States' relationship with Australia is a very close one,
   with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stating that "America doesn't
   have a better friend in the world than Australia".^[15] The
   relationship is formalized by the ANZUS treaty and the Australia–United
   States Free Trade Agreement. The two countries have a shared history,
   both have previously been British Colonies and many Americans flocked
   to the Australian goldfields in the 19th century. At a strategic level,
   the relationship really came to prominence in World War II, when the
   two nations worked extremely closely in the Pacific War against Japan,
   with General Douglas MacArthur undertaking his role as Supreme Allied
   Commander based in Australia, effectively having Australian troops and
   resources under his command. During this period, the cultural
   interaction between Australia and the U.S. were elevated to a higher
   level as over 1 million U.S. military personnel moved through Australia
   during the course of the war. The relationship continued to evolve
   throughout the second half of the 20th Century, and today now involves
   strong relationships at the executive and mid levels of government and
   the military, leading Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
   Pacific Affairs, Kurt M. Campbell to declare that "in the last ten
   years, [Australia] has ascended to one of the closest one or two allies
   [of the U.S.] on the planet".^[16]

Middle East[edit]

   Main article: United States foreign policy in the Middle East

   The United States has many important allies in the Greater Middle East
   region. These allies are Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Afghanistan,
   Pakistan, Israel, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Morocco. Israel and
   Egypt are leading recipients of United States foreign aid, receiving
   $2.775 billion^[17] and 1.75 billion^[18] in 2010. Turkey is an ally of
   the United States through its membership in NATO, while all of the
   other countries except Saudi Arabia and Qatar are major non-NATO
   allies.

   The United States toppled the government of Saddam Hussein during the
   2003 invasion of Iraq.^[19] Turkey is host to approximately 90 B61
   nuclear bombs at Incirlik Air Base.^[20] Other allies include Qatar,
   where 3,500 U.S. troops are based,^[21] and Bahrain, where the United
   States Navy maintains NSA Bahrain, home of NAVCENT and the Fifth Fleet.

Japan[edit]

   Main article: Japan–United States relations

   The relationship began in the 1850s as the U.S. was a major factor in
   forcing Japan to resume contacts with the outer world beyond a very
   restricted role. In the late 19th century the Japanese sent many
   delegations to Europe, and some to the U.S., to discover and copy the
   latest technology and thereby modernize Japan very rapidly and allow it
   to build its own empire. There was some friction over control of Hawaii
   and the Philippines, but Japan stood aside as the U.S. annexed those
   lands in 1898. Likewise the U.S. did not object when Japan took control
   of Korea. The two nations cooperated with the European powers in
   suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, but the U.S. was
   increasingly troubled about Japan's denial of the Open Door Policy that
   would ensure that all nations could do business with China on an equal
   basis.^[22]

   President Theodore Roosevelt admired Japan's strength as it defeated a
   major European power, Russia. He brokered an end to the war between
   Russia and Japan in 1905–6. Anti-Japanese sentiment (especially on the
   West Coast) soured relations in the 1907–24 era. In the 1930s the U.S.
   protested vehemently against Japan's seizure of Manchuria (1931), its
   war against China (1937–45), and its seizure of Indochina (Vietnam)
   1940–41. American sympathies were with China and Japan rejected
   increasingly angry American demands that Japan pull out of China. The
   two nations fought an all-out war 1941–45; the U.S. won a total
   victory, with heavy bombing (including two atomic bombs on Hiroshima
   and Nagasaki) that devastated Japan's 50 largest industrial cities. The
   American army under Douglas MacArthur occupied and ruled Japan,
   1945–51, with the successful goal of sponsoring a peaceful, prosperous
   and democratic nation.^[23]

   In 1951, the U.S. and Japan signed Treaty of San Francisco and Security
   Treaty Between the United States and Japan, subsequently revised as
   Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and
   Japan in 1960, relations since then have been excellent. The United
   States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies, and it is both
   a Major Non-NATO ally and NATO contact country. The United States has
   several military bases in Japan including Yokosuka, which harbors the
   U.S. 7th Fleet. The JSDF, or Japanese Self Defense Force, cross train
   with the U.S. Military, often providing auxiliary security and
   conducting war games. When the U.S.President Barack Obama met with
   Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in 2009, he said the relationship with
   Japan as the "cornerstone of security in East Asia".^[24] After the
   several years of critical moment during Japan's Democratic Party
   administration, President Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
   reconfirmed the importance of its alliance and currently the U.S. and
   Japan negotiating to participate Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic
   Partnership.^[25]^[26]

South Korea[edit]

   Main article: South Korea–United States relations

   South Korea–United States relations have been most extensive since
   1945, when the United States helped establish capitalism in South Korea
   and led the UN-sponsored Korean War against North Korea and China
   (1950–1953).^[27] Stimulated by heavy American aid^[by whom?], South
   Korea's rapid economic growth, democratization and modernization
   greatly reduced its U.S. dependency. Large numbers of U.S. forces
   remain in Korea. At the 2009 G-20 London summit, U.S. President Barack
   Obama called South Korea "one of America's closest allies and greatest
   friends." ^[28]

China[edit]

   Main article: Sino-American relations
   President Barack Obama addresses the opening session of the first
   U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.

   American relations with the People's Republic of China are quite
   strong, yet complex. A great amount of trade between the two countries
   necessitates positive political relations, although occasional
   disagreements over tariffs, currency exchange rates and the Political
   status of Taiwan do occur. Nevertheless, the United States and China
   have an extremely extensive partnership. The U.S. criticizes China on
   human rights issues.

Taiwan[edit]

   Main article: Republic of China–United States relations

   Taiwan (officially the Republic of China), does not have official
   diplomatic relations with America and no longer receives diplomatic
   recognition from the State Department of the United States, but it
   conducts unofficial diplomatic relations through its de facto embassy,
   commonly known as the "American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)", and is
   considered to be a strong Asian ally and supporter of the United
   States.^[29]

ASEAN[edit]

   Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an important partner
   for United States in both economic and geostrategic aspects. ASEAN's
   geostrategic importance stems from many factors, including: the
   strategic location of member countries, the large shares of global
   trade that pass through regional waters, and the alliances and
   partnerships which the United States shares with ASEAN member states.
   In July 2009, the United States signed ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and
   Cooperation, which establishes guiding principles intended to build
   confidence among its signatories with the aim of maintaining regional
   peace and stability.^[30] Trade flows are robust and increasing between
   America and the ASEAN region. Since 2002 exports to the United States
   have gained 40% in value while U.S. exports to ASEAN increased
   62%.^[31]

Indonesia[edit]

   Main article: Indonesia–United States relations

   As the largest ASEAN member, Indonesia has played an active and
   prominent role in developing the organization.^[32] For United States,
   Indonesia is important for dealing with certain issues; such as
   terrorism,^[33] democracy, and how United States project its relations
   with Islamic world, since Indonesia has the world's largest Islamic
   population, and one that honors and respects religious diversity.^[34]
   US eyes Indonesia as potential strategic allies in Southeast Asia.^[35]
   During his stately visit to Indonesia, U.S. President Barack Obama has
   held up Indonesia as an example of how a developing nation can embrace
   democracy and diversity.^[36]^[37]

Malaysia[edit]

   Main article: Malaysia–United States relations

   Despite increasingly strained relations under the Mahathir Mohamad
   government, ties have been thawed under Najib Razak's administration.
   Economic ties are particularly robust, with the United States being
   Malaysia's largest trading partner and Malaysia is the tenth-largest
   trading partner of the U.S. Annual two-way trade amounts to $49
   billion. The United States and Malaysia launched negotiations for a
   bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) in June 2006.

   The United States and Malaysia enjoy strong security cooperation.
   Malaysia hosts the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counterterrorism
   (SEARCCT), where over 2000 officials from various countries have
   received training. The United States is among the foreign countries
   that has collaborated with the center in conducting capacity building
   programmes. The U.S. and Malaysia share a strong military-to-military
   relationship with numerous exchanges, training, joint exercises, and
   visits.

Myanmar[edit]

   Main article: Burma–United States relations

   Bilateral ties have generally been strained but are slowly improving.
   The United States has placed broad sanctions on Burma because of the
   military crackdown in 1988 and the military regime's refusal to honour
   the election results of the 1990 People's Assembly election. Similarly,
   the European Union has placed embargoes on Burma, including an arms
   embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with
   the exception of humanitarian aid.^[38]

   US and European government sanctions against the military government,
   alongside boycotts and other types direct pressure on corporations by
   western supporters of the Burmese democracy movement, have resulted in
   the withdrawal from Burma of most U.S. and many European companies.
   However, several Western companies remain due to loopholes in the
   sanctions.^[39] Asian corporations have generally remained willing to
   continue investing in Myanmar and to initiate new investments,
   particularly in natural resource extraction.

   Ongoing reforms have improved relations between Burma and the United
   States.

Philippines[edit]

   Main article: Philippines–United States relations

   The United States ruled the Philippines from 1898 to 1946. The Spanish
   government ceded the Philippines to the United States in the 1898
   Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish-American War. The United States
   finally recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946 in the
   Treaty of Manila.^[40] July 4 was observed in the Philippines as
   Independence Day until August 4, 1964 when, upon the advice of
   historians and the urging of nationalists, President Diosdado Macapagal
   signed into law Republic Act No. 4166 designating June 12 as the
   country's Independence Day.^[41] Since 2003 the U.S. has designated the
   Philippines as a Major Non-NATO Ally.

Thailand[edit]

   Main article: Thailand–United States relations

   Thailand and the US are both former Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
   (SEATO) members, being close partners throughout the Cold War, and are
   still close allies. Since 2003, the U.S. has designated the Thailand as
   a Major Non-NATO Ally.

Vietnam[edit]

   Main article: United States–Vietnam relations

   United States involved in Vietnam War in 1955 to 1975. In 1995,
   President Bill Clinton announced the formal normalization of diplomatic
   relations with Vietnam. Today US eyes Vietnam as a potential strategic
   ally in Southeast Asia.^[35]

Eastern Europe[edit]

   President Barack Obama talks with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk of
   Ukraine at the conclusion of their bilateral meeting in the Oval
   Office, March 12, 2014.
   U.S. Marines greet local Albanian boys in Kosovo on June 25, 1999

   American relations with Eastern Europe are influenced by the legacy of
   the Cold War. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, former
   Communist-bloc states in Europe have gradually transitioned to
   democracy and capitalism. Many have also joined the European Union and
   NATO, strengthening economic ties with the broader Western world and
   gaining the military protection of the United States via the North
   Atlantic Treaty.

Kosovo[edit]

   Main article: Kosovo–United States relations

   The UN Security Council remains divided on the question of Kosovo's
   declaration of independence. Kosovo declared its independence on
   February 17, 2008, whilst Serbia maintains that Kosovo is part of its
   territory. Of the five members with veto power in the UN Security
   Council, the USA, UK, and France recognized the declaration of
   independence, and China has expressed concern, while Russia considers
   it illegal. "In its declaration of independence, Kosovo committed
   itself to the highest standards of democracy, including freedom and
   tolerance and justice for citizens of all ethnic backgrounds", former
   President George W Bush of the US Republican party said on February 19,
   2008.^[42]^[43]

Hub and spoke vs multilateral[edit]

   While America's relationships with Europe have tended to be in terms of
   multilateral frameworks, such as NATO, America's relations with Asia
   have tended to be based on a series of bilateral relationships where
   the client states would coordinate with the United States in order to
   not have to deal directly with each other.^[citation needed] On May 30,
   2009, at the Shangri-La Dialogue Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates
   urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they
   established and grew multilateral institutions such as ASEAN, APEC and
   the ad hoc arrangements in the area.^[44] However in 2011 Gates said
   that the United States must serve as the "indispensable nation," for
   building multilateral cooperation.^[45]

Oil[edit]

Persian Gulf[edit]

   Further information: Energy policy of the United States and Petroleum
   politics
   A U.S. soldier stands guard duty near a burning oil well in the Rumaila
   oil field, Iraq, April 2003

   The U.S. currently produces about 40% of the oil that it consumes.
   While its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early
   1990s, new hydraulic fracturing techniques and discovery of shale oil
   deposits in Canada and the American Dakotas offer the potential for
   increased energy independence from oil exporting countries such as
   OPEC.^[46] Former U.S. President George W. Bush identified dependence
   on imported oil as an urgent "national security concern".^[47]

   Two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves are estimated to be found
   in the Persian Gulf.^[48]^[49] Despite its distance, the Persian Gulf
   region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United
   States during World War II. Petroleum is of central importance to
   modern armies, and the United States—as the world's leading oil
   producer at that time—supplied most of the oil for the Allied armies.
   Many U.S. strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously
   reduce the U.S. oil supply, and so they sought to establish good
   relations with Saudi Arabia, a kingdom with large oil reserves.^[50]

   The Persian Gulf region continued to be regarded as an area of vital
   importance to the United States during the Cold War. Three Cold War
   United States Presidential doctrines—the Truman Doctrine, the
   Eisenhower Doctrine, and the Nixon Doctrine—played roles in the
   formulation of the Carter Doctrine, which stated that the United States
   would use military force if necessary to defend its "national
   interests" in the Persian Gulf region.^[51] Carter's successor,
   President Ronald Reagan, extended the policy in October 1981 with what
   is sometimes called the "Reagan Corollary to the Carter Doctrine",
   which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect
   Saudi Arabia, whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the
   Iran–Iraq War.^[52] Some analysts have argued that the implementation
   of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Corollary also played a role in
   the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq War.^[53]^[54]^[55]^[56]

Canada[edit]

   Almost all of Canada's energy exports go to the United States, making
   it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports: Canada is
   consistently among the top sources for U.S. oil imports, and it is the
   largest source of U.S. natural gas and electricity imports.^[57]

Africa[edit]

   In 2007 the U.S. was Sub-Saharan Africa's largest single export market
   accounting for 28.4% of exports (second in total to the EU at 31.4%).
   81% of U.S. imports from this region were petroleum products.^[58]

Foreign aid[edit]

   Main articles: United States foreign aid and United States Agency for
   International Development

   Foreign assistance is a core component of the State Department's
   international affairs budget, which is $49 billion in all for
   2014.^[59] Aid is considered an essential instrument of U.S. foreign
   policy. There are four major categories of non-military foreign
   assistance: bilateral development aid, economic assistance supporting
   U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, and multilateral
   economic contributions (for example, contributions to the World Bank
   and International Monetary Fund).^[60]

   In absolute dollar terms, the United States government is the largest
   international aid donor ($23 billion in 2014).^[59] The U.S. Agency for
   International Development (USAID) manages the bulk of bilateral
   economic assistance; the Treasury Department handles most multilateral
   aid. In addition many private agencies, churches and philanthropies
   provide aid.

   Although the United States is the largest donor in absolute dollar
   terms, it is actually ranked 19 out of 27 countries on the Commitment
   to Development Index. The CDI ranks the 27 richest donor countries on
   their policies that affect the developing world. In the aid component
   the United States is penalized for low net aid volume as a share of the
   economy, a large share of tied or partially tied aid, and a large share
   of aid given to less poor and relatively undemocratic governments.

Military[edit]

   The United States has fought wars and intervened militarily on many
   occasions. See, Timeline of United States military operations. The U.S.
   also operates a vast network of military bases around the world. See,
   List of United States military bases.

   In recent years, the U.S. has used its military superiority as sole
   superpower to lead a number of wars, including, most recently, the
   invasion of Iraq in March 2003 as part of its global "War on Terror."

   The U.S. provides military aid through many different channels.
   Counting the items that appear in the budget as 'Foreign Military
   Financing' and 'Plan Colombia', the U.S. spent approximately $4.5
   billion in military aid in 2001, of which $2 billion went to Israel,
   $1.3 billion went to Egypt, and $1 billion went to Colombia.^[61] Since
   9/11, Pakistan has received approximately $11.5 billion in direct
   military aid.^[62]

   As of 2004, according to Fox News, the U.S. had more than 700 military
   bases in 130 different countries.^[63]

   Estimated US foreign military financing and aid by recipient for 2010:
         Recipient        Military aid (USD Billions)
    Iraq                  6.50
    Afghanistan           5.60^[64]

Missile defense[edit]

   Main articles: National missile defense and Strategic Defense
   Initiative

   The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a proposal by U.S. President
   Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983^[68] to use ground and space-based
   systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear
   ballistic missiles,^[69] later dubbed "Star Wars".^[70] The initiative
   focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense
   doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). Though it was never fully
   developed or deployed, the research and technologies of SDI paved the
   way for some anti-ballistic missile systems of today.^[71]

   In February 2007, the U.S. started formal negotiations with Poland and
   Czech Republic concerning construction of missile shield installations
   in those countries for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system^[72] (in
   April 2007, 57% of Poles opposed the plan).^[73] According to press
   reports the government of the Czech Republic agreed (while 67% Czechs
   disagree)^[74] to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a
   base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in
   Poland.^[75]^[76]

   Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia's
   border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to
   deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech
   Republic.^[77]^[78] In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if
   the Americans deployed the shield in Central Europe.^[79] Putin also
   said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under an
   Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United
   States.^[80]

   On August 14, 2008, The United States and Poland announced a deal to
   implement the missile defense system in Polish territory, with a
   tracking system placed in the Czech Republic.^[81] "The fact that this
   was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations
   between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia
   shows that, of course, the missile defense system will be deployed not
   against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia", Dmitry
   Rogozin, Russia's NATO envoy, said.^[72]^[82]

Exporting democracy[edit]

   See also: American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North
   Africa

   In United States history, critics have charged that presidents have
   used democracy to justify military intervention abroad.^[83]^[84]
   Critics have also charged that the U.S. helped local militaries
   overthrow democratically elected governments in Iran, Guatemala, and in
   other instances. Studies have been devoted to the historical success
   rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of
   American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall
   effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign
   nations.^[85] Until recently, scholars have generally agreed with
   international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts
   to export democracy have been "negligible, often counterproductive, and
   only occasionally positive."^[86]^[87] Other studies find U.S.
   intervention has had mixed results,^[85] and another by Hermann and
   Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in
   other countries.^[88]

Opinion that U.S. intervention does not export democracy[edit]

   Professor Paul W. Drake argued that the U.S. first attempted to export
   democracy in Latin America through intervention from 1912 to 1932.
   Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law
   defines intervention as "dictatorial interference in the affairs of
   another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things." The
   study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because
   democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions, and can not be
   forcibly imposed. There was disagreement about what constituted
   democracy; Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy
   in a narrow sense of a nation having elections; Drake suggested a
   broader understanding was needed. Further, there was disagreement about
   what constituted a "rebellion"; Drake saw a pattern in which the U.S.
   State Department disapproved of any type of rebellion, even so-called
   "revolutions", and in some instances rebellions against
   dictatorships.^[89] Historian Walter LaFeber stated, "The world's
   leading revolutionary nation (the U.S.) in the eighteenth century
   became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth
   century."^[90]

   Mesquita and Downs evaluated 35 U.S. interventions from 1945 to 2004
   and concluded that in only one case, Colombia, did a "full fledged,
   stable democracy" develop within ten years following the
   intervention.^[91] Samia Amin Pei argued that nation building in
   developed countries usually unravelled four to six years after American
   intervention ended. Pei, based on study of a database on worldwide
   democracies called Polity, agreed with Mesquita and Downs that U.S.
   intervention efforts usually don't produce real democracies, and that
   most cases result in greater authoritarianism after ten years.^[92]

   Professor Joshua Muravchik argued U.S. occupation was critical for Axis
   power democratization after World War II, but America's failure to
   encourage democracy in the third world "prove ... that U.S. military
   occupation is not a sufficient condition to make a country
   democratic."^[93]^[94] The success of democracy in former Axis
   countries such as Italy were seen as a result of high national
   per-capita income, although U.S. protection was seen as a key to
   stabilization and important for encouraging the transition to
   democracy. Steven Krasner agreed that there was a link between wealth
   and democracy; when per-capita incomes of $6,000 were achieved in a
   democracy, there was little chance of that country ever reverting to an
   autocracy, according to an analysis of his research in the Los Angeles
   Times.^[89]

Opinion that U.S. intervention has mixed results[edit]

   Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005,
   using Freedom House data. A plurality of interventions, 96, caused no
   change in the country's democracy. In 69 instances the country became
   less democratic after the intervention. In the remaining 63 cases, a
   country became more democratic.^[85] However this does not take into
   account the direction the country would have gone with no US
   intervention.

Opinion that U.S. intervention effectively exports democracy[edit]

   Hermann and Kegley found that American military interventions designed
   to protect or promote democracy increased freedom in those
   countries.^[88] Peceny argued that the democracies created after
   military intervention are still closer to an autocracy than a
   democracy, quoting Przeworski "while some democracies are more
   democratic than others, unless offices are contested, no regime should
   be considered democratic."^[95] Therefore, Peceny concludes, it is
   difficult to know from the Hermann and Kegley study whether U.S.
   intervention has only produced less repressive autocratic governments
   or genuine democracies.^[96]

   Peceny stated that the United States attempted to export democracy in
   33 of its 93 20th-century military interventions.^[97] Peceny argued
   that proliberal policies after military intervention had a positive
   impact on democracy.^[98]

Covert actions[edit]

   See also: Covert United States foreign regime change actions and Reagan
   Doctrine

   United States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple
   foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States. In
   1953 the CIA, working with the British government, initiated Operation
   Ajax against the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad
   Mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize Iran's oil, threatening the
   interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.^[99]

   A year later, in Operation PBSUCCESS, the United States government and
   the CIA toppled the democratically elected left-wing government of
   Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala and installed the military dictator Carlos
   Castillo Armas. The United Fruit Company lobbied for Árbenz overthrow
   as his land reforms jeopardized their land holdings in Guatemala, and
   painted these reforms as a communist threat. The coup triggered a
   decades long civil war which claimed the lives of 200,000 people.^[100]

   During the massacre of alleged communists in 1960s Indonesia, the U.S.
   government provided assistance to the Indonesian military that,
   according to Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor
   Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, helped
   facilitate the mass killings.^[101]^[102]^[103]^[104] This included the
   U.S. Embassy in Jakarta supplying Indonesian forces with lists of up to
   5,000 names of suspected PKI members, who were subsequently killed in
   the massacres.^[105]^[106]^[107]^[108]

   In 1970, the CIA worked with coup-plotters in Chile in the attempted
   kidnapping of General René Schneider, who was targeted for refusing to
   participate in a military coup upon the election of Salvador Allende.
   Schneider was shot in the botched attempt and died three days later.
   The CIA later paid the group $35,000 for the failed kidnapping.^[109]

Human Rights[edit]

   See also: United States support of authoritarian regimes and United
   States and state-sponsored terrorism

   The inclusion of Human Rights in U.S. foreign policy had a
   controversial start. For one thing, human rights driven foreign policy
   did not originate in the Executive branch but was instead enforced upon
   it by Congress, starting in the 1970s.^[110] Following the Vietnam War,
   the feeling that U.S. foreign policy had grown apart from traditional
   American values was seized upon by Senator Donald M. Fraser (D, MI),
   leading the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements,
   in criticizing Republican Foreign Policy under the Nixon
   administration. In the early 1970s, Congress concluded the Vietnam War
   and passed the War Powers Act. As "part of a growing assertiveness by
   Congress about many aspects of Foreign Policy,"^[111] Human Rights
   concerns became a battleground between the Legislative and the
   Executive branches in the formulation of foreign policy. David Forsythe
   points to three specific, early examples of Congress interjecting its
   own thoughts on foreign policy:
    1. Subsection (a) of the International Financial Assistance Act of
       1977: ensured assistance through international financial
       institutions would be limited to countries "other than those whose
       governments engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of
       internationally recognized human rights."^[111]
    2. Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in
       1984: reads in part, "No assistance may be provided under this part
       to the government of any country which engages in a consistent
       pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human
       rights."^[111]
    3. Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in
       1978: "No security assistance may be provided to any country the
       government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross
       violations of internationally recognized human rights."^[111]

   These measures were repeatedly used by Congress, with varying success,
   to affect U.S. foreign policy towards the inclusion of Human Rights
   concerns. Specific examples include El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala
   and South Africa. The Executive (from Nixon to Reagan) argued that the
   Cold War required placing regional security in favor of US interests
   over any behavioral concerns of national allies. Congress argued the
   opposite, in favor of distancing the United States from oppressive
   regimes.^[110] Nevertheless, according to historian Daniel Goldhagen,
   during the last two decades of the Cold War, the number of American
   client states practicing mass murder outnumbered those of the Soviet
   Union.^[112]

   On December 6, 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights
   when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.^[113] He also
   criticized Russia's law discriminating against gays,^[114] joining
   other western leaders in the boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in
   Russia.^[115]

   In June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that the United States played a key
   role in the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, both American
   citizens, shortly after the 1973 Chilean coup d'état.^[116]

War on Drugs[edit]

   Main article: War on Drugs

   United States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U.S.
   government to control imports of illicit drugs, including cocaine,
   heroin, methamphetamine, and cannabis. This is especially true in Latin
   America, a focus for the U.S. War on Drugs. Those efforts date back to
   at least 1880, when the U.S. and China completed an agreement that
   prohibited the shipment of opium between the two countries.

   Over a century later, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires
   the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit
   drug-producing countries. In September 2005,^[117] the following
   countries were identified: Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia,
   Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos,
   Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Two of
   these, Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U.S. considers to
   have failed to adhere to their obligations under international
   counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months. Notably
   absent from the 2005 list were Afghanistan, the People's Republic of
   China and Vietnam; Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that
   criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of
   MDMA destined for the United States and that large-scale cross-border
   trafficking of Canadian-grown cannabis continues. The U.S. believes
   that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and
   flow of MDMA to the U.S.

Criticism[edit]

   Main article: Criticism of American foreign policy
   Demonstration at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin against the NSA
   surveillance program PRISM, June 2013

   Critics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments
   or showed support for Israel. Others cite human rights abuses and
   violations of international law. Critics have charged that the U.S.
   presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention
   abroad.^[83]^[84] It was also noted that the U.S. overthrew
   democratically elected governments in Iran, Guatemala, and in other
   instances. Noam Chomsky, a vociferous critic of U.S. foreign policy,
   argues that "in both cases the consequences reach to the present" and
   that Guatemala in particular "remains one of the world’s worst horror
   chambers."^[118]

   Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in
   exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have
   been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to
   encourage democracy in foreign nations.^[85] Some scholars have
   generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham
   Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been "negligible,
   often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive."^[86]^[87]
   Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results,^[85] and
   another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions
   have improved democracy in other countries.^[88] A 2013 global poll in
   68 countries with 66,000 respondents by Win/Gallup found that the U.S.
   is perceived as the biggest threat to world peace.^[119]^[120]^[121]

Support[edit]

   Regarding support for certain anti-Communist dictatorships during the
   Cold War, a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil, with
   the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships.
   David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U.S. interests. Friendly
   tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center
   (though not in South Korea), while the 'realist' policy of coddling
   dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long
   memories.^[122]^[123]

   Many democracies have voluntary military ties with United States. See
   NATO, ANZUS, Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the
   United States and Japan, Mutual Defense Treaty with South Korea, and
   Major non-NATO ally. Those nations with military alliances with the
   U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S.
   protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less
   peaceful than those nations.^[124]^[125]

   Research on the democratic peace theory has generally found that
   democracies, including the United States, have not made war on one
   another. There have been U.S. support for coups against some
   democracies, but for example Spencer R. Weart argues that part of the
   explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were
   turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of
   rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes
   mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian
   leaders.^[126]

   Empirical studies (see democide) have found that democracies, including
   the United States, have killed much fewer civilians than
   dictatorships.^[127]^[128] Media may be biased against the U.S.
   regarding reporting human rights violations. Studies have found that
   The New York Times coverage of worldwide human rights violations
   predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where
   there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little
   coverage of the human rights violations in other nations.^[129]^[130]
   For example, the bloodiest war in recent time, involving eight nations
   and killing millions of civilians, was the Second Congo War, which was
   almost completely ignored by the media.

   Niall Ferguson argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all the
   human rights violations in nations they have supported. He writes that
   it is generally agreed that Guatemala was the worst of the US-backed
   regimes during the Cold War. However, the U.S. cannot credibly be
   blamed for all the 200,000 deaths during the long Guatemalan Civil
   War.^[123] The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military
   aid was cut for long periods because of such violations, that the U.S.
   helped stop a coup in 1993, and that efforts were made to improve the
   conduct of the security services.^[131]
   Bahraini pro-democracy protesters killed by the U.S.-allied regime,
   February 2011

   Today the U.S. states that democratic nations best support U.S.
   national interests. According to the U.S. State Department, "Democracy
   is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others.
   Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace,
   deter aggression, expand open markets, promote economic development,
   protect American citizens, combat international terrorism and crime,
   uphold human and worker rights, avoid humanitarian crises and refugee
   flows, improve the global environment, and protect human health."^[132]
   According to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, "Ultimately, the best
   strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
   support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack
   each other."^[133] In one view mentioned by the U.S. State Department,
   democracy is also good for business. Countries that embrace political
   reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve
   the productivity of businesses. Accordingly, since the mid-1980s, under
   President Ronald Reagan, there has been an increase in levels of
   foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative
   to countries that have not undertaken political reforms.^[134] Leaked
   cables in 2010 suggested that the "dark shadow of terrorism still
   dominates the United States' relations with the world".^[135]

   The United States officially maintains that it supports democracy and
   human rights through several tools ^[136] Examples of these tools are
   as follows:
     * A published yearly report by the State Department entitled
       "Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The U.S. Record" in
       compliance with a 2002 law (enacted and signed by President George
       W. Bush, which requires the Department to report on actions taken
       by the U.S. Government to encourage respect for human rights.^[137]
     * A yearly published "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices."
       ^[138]
     * In 2006 (under President George W. Bush), the United States created
       a "Human Rights Defenders Fund" and "Freedom Awards." ^[139]
     * The "Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award" recognizes the
       exceptional achievement of officers of foreign affairs agencies
       posted abroad.^[140]
     * The "Ambassadorial Roundtable Series", created in 2006, are
       informal discussions between newly confirmed U.S. Ambassadors and
       human rights and democracy non-governmental organizations.^[141]
     * The National Endowment for Democracy, a private non-profit created
       by Congress in 1983 (and signed into law by President Ronald
       Reagan, which is mostly funded by the U.S. Government and gives
       cash grants to strengthen democratic institutions around the world
