   Radio in the United States is a major mass medium. Unlike radio in most
   other countries, American radio has historically relied on commercial
   sponsorship rather than public funding.

History[edit]

   In 1912, most amateur-radio transmissions were restricted to
   wavelengths below 200 meters (i.e., frequencies above 1500 kHz) to
   prevent interference to future commercial broadcasters.^[1] The
   beginning of regular, commercially licensed radio broadcasting in the
   United States in 1920, along with the concurrent development of sound
   and color film in that decade, ended the print monopoly of mass media
   and opened the doors to the immediate (and pervasive) electronic media.
   By 1928, the United States had three national radio networks: two owned
   by NBC (the National Broadcasting Company), and one by CBS (the
   Columbia Broadcasting System). Until 1943, there were four major
   national radio networks: two owned by NBC, one owned by CBS and one
   owned by Mutual Broadcasting System. NBC's second network became ABC,
   the American Broadcasting Company.

   Though mostly listened to for entertainment,^[2] radio's instant,
   on-the-spot reports of dramatic events drew large audiences throughout
   the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. President Franklin
   D. Roosevelt recognized the potential of radio to reach the American
   public, and during his four terms (1933â€“45) his radio "fireside chats"
   informed the nation on the progress of policies to counter the
   Depression and on developments during World War II.

   After World War II, television's visual images replaced the audio-only
   limitation of radio as the predominant entertainment and news vehicle.
   Radio adapted by replacing entertainment programs with schedules of
   music interspersed with news and features, a free-form format adopted
   by NBC when it launched its popular weekend-long Monitor in 1955.
   During the 1950s automobile manufacturers began offering car radios as
   standard accessories, and radio received a boost as Americans listened
   to their car radios as they drove to and from work.

   In the 1950s, as a result of television's increased popularity coupled
   with dramatically loosened restrictions on playing recorded music on
   air, the network model of radio dramatically declined. In its place was
   the first music radio format: top 40, the forerunner to modern
   contemporary hit radio. Top 40 stations could be operated locally and
   gave rise to the disc jockeys, who became prominent local celebrities
   in their own right. Top 40 became the outlet for the relatively new
   style of music known as rock and roll.

   FM radio, which was the successor to the failed Apex band (also known
   as ultra-shortwave) experiments of the 1930s, arrived in the United
   States after World War II, but it was not until the 1960s that it
   became widely popular. The first FM stations were primarily
   instrumental, featuring formats that would come to be known as easy
   listening and beautiful music, and were targeted at shopping centers.
   Other, later FM sign-ons became known for experimentation; the early
   freeform stations eventually evolved into progressive rock, the first
   radio format designed specifically to showcase rock music. From
   progressive rock came album-oriented rock, which in turn spawned the
   modern formats of classic rock, active rock and adult album
   alternative.

   Top 40 radio would begin arriving on the FM band in the 1970s as FM
   reached critical mass. As the amount of archival music from the rock
   and roll era began to expand, oldies radio stations began to appear,
   later evolving into the modern classic hits and later adult hits
   formats. FM radio made a major expansion in the late 1980s with the
   FCC's Docket 80-90, which expanded the number of available FM licenses
   in the suburban areas of the United States. Country music in
   particular, previously only heard on rural AM stations particularly in
   the Southern and Western United States, benefited from this docket,
   moving en masse to FM; the beautiful music and easy listening formats
   mostly died out, with adult contemporary music taking its place.

   Meanwhile, the AM band began declining. All-news radio became popular
   in the major cities in the late 1960s. As each successive radio format
   moved to FM, AM radio stations were left with fewer and fewer options.
   One of the last "AM only" formats was MOR, or "middle-of-the-road", the
   direct forerunner of adult contemporary music and adult standards. Talk
   radio, although it had a small following in the cities, did not achieve
   mainstream popularity until the 1980s, when a combination of factors
   led to the rise of conservative talk radio. The politically charged
   format swept the country, bringing stardom to one of its pioneers, Rush
   Limbaugh. Also rising to popularity in the late 1980s was sports radio,
   which was dedicated to talk about sports as well as the broadcasting of
   sports events. What few country stations remained on AM typically
   shifted to classic country and focused primarily on older music.

   While shock jocks had been in existence since at least the 1970s (see,
   for example, Don Imus) and the morning zoo radio format was popular
   among local stations beginning in the 1980s, the first shock jock to
   make a major national impact was Howard Stern, whose New York-based
   show was syndicated nationwide beginning in the early 1990s. Stern
   built a multimedia empire that incorporated television, books and
   feature films, which led to him bestowing upon himself the title of
   "King of All Media." Stern left terrestrial radio in 2005.

   Satellite networks began replacing landline-based models in the 1980s,
   making possible wider and quicker national distribution of both talk
   and music radio. At the same time, the traditional networks started
   collapsing: NBC Radio and Mutual both were acquired by syndication
   company Westwood One, while ABC (both radio and television) was
   acquired by Capital Cities Communications. CBS would later acquire
   Westwood One, only to spin it off in 2007. ABC would end up in the
   hands of The Walt Disney Company, who broke it up in 2007; Disney owns
   portions of the old network, while the rest of it is in the hands of
   Cumulus Media. NBC (along with Westwood One) is currently in the hands
   of Townsquare Media. Mutual was dissolved in 1999, replaced by CNN
   Radio, which itself was dissolved in 2012. CBS, which still owns much
   of its network, splits its programming between Cumulus and Townsquare.

   Only one other major network has appeared since the 1990s: Premiere
   Networks, the division of Clear Channel Communications. Premiere owns
   the radio distribution rights to the current "fourth major network",
   Fox (which owns no radio stations), and distributes that company's news
   and sports radio broadcasts. Clear Channel benefited from the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed for greater media
   consolidation, and built a large empire of both large and small market
   radio stations; Clear Channel, having overextended itself, jettisoned
   most of its small-market stations (as well as its now-dissolved
   television division) in the late 2000s.

   Direct-to-consumer subscription satellite radio began appearing in the
   United States in the early 2000s, but despite heavy investment in
   programming has continually lost money and has less than a tenth of the
   reach of terrestrial radio. The two competing satellite radio services,
   Sirius and XM, merged to form Sirius XM Radio in 2009 and now has a
   government-regulated monopoly on the format.

Broadcast call signs[edit]

   Further information: List of radio stations in North America by media
   market

   While broadcast radio stations will often brand themselves with
   plain-text names, identities such as "cool FM", "rock 105" or "the ABC
   network" are not unique. Another station, in another city or country,
   may (and often will) have a similar brand; the name of a broadcast
   station for legal purposes is, therefore, normally its ITU call sign.

   Broadcast stations in North America generally use call letters in the
   international series, with common conventions followed in each country.
   In the United States, the first letter generally is K for stations west
   of the Mississippi River and W for those east of the Mississippi; all
   new call signs have had four characters since 1922, although there are
   historical three-character calls still in use (such as WOR in New York
   City, WBZ in Boston, WOL in Washington DC, WSB in Atlanta, WSM in
   Nashville, WMC in Memphis, WGN in Chicago, KLZ and KOA in Denver, KSL
   in Salt Lake City, KEX in Portland, Oregon, KFI in Los Angeles and KGU
   in Hawaii).^[3] The ITU has allocated call signs starting with N, as
   well as AA through AN, to the United States, but those prefixes are not
   in use on any AM or FM radio station.

   There are exceptions to the eastâ€“west rule (such as KDKA in Pittsburgh
   and WFAA in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas); these are historical artifacts
   from a rule change in the 1930s, and most of the exceptions are located
   in the states immediately adjacent to the river. The westernmost
   station in the continental United States beginning with W is WOAI in
   San Antonio, Texas. WVUV-LP in Pago Pago, American Samoa is the
   westernmost station with a W call sign. KYW in Philadelphia is the
   easternmost station on the U.S. mainland with a K call sign; the radio
   stations on Saipan are the easternmost stations with K call signs
   overall.

   Maryland

   state of Maryland (now in Colorado)

   All time-broadcasting stations have a three- or four-letter call sign,
   beginning with WWV. The three current government-operated time stations
   (WWV, longwave sister station WWVB and WWVH) are located in Fort
   Collins, Colorado and Kekaha, Hawaii respectively, so all would
   normally use call signs beginning with K.

   The US government-operated international broadcaster Voice of America
   no longer has call signs assigned to it; in contrast, Radio Canada
   International's transmitter in Sackville, New Brunswick was still
   assigned CKCX-SW until its 2012 shutdown. Privately operated shortwave
   stations (such as WWCR and CFRX) also have call signs.

Modern era[edit]

   The expansion and dominance of FM radio, which has better audio quality
   but a more-limited broadcast range than AM, represented the major
   technical change in radio during the 1970s and 1980s. FM radio (aided
   by the development of smaller portable radios and "Walkman" headsets)
   dominates music programming, while AM has largely shifted to talk and
   news formats. Talk radio became more popular during the 1980s as a
   result of improved satellite communications, the repeal of the Fairness
   Doctrine and (by the mid-1990s) extensive concentration of media
   ownership stemming from the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While
   before the 1980s talk radio was primarily a local phenomenon, the
   development of national spoken-word programming contributed to the
   renewed popularity of AM radio. However, this popularity is fading as
   previously AM-only stations begin moving their operations to FM
   simulcasts or translators.

   Both FM and AM radio have become increasingly specialized. Music
   formats (for instance) comprise a variety of specializations, the top
   five in 1991 being "country and western", "adult contemporary", "Top
   40", "religion" and "oldies". Radio has been shaped by demographics,
   although to a lesser degree than television; modern radio formats
   target groups of people by age, gender, urban (or rural) setting and
   race. As such, freeform stations with broad-spanning playlists have
   become uncommon on commercial radio.

   In an era in which TV is the predominant medium, the reach of radio is
   still extensive. Ninety-nine percent of American households in 1999 had
   at least one radio; the average is five per household. Every day, radio
   reaches 80 percent of the U.S. population. Revenue more than doubled in
   a decade, from $8.4 billion in 1990 to more than $17 billion in 2000.
   Radio continues to prevail in automobiles and offices, where attention
   can be kept on the road (or the task at hand) while radio is an audio
   background. The popularity of car radios has led to drive time being
   the most listened-to dayparts on most radio stations, followed by
   midday (or the "at work" shift). Transistor radios, a technology that
   has been available since the 1950s, were the method of choice for
   listening to music on the go for most of the late 20th century, before
   digital media players and later smartphones (many of which have FM
   radios as part of their hardware) took those roles in the 20th century.

   The majority of programming in the United States is in English, with
   Spanish the second-most popular broadcast language; these are the only
   two languages with domestically produced, national radio networks. In
   the largest urban areas of the United States, "world ethnic" stations
   may be found with a wide variety of languages (including Russian,
   Chinese, Korean and the languages of India); relatively widespread
   languages French and German have comparatively few radio outlets (in
   the case of German, due to the fact that most of its speakers are Amish
   or from similar sects and thus shun radio technology). French speakers
   can generally receive programming direct from Canadian broadcasters,
   which are receivable near the Canadian border, and a handful of local
   stations serving the Haitian diaspora and Creole populations also serve
   areas in the southeast.

   Until the 1980s, most commercial radio stations were affiliated with
   large networks such as Capital Cities/ABC, CBS, Mutual Network, NBC,
   and others (e.g., RKO in the 1980s). The traditional major networks
   that had dominated the history of American radio up to that point began
   to be dissolved in the 1980s; RKO was forced to break up in a billing
   scandal, while NBC Radio and Mutual sold their assets to up-and-coming
   syndicator Westwood One, which itself would be bought by rival CBS in
   the 1990s. ABC maintained most of its radio network until 2007, when it
   sold off most of its stations to Citadel Broadcasting (it maintains two
   specialty networks, sports-oriented ESPN Radio and youth top 40 Radio
   Disney). CBS sold off Westwood One to private equity interests in the
   late 2000s as well, but unlike its rivals maintained ownership of its
   flagship stations. As of 2012, most commercial radio stations are
   controlled by media conglomerates and private equity firms such as Bain
   Capital (Clear Channel Communications), Oaktree Capital Management
   (Townsquare Media) and Cumulus Media.

Public radio[edit]

   The United States government directly produces two radio services for
   direct public consumption: WWV (a time signal service on shortwave) and
   NOAA Weather Radio (a weather radio and emergency information network).
   Both services are almost entirely automated and use synthesized voice
   recordings. Unlike most other English-language countries, the United
   States does not have a federal government-owned national broadcaster,
   and the country's international government-operated broadcasters
   overseen by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (the most widely known
   being Voice of America) were expressly forbidden from being marketed to
   American citizens until 2013 and still neither owns nor affiliates with
   any AM or FM station. In lieu of a national broadcaster, the United
   States government instead subsidizes nonprofit radio stations through
   the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

   In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to
   4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460
   public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities
   and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by
   public and/or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting.
   Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National
   Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public
   Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also
   created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately
   from each other.) The BBC World Service has been distributed in the
   United States since 1986; until July 2012 by PRI, and since then by
   APM.^[4] It is also possible to listen to the World Service on
   shortwave.

   The United States government has the direct authority to assume control
   over all radio stations in the United States at any time by way of the
   Emergency Alert System. All radio stations are required to have EAS
   equipment installed and operational in the event such a takeover is
   implemented. However, in practice (as evidenced when the EAS attempted
   its first ever national test on November 9, 2011), the EAS as currently
   configured is not entirely effective and produces poor audio quality.
   Other than the 2011 test, the EAS has never been used on a national
   scale.

Recent developments[edit]

   A new form of radio which is gaining popularity is satellite radio.
   Sirius XM Radio has a monopoly on the technology after the merger of
   Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio. Unlike terrestrial-radio
   broadcasting, most channels feature few (or no) commercials.
   Satellite-radio content is not regulated by the Federal Communications
   Commission (FCC).

   Cable radio, a slightly older technology, has also become widespread;
   Music Choice is the market leader in this field, with its primary
   competitors being Sirius XM, Muzak, DMX, Sonic Tap and Canada-based
   Galaxie. CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks specialize in talk radio.
   Cable radio has the disadvantage that it requires a cable hookup,
   limiting its use outside the home.

   Unlike the mandated digital television transition, the U.S. government
   has not mandated a transition to digital radio, although it allows
   digital radio to be broadcast. The national standard is HD Radio, a
   proprietary in-band on-channel format that allows digital and analog
   signals to be broadcast simultaneously. Radio companies aggressively
   marketed HD Radio throughout the 2000s, touting its clearer signal and
   capacity for digital subchannels, but the technology never caught on
   with the general public, primarily due to cost, signal reception
   problems, a general lack of quality programming on the subchannels, and
   (especially on AM HD stations) adjacent-channel interference. HD
   Radio's primary use has been to exploit an FCC loophole to allow
   low-power broadcast translators to carry HD subchannels in analog, thus
   giving radio station groups the ability to program more program
   services in a market than the federally mandated maximum number of
   stations allowed. FMeXtra is another subchannel service authorized for
   use in the United States, although that service is generally limited to
   voice transmissions due to lower bandwidth.

   Internet radio, digital music players and streaming-capable smartphones
   are a challenge to terrestrial radio. Unlike satellite radio, most
   Internet stations do not require a subscription; several of the more
   popular ones use algorithms which allow listeners to customize the
   music they want to hear and select new music which may interest them.
   The proliferation of internet-based stations (which are more numerous
   and easier to set up than their television counterparts) creates a
   threat of audience fracturing beyond that experienced by television due
   to cable and satellite providers; the recording industry also sees
   Internet radio as a threat and has attempted to impose high royalty
   rates for the use of recorded music to discourage independent stations
   from playing popular songs.

   Although not nearly to the extent that AM radio has declined in
   neighboring Canada, AM radio has also begun to decline in the United
   States. To partially combat this, radio ownership groups have
   increasingly moved their signals to FM, either through low-power
   broadcast translators (primarily on small, independent and/or rural
   stations) or through simulcast on full-market FM stations. The AM-to-FM
   phenomenon began primarily in mid-sized markets, where there is more
   bandwidth and less competition, but has since progressed even to New
   York City, where as of 2012 sports-talk AM stations WEPN and WFAN have
   both acquired FM stations with the intent to either move or simulcast
   their AM programming. By 2013 most of the AM/FM simulcasts had been
   discontinued, in part due to redundancy and the fact that most
   listeners to AM stations stayed with AM while very few new listeners
   were picked up on the FM side.
