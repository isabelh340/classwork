   The Fifth Amendment (Amendment V) to the United States Constitution is
   part of the Bill of Rights and protects against unfair treatment in
   legal processes.

   The Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon indictment by a
   grand jury; the Grand Jury Clause is one of the few provisions of the
   Bill of Rights not held to have been a directly or strictly
   incorporated in the states under civil law, though it serves as a model
   for the level of substantive due process required to meet the burden of
   due process. The grand jury is a pre-constitutional common law
   institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively
   embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent
   that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most
   states have an alterative civil process. "Although state systems of
   criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is
   similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important
   role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688]
   majority of the States." Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. The
   Amendment also provides several trial protections, including the right
   against self-incrimination (held to also apply to custodial
   interrogations and before most government bodies) as well as the right
   to be tried only once ("double jeopardy") in federal court for the same
   offense. The Amendment also has a Due Process Clause (similar to the
   one in the 14th Amendment) as well as an implied equal protection
   requirement (Bolling v. Sharpe). Finally, the Amendment requires that
   the power of eminent domain be coupled with "just compensation" for
   those whose property is taken.

Text[edit]

     No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
     infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand
     Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the
     Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor
     shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in
     jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal
     case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life,
     liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private
     property be taken for public use, without just compensation.^[1]

Infamous crime[edit]

   Whether a crime is "infamous" is determined by the nature of the
   punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually
   imposed;^[2] however, crimes punishable by death must be tried upon
   indictments. The historical origin of "infamous crime" comes from the
   infamia, an extreme punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was
   deprived his citizenship.^[3]^[4] In United States v. Moreland, 258
   U.S. 433 (1922), the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison
   or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house,
   attaches infamy to a crime. In Mackin v. United States, 117 U.S. 348
   (1886), the Supreme Court judged that "'Infamous crimes' are thus, in
   the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by
   imprisonment in the penitentiary.'", while it later in Green v. United
   States 356 U.S. 165 (1957), stated that "imprisonment in a penitentiary
   can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one
   year". Therefore an infamous crime is one that is punished by
   imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney
   and Professor of Law at the University of Dayton School of Law,
   concluded: "Since this is essentially the definition of a felony,
   infamous crimes translate as felonies."^[5]

Grand jury[edit]

   Further information: Grand juries in the United States

   Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are
   composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation
   proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by
   the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in
   other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For
   example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence
   presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence
   obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot
   be introduced in court.^[6] Also, an individual does not have the right
   to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An
   individual would have such a right during questioning by the police
   while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is
   free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his or her attorney
   outside the room before returning to answer a question.
   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives.

   Currently, federal law permits the trial of misdemeanors without
   indictments.^[7] Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the
   prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive
   their Fifth Amendment right.

   Grand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in
   limited circumstances. In Ex Parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 (1887), the Supreme
   Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the
   prosecution. United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130 (1985) partly
   reversed Ex parte Bain; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by
   the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new
   charges may not be added.

   The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those
   serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime.
   Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are
   not protected under the clause either. In O'Callahan v. Parker, 395
   U.S. 258 (1969), the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to
   service may be brought against members of the militia without
   indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held
   that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any
   offense without indictments.^[8]

   The grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been
   incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment.^[9] This means that the
   grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal
   court system. While many states do employ grand juries, no defendant
   has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in
   state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though
   not all) have replaced them with preliminary hearing.

Double jeopardy[edit]

   Main article: Double Jeopardy Clause

          [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be
          twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ...^[10]

   The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions:
   subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after
   conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and
   multiple punishment in the same indictment.^[11] Jeopardy "attaches"
   when the jury is empaneled in a jury trial, when the first witness is
   sworn in during a bench trial, or when a plea is accepted
   unconditionally.^[12]

   Prosecution after acquittal

   The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry
   of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is
   submitted to the jury,^[13] a directed verdict after a deadlocked
   jury,^[14] an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct
   appeal to a higher appellate court),^[15] or an "implied acquittal" via
   conviction of a lesser included offense.^[16] In addition, the
   government is barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against
   the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior
   acquittal,^[17] even if the jury hung on other counts.^[18]

   This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a
   pre-trial motion to dismiss^[19] or other non-merits dismissal,^[20] or
   a directed verdict after a jury conviction,^[21] nor does it prevent
   the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a
   directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or
   statute.^[22] Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the
   defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency,^[23]
   including habeas,^[24] or "thirteenth juror" appellate reversals
   notwithstanding sufficiency^[25] on the principle that jeopardy has not
   "terminated." There is also an exception for judicial bribery in a
   bench trial.^[26]

   Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction

   In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court announced the
   following test: the government may separately try and punish the
   defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the
   other does not.^[27] Blockburger is the default rule, unless the
   legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal
   Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,^[28]
   as can conspiracy.^[29]

   The Blockburger test, originally developed in the multiple punishments
   context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.^[30] In
   Grady v. Corbin (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation
   could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied,^[31] but
   Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon (1993).^[32]

   Prosecution after mistrial

   The rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the
   defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the
   prosecutor acted in "bad faith," i.e. goaded the defendant into moving
   for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a
   mistrial.^[33] If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar
   to retrial if the trial judge finds "manifest necessity" for granting
   the mistrial.^[34] The same standard governs mistrials granted sua
   sponte.

Self-incrimination[edit]

   The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to
   incriminate themselves. Incriminating oneself is defined as exposing
   oneself (or another person) to "an accusation or charge of crime," or
   as involving oneself (or another person) "in a criminal prosecution or
   the danger thereof."^[35] The privilege against compelled
   self-incrimination is defined as "the constitutional right of a person
   to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against
   himself or herself. ... "^[36] To "plead the Fifth" is to refuse to
   answer any question because "the implications of the question, in the
   setting in which it is asked" lead a claimant to possess a "reasonable
   cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer", believing that "a
   responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be
   answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could
   result."^[37]

   Historically, the legal protection against compelled self-incrimination
   was directly related to the question of torture for extracting
   information and confessions.^[38]^[39]

   The legal shift away from widespread use of torture and forced
   confession dates to turmoil of the late 16th and early 17th century in
   England.^[40] Anyone refusing to take the oath ex officio mero
   (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any
   charges) was considered guilty.^[40] Suspected Puritans were pressed to
   take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and
   torture were commonly used to compel "cooperation." Puritans, who were
   at the time fleeing to the New World, began a practice of refusing to
   cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case John Lilburne
   refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for "freeborn
   rights" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced
   self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. Oliver Cromwell's
   revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in
   response to a popular group of English citizens known as the Levellers.
   The Levellers presented The Humble Petition of Many Thousands to
   Parliament in 1647 with 13 demands, third of which was the right
   against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were
   brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the
   United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.

   Protection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the
   Miranda rights statement, which protects the "right to remain silent."
   This amendment is also similar to Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of
   Rights and Freedoms. In other Commonwealth of Nations countries like
   Australia and New Zealand, the right to silence of the accused both
   during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right
   inherited from common law, and is protected in the New Zealand Bill of
   Rights Act and in Australia through various federal and state acts and
   codes governing the criminal justice system.

   In South African law the right to silence originating from English
   common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the
   Republic of South Africa, 1996.

   The Supreme Court has held that "a witness may have a reasonable fear
   of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege
   serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by
   ambiguous circumstances."^[41]

Legal proceeding[edit]

   The Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination
   applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal
   proceeding.^[42] The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies
   whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the incorporation
   doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court,^[43] and
   whether the proceeding itself is criminal or civil.^[44]

   The right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or congressional
   hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the House
   Committee on Un-American Activities or the Senate Internal Security
   Subcommittee claimed the right in response to questions concerning
   their alleged membership in the Communist Party. Under the Red Scare
   hysteria at the time of McCarthyism, witnesses who refused to answer
   the questions were accused as "fifth amendment communists". They lost
   jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and
   suffered other repercussions after "taking the Fifth."

   Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisc.) asked, "Are you now, or have you ever
   been a member of the Communist party," while he was chairman of the
   Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on
   Investigations. Admitting to a previous communist party membership was
   not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to "name names," to
   implicate others they knew to be communists or who had been communists
   in the past. Academy Award winning director Elia Kazan testified before
   the House Committee on Un-American Activities that he had belonged to
   the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also "named names," which
   incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as Zero
   Mostel found themselves on a Hollywood blacklist after taking the
   Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in the show business.

   The amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in
   criminal cases involving the Mafia.^[citation needed]

   The privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual
   who testifies before a non-governmental, self-regulatory
   organization—such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)—and the SRO
   provides information about that testimony to law enforcement agencies
   who then prosecute the individual, even though the SRO has the power to
   suspend the individual from its membership. An SRO itself is not a
   court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE
   and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), are
   generally not considered to be state actors. See United States v.
   Solomon,^[45] D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.,^[46]
   and Marchiano v. NASD,^[47] SROs also lack subpoena powers, so they
   rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the
   threat of a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD)
   when the individual asserts his or her Fifth Amendment privilege
   against compelled self-incrimination.

Custodial interrogation[edit]

   The Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by
   law enforcement officers. Originally, at common law, even a confession
   obtained by torture was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century,
   common law in England provided that coerced confessions were
   inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by
   the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions
   based on such confessions, in cases such as Brown v. Mississippi, 297
   U.S. 278 (1936).

   Law enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but
   the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve
   physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible.
   In Chambers v. Florida (1940) the Court held a confession obtained
   after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the
   defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In Ashcraft v.
   Tennessee (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for
   thirty-six hours under electric lights. In Haynes v. Washington,^[48]
   the Court held that an "unfair and inherently coercive context"
   including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.

   Miranda v. Arizona (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions.
   Ernesto Miranda had signed a statement confessing the crime, but the
   Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the
   defendant had not been advised of his rights.

   The Court held, "the prosecution may not use statements ... stemming
   from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates
   the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege
   against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law
   enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise
   deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the
   specifics of the crime.

   As for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully
   effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of
   silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the
   following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person
   must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement
   he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a
   right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed."
   The warning to which Chief Justice Earl Warren referred is now called
   the Miranda warning, and it is customarily delivered by the police to
   an individual before questioning.

   Miranda has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings.
   For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted
   under "custodial" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under
   arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a
   person who is under the reasonable belief that he may not freely leave
   from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in
   "custody." That determination of "reasonableness" is based on a
   totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police
   station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required.
   Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age
   can be an objective factor. In Yarborough v. Alvarado (2004), the Court
   held that "a state-court decision that failed to mention a
   17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not
   objectively unreasonable".^[49] In her concurring opinion Justice
   O'Connor wrote that a suspect's age may indeed "be relevant to the
   'custody' inquiry";^[50] the Court did not find it relevant in the
   specific case of Alvarado. The Court affirmed that age could be a
   relevant and objective factor in J.D.B. v. North Carolina where they
   ruled that "so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the
   time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to
   a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is
   consistent with the objective nature of that test"^[49]

   The questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights.
   For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to
   elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute
   questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the
   prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually
   made.

   A confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary
   cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a
   judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a
   defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the
   crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility,
   to "impeach" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the
   warning.

   In Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, the Supreme Court
   ruled 5–4 on June 21, 2004 that the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth
   Amendments do not give people the right to refuse to give their name
   when questioned by police where a state's stop and identify statutes
   obligate disclosure of such information.

   In June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in Berghuis v. Thompkins that
   criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain
   silent. Unless and until the suspect actually states that they are
   relying on that right, their subsequent voluntary statements can be
   used in court and police can continue to interact with (or question)
   them. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to
   imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary
   reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as implying a waiver.

The Act of Production Doctrine[edit]

   Under the Act of Production Doctrine, the act of an individual in
   producing documents or materials (e.g., in response to a subpoena) may
   have a "testimonial aspect" for purposes of the individual's right to
   assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to the
   extent that the individual's act of production provides information not
   already in the hands of law enforcement personnel about the (1)
   existence; (2) custody; or (3) authenticity, of the documents or
   materials produced. See United States v. Hubbell.

Refusal to testify in a criminal case[edit]

   In Griffin v. California, the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may
   not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's
   refusal to testify in his own defense. The Court overturned as
   unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the
   California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to
   prosecutors.^[51]

Refusal to testify in a civil case[edit]

   While defendants are entitled to assert the privilege against compelled
   self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the
   assertion of the privilege in such an action.

   The Supreme Court has held that "the Fifth Amendment does not forbid
   adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to
   testify in response to probative evidence offered against them." Baxter
   v. Palmigiano,^[52] "[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a
   unanimous court in the Tod case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most
   persuasive character.'"^[53] "'Failure to contest an assertion ... is
   considered evidence of acquiescence ... if it would have been natural
   under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'"^[54]

   In Baxter, the state was entitled to an adverse inference against
   Palmigiano because of the evidence against him and his assertion of the
   Fifth Amendment privilege.

   Some civil cases are considered "criminal cases" for the purposes of
   the Fifth Amendment. In Boyd v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court
   stated that "A proceeding to forfeit a person's goods for an offence
   against the laws, though civil in form, and whether in rem or in
   personam, is a "criminal case" within the meaning of that part of the
   Fifth Amendment which declares that no person "shall be compelled, in
   any criminal case, to be a witness against himself."^[55]

Federal income tax[edit]

   In some cases, individuals may be legally required to file reports that
   call for information that may be used against them in criminal cases.
   In United States v. Sullivan,^[56] the United States Supreme Court
   ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's
   protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income
   tax return. The Court stated: "If the form of return provided called
   for answers that the defendant was privileged from making[,] he could
   have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account
   refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what,
   if anything, he might have withheld."^[57]

   In Garner v. United States,^[58] the defendant was convicted of crimes
   involving a conspiracy to "fix" sporting contests and to transmit
   illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence,
   the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one
   return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be "professional
   gambler." In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from
   "gambling" or "wagering." The prosecution used this to help contradict
   the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer
   tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax
   returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally
   required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being
   compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed
   that he was legally required to report the illegal income on the
   returns, but ruled that the privilege against self-incrimination still
   did not apply. The Court stated that "if a witness under compulsion to
   testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the privilege, the
   Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself."^[59]

   Sullivan and Garner are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the
   proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer
   would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but
   might validly claim the privilege by labeling the item "Fifth
   Amendment" (instead of "illegal gambling income," "illegal drug sales,"
   etc.)^[60] The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
   has stated: "Although the source of income might be privileged, the
   amount must be reported."^[61] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth
   Circuit has stated: ". ... the amount of a taxpayer's income is not
   privileged even though the source of income may be, and Fifth Amendment
   rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws "by simply
   listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for
   'miscellaneous' income on his tax form."^[62] In another case, the
   Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: "While the source of
   some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged,
   assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he
   had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the amount of his income
   was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it."^[63] In
   1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: "A
   careful reading of Sullivan and Garner, therefore, is that the
   self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer
   from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but
   does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income."^[64]

Grants of immunity[edit]

   If the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual
   may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be "transactional immunity"
   or "use immunity"; in the former, the witness is immune from
   prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the
   witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against
   him. In Kastigar v. United States,^[65] the Supreme Court held that the
   government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use
   immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the
   witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most
   commonly arises in cases related to organized crime.

Record keeping[edit]

   A statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that
   it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A
   three part test laid out by Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control
   Board,^[66] is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly
   selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the
   activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal
   statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely
   regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of
   prosecution and is used against the record-keeper. In this case, the
   Supreme Court struck down an order by the Subversive Activities Control
   Board requiring members of the Communist Party to register with the
   government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against
   self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order
   had been issued was "directed at a highly selective group inherently
   suspect of criminal activities."

   In Leary v. United States,^[67] the court struck down the Marijuana Tax
   Act because its record keeping statute required self-incrimination.

   In Haynes v. United States,^[68] the Supreme Court ruled that, because
   convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons
   to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of
   self-incrimination and was therefore unconstitutional.

Computer passwords[edit]

   Courts have given conflicting decisions on whether forced disclosure of
   computer passwords is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

   In In re Boucher (2009), the US District Court of Vermont ruled that
   the Fifth Amendment might protect a defendant from having to reveal an
   encryption password, or even the existence of one, if the production of
   that password could be deemed a self-incriminating "act" under the
   Fifth Amendment. In Boucher, production of the unencrypted drive was
   deemed not to be a self-incriminating act, as the government already
   had sufficient evidence to tie the encrypted data to the
   defendant.^[69]

   In January 2012 a federal judge in Denver ruled that a bank-fraud
   suspect was required to give an unencrypted copy of a laptop hard drive
   to prosecutors.^[70]^[71] However, in February 2012 the Eleventh
   Circuit ruled otherwise - finding that requiring a defendant to produce
   an encrypted drive's password would violate the Constitution, becoming
   the first federal circuit court to rule on the issue.^[72]^[73] In
   April 2013, a District Court magistrate judge in Wisconsin refused to
   compel a suspect to provide the encryption password to his hard drive
   after FBI agents had unsuccessfully spent months trying to decrypt the
   data.^[74]^[75]

Other[edit]

   Corporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records;
   the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against
   self-incrimination extend only to "natural persons."^[76] The Court has
   also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to
   produce corporate documents even if the act of production would
   incriminate him personally.^[77] The only limitation on this rule is
   that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced
   those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him or her, but the
   jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of
   the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the
   corporation.

   As a condition of employment, workers may be required to answer their
   employer's narrowly defined questions regarding conduct on the job. If
   an employee invokes the Garrity rule (sometimes called the Garrity
   Warning or Garrity Rights) before answering the questions, then the
   answers cannot be used in criminal prosecution of the employee.^[78]
   This principle was developed in Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493
   (1967). The rule is most commonly applied to public employees such as
   police officers.

   In Boyd v. United States,^[79] the U.S. Supreme Court stated that "It
   is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the
   nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is
   pretended they will prove".

   On June 1, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in Berghuis v. Thompkins that
   the right was non-self-executing and a criminal suspect must
   specifically invoke the right against self-incrimination in order for
   constitutional protections to apply.^[80] The case centered around the
   interrogation of murder suspect Van Chester Thompkins, who remained
   virtually silent for hours, before giving a few brief responses to
   police questions. Most significantly, Thompkins answered "yes" when
   asked, "Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?"
   The statement was introduced at trial and Thompkins was convicted. In a
   5-4 ruling, the Court held that criminal suspects who do not clearly
   state their intention to remain silent are presumed to have waived
   their Fifth Amendment rights. Ironically, suspects must speak in order
   for their silence to be legally protected. The new rule will defer to
   police in cases where the suspect fails to unambiguously assert the
   right to remain silent.

Salinas v. Texas[edit]

   The Supreme Court extended the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in
   Salinas v. Texas in 2013, holding that a suspect's silence in response
   to a specific question posed during an interview with police when the
   suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily
   answering other questions during that interview could be used against
   him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment
   right to silence in response to the specific question.^[81] Of the five
   justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against
   him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy
   concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he
   did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas
   and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he
   had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment
   at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence in response to a
   question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to
   give self-incriminating testimony.^[82] The Court stated that there was
   no "ritualistic formula" necessary to assert this privilege, but that a
   person could not do so "by simply standing mute." If an individual
   fails to invoke his right, and is later charged with a crime, the
   prosecution may use his silence at trial as evidence of his guilt.^[83]

Due process[edit]

   Main article: Due Process Clause

Takings clause[edit]

Eminent domain[edit]

   Main article: Eminent domain

   The Supreme Court has held that the federal government and each state
   has the power of eminent domain—the power to take private property for
   "public use". The Takings Clause, the last clause of the Fifth
   Amendment, limits the power of eminent domain by requiring that "just
   compensation" be paid if private property is taken for public use. The
   just compensation provision of the Fifth Amendment did not originally
   apply directly to the states, but since Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co.
   v. Chicago (1897), federal courts have held that the Fourteenth
   Amendment extended the effects of that provision to the states. The
   federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the
   determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of
   the state legislatures, of what constitutes "public use". The property
   need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or
   disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public
   interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that
   the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated
   powers.

   The owner of the property that is taken by the government must be
   justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the
   government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes
   in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used.
   Normally, the fair market value of the property determines "just
   compensation". If the property is taken before the payment is made,
   interest accrues (though the courts have refrained from using the term
   "interest").

   The federal courts have not restrained state and local governments from
   seizing privately owned land for private commercial development on
   behalf of private developers. This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when
   the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Kelo v. City of New London.
   This 5–4 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by
   Justice Stevens, found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's
   decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that
   "the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes
   will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not
   limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue." Justice Kennedy's
   concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the
   development plan was not "of primary benefit to ... the developer" and
   that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In
   the dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued that this decision
   would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting
   that "Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private
   party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The
   beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate
   influence and power in the political process, including large
   corporations and development firms." She argued that the decision
   eliminates "any distinction between private and public use of
   property—and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use'
   from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment". A number of states, in
   response to Kelo, have passed laws and/or state constitutional
   amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize
   private land. Takings that are not "for public use" are not directly
   covered by the doctrine,^[84] however such a taking might violate due
   process rights under the Fourteenth amendment, or other applicable law.

   The exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of
   private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of
   government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under
   the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate
   innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or "taken" as a
   result of police action.^[85]

"Just compensation"[edit]

   The last two words of the amendment promise "just compensation" for
   takings by the government. In United States v. 50 Acres of Land (1984),
   the Supreme Court wrote that "The Court has repeatedly held that just
   compensation normally is to be measured by "the market value of the
   property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money."
   Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246 (1934) ... Deviation from this
   measure of just compensation has been required only "when market value
   has been too difficult to find, or when its application would result in
   manifest injustice to owner or public." United States v. Commodities
   Trading Corp., 339 U.S. 121, 123 (1950).

Equal liberty[edit]

   The Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment was relied upon by the
   Supreme Court in the 2013 case United States v. Windsor to overturn
   section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, a provision that defined
   marriage as being only the legal union of one man and one woman for
   purposes of various federal statutes and regulations.^[86]
