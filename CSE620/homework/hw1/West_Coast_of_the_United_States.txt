   West Coast or Pacific Coast are the terms for westernmost coastal
   states of the United States, usually California, Oregon, and
   Washington. More specifically, the term refers to an area defined on
   the east by the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Mojave Desert and on
   the west by the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Census groups the five states
   of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii together as the
   Pacific States division.^[1]

Population[edit]

   As of the 2010 Census, the estimated population of the Census Bureau's
   Pacific Region was approximately 47.8 million (56.9 million if Nevada
   and Arizona are included) – about 15.3% (18.2% with Nevada and Arizona)
   of US population.^[2] The largest city on the west coast of the United
   States is Los Angeles.

Major cities[edit]

   See also: California megapolitan areas

   Major cities and metropolitan areas on the West Coast include (from
   north to south):
     * Seattle metropolitan area:
          + Seattle
          + Bellevue
          + Tacoma

     * Portland metropolitan area:
          + Portland
          + Gresham
          + Vancouver
     * Sacramento and Greater Sacramento
     * San Francisco Bay Area:
          + San Francisco
          + Oakland
          + San Jose
     * Stockton
     * Fresno
     * Bakersfield
     * Inland Empire
          + San Bernardino
          + Riverside
     * Los Angeles Metropolitan Area:
          + Los Angeles
          + Long Beach
     * San Diego

   However, of these aforementioned cities and metropolitan areas, only
   Los Angeles/Long Beach, San Francisco and San Diego are directly on the
   Pacific Ocean.

History[edit]

   and Native Americans in the United States

   The history of the West Coast begins with the arrival of the earliest
   known humans of the Americas, Paleo-Indians, crossing the Bering Strait
   from Eurasia into North America over a land bridge, Beringia, that
   existed between 45,000 BCE and 12,000 BCE (47,000–14,000 years ago).
   Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of
   large herbivores far into Alaska. Between 16,500 BCE and 13,500 BCE
   (18,500–15,500 years ago), ice-free corridors developed along the
   Pacific coast and valleys of North America and possibly by sea.^[3]

   Alaska Natives, indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and
   California indigenous peoples eventually descended from the
   Paleo-Indians. They developed various languages and established trade
   routes.^[citation needed]

   Later, Spanish, British, Mexican, Russian, and American explorers and
   settlers began colonizing the area.^[citation needed]

Climate[edit]

   The West Coast of the United States has an oceanic climate in its
   Northern edge towards the Canadian border, but from the Californian
   border towards the Mexican border the climate is mediterranean. The
   coastline sees significantly mild temperatures when compared to the
   inland areas, with differences of 19 °C between Eureka's and Redding's
   July temperatures, in spite of less than 100 miles separating the
   locations. Similar fluctuations can be seen all through the coastline,
   and could partially be explained by the cold currents in the Pacific
   ocean moderating coastal temperatures. In fact, the northern half of
   the Californian coast has the coldest low-elevation summer daytime high
   temperatures for the 37th to 40th parallel in the Northern hemisphere,
   normally associated with humid subtropical climate or humid continental
   climate with hot summers and cold winters. This is not just occurring
   in the San Francisco Bay Area but also affecting Santa Monica in Los
   Angeles, Southern California, with very little yearly temperature
   differences but with cool summers similar to those expected in Northern
   Europe. A short journey inland and summer temperatures are compatible
   with the rest of the United States on the same parallels, sometimes
   warmer due to prevailing winds from the Nevada and Arizona hot desert
   climate.

Culture[edit]

   Since the West Coast has only been populated by immigrants recently,
   compared with the East Coast, its culture is considerably younger.
   Additionally, its demographic composition underlies its cultural
   difference from the rest of the United States. California's history
   first as a major Spanish colony, and later Mexican territory, has given
   the lower West Coast a distinctive Hispanic tone, which it also shares
   with the Southwest. Similarly, two of the three cities in which Asian
   Americans have concentrated, San Francisco and Los Angeles,^[4]^[5]^[6]
   are located on the West Coast, with significant populations in other
   West Coast cities. San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest in North
   America, is a vibrant cultural center.

   Compared to the East Coast, the West has generally been considered less
   bounded by tradition and more freely engaged and open to new ideas.^[7]
   The West Coast also has a proportionally larger share of green cities
   within the United States, which manifests itself in different cultural
   practices such as bicycling and organic gardening.^[8]
