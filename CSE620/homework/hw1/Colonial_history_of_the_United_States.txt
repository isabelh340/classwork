   The colonial history of the United States covers the history of
   European settlements from the start of colonization of America until
   their incorporation into the United States. In the late 16th century,
   England, France, Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization
   programs in eastern North America.^[1] Small early attempts—such as the
   English Lost Colony of Roanoke—often disappeared; everywhere the death
   rate of the first arrivals was very high. Nevertheless successful
   colonies were established. European settlers came from a variety of
   social and religious groups. No aristocrats settled permanently, but a
   number of adventurers, soldiers, farmers, and tradesmen arrived.
   Diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of New
   Netherland, the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden, the English Quakers of
   Pennsylvania, the English Puritans of New England, the English settlers
   of Jamestown, and the "worthy poor" of Georgia, came to the new
   continent and built colonies with distinctive social, religious,
   political and economic styles. Non-British colonies were taken over and
   the inhabitants were all assimilated, unlike in Nova Scotia, where the
   British expelled the French Acadian inhabitants. There were no major
   civil wars among the 13 colonies, and the two chief armed rebellions
   (in Virginia in 1676 and in New York in 1689–91) were short-lived
   failures. Wars between the French and the British—the French and Indian
   Wars and Father Rale's War—were recurrent, and involved French support
   for Wabanaki Confederacy attacks on the frontiers. By 1760 France was
   defeated and the British seized its colonies.

   The four distinct regions were: New England, the Middle Colonies, the
   Chesapeake Bay Colonies (Upper South) and the Lower South. Some
   historians add a fifth region, the Frontier, which was never separately
   organized.^[1] By the time European settlers arrived around 1600–1650,
   the majority of the Native Americans living in the eastern United
   States had been ravaged by new diseases, introduced to them decades
   before by explorers and sailors.^[2]

Goals of colonization[edit]

   Colonizers came from European kingdoms with highly developed military,
   naval, governmental and entrepreneurial capabilities. The Spanish and
   Portuguese centuries-old experience of conquest and colonization during
   the Reconquista, coupled with new oceanic ship navigation skills,
   provided the tools, ability, and desire to colonize the New World.
   England, France and the Netherlands started colonies in both the West
   Indies and North America. They had the ability to build ocean-worthy
   ships, but did not have as strong a history of colonization in foreign
   lands as did Portugal and Spain. However, English entrepreneurs gave
   their colonies a base of merchant-based investment that needed much
   less government support.^[3]

Mercantilism[edit]

   Mercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies
   from the 1660s. Mercantilism meant that the government and merchants
   based in England became partners with the goal of increasing political
   power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires and even
   merchants based in its own colonies. The government protected its
   London-based merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers,
   regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize
   exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to
   fight smuggling, especially by American merchants, some of whose
   activities (which included direct trade with the French, Spanish,
   Dutch, and Portuguese) were classified as such by the Navigation Acts.
   The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and
   silver would pour into London. The government took its share through
   duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The
   government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not
   only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the
   other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy
   captured New Amsterdam (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive
   markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother
   country.^[4]

Religious persecution[edit]

   The prospect of religious persecution by authorities of the crown and
   the Church of England prompted a significant number of colonization
   efforts. People fleeing persecution by King Charles I were responsible
   for settling most of New England, and the Province of Maryland was
   founded in part to be a haven for Roman Catholics.

Early colonial failures[edit]

   Anonymous Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to map the
   future eastern seaboard of the U.S. from New York to Florida, as
   documented in the Cantino planisphere of 1502. However, they kept their
   discoveries a secret and did not attempt to settle in North America, as
   the Inter caetera issued by Pope Alexander VI in 1493 had granted these
   lands to Spain.

   Other countries did attempt to found colonies in what later became the
   United States over the following century, and most of these attempts
   ended in failure. The colonists faced high rates of death due to many
   reasons, including disease, starvation, inefficient resupply, conflict
   with Native Americans, and attacks by rival European powers.

   Spain had numerous failed attempts, including San Miguel de Gualdape in
   Georgia (1526), Pánfilo de Narváez's expedition to Florida's Gulf coast
   (1528–36), Pensacola in West Florida (1559–61), Fort San Juan in North
   Carolina (1567–68), and the Ajacán Mission in Virginia (1570–71).^[1]

   The French failed at Parris Island, South Carolina (1562–63), Fort
   Caroline on Florida's Atlantic coast (1564–65), Saint Croix Island,
   Maine (1604-05),^[1] and Fort Saint Louis, Texas (1685–89).

   The most notable English failures were the "Lost Colony of Roanoke"
   (1587–90) in North Carolina and Popham Colony in Maine (1607–08). It
   was at the Roanoke Colony that Virginia Dare became the first English
   child born in the Americas; her fate is unknown.

Spanish colonies[edit]

   At one time, Spain claimed and controlled North America west of the
   Mississippi and south of the Canadian border. Additionally, east of the
   Mississippi River, Spain claimed what is now the state of Florida and
   parts of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Florida[edit]

   Main articles: History of Florida and Spanish Florida

   Spain established several small outposts in Florida in the early 16th
   century. The most important of these, St. Augustine, was founded in
   1565 as a garrison town to help protect gold-laden galleons sailing
   north on the Gulf Stream from New Spain (Spanish Mexico) back to Spain.
   The outpost was repeatedly attacked and burned by pirates, privateers,
   and English forces, but it survived, and is the oldest permanent
   European settlement in what is now the continental United States. The
   British and nearby British colonies attacked Spanish Florida on
   numerous occasions. The colony of South Carolina launched large scale
   raiding expeditions in the early 18th century that effectively
   destroyed the Spanish mission system. James Oglethorpe led a large
   invasion force of colonials and British regulars from colonial Georgia
   and laid siege to St. Augustine in 1740, but the fort held, and both
   St. Augustine and Pensacola remained under Spanish control. However,
   English-allied Indians such as the Yamasee continuously conducted slave
   raids throughout northern Florida, killing or enslaving most of the
   region's natives.^[1]

   In 1763, Spain traded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for control
   of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the
   Seven Years' War. Florida was home to about 3,000 Spaniards at the
   time, and nearly all quickly left. Britain occupied Florida, but did
   not send many settlers to the area, and control was restored to Spain
   in 1783 by the Peace of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary
   War. Spain sent no more settlers or missionaries to Florida during this
   second colonial period. The inhabitants of West Florida revolted
   against the Spanish in 1810 and formed the Republic of West Florida,
   which was quickly annexed by the United States. The United States took
   possession of the remainder, East Florida, in 1821 according to the
   terms of the Adams-Onís Treaty.^[5]^[6]

New Mexico[edit]

   Main article: History of New Mexico

   Throughout the 16th century, Spain explored the southwest from Mexico
   with the most notable explorer being Francisco Coronado whose
   expedition rode throughout modern New Mexico and Arizona. The Spanish,
   moving north from Mexico, settled villages in the upper valley of the
   Rio Grande, including much of the western half of the present-day state
   of New Mexico. The capital was Santa Fe. Local Indians expelled the
   Spanish for 12 years following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680; they returned
   in 1692 in the "bloodless" reoccupation of Santa Fe.^[7] Control was by
   Spain (223 years) and Mexico (25 years) until 1846, when the American
   Army of the West took over in the Mexican-American War. About of a
   third of the population in the 21st century descends from the Spanish
   settlers.^[1]^[8]

California[edit]

   Spanish explorers sailed along the coast of present day California from
   the early 16th century to the mid-18th century, but no settlements were
   established over those centuries.

   Spain, from 1769 until the independence of Mexico in 1820, sent
   missionaries and soldiers to Alta California who created a series of
   missions operated by Franciscan priests. They also operated presidios
   (forts), pueblos (settlements)s, and ranchos (land grant ranches),
   along the southern and central coast of California. Father Junípero
   Serra, founded the first missions in Spanish upper Las Californias,
   starting with Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769. Through the Spanish
   and Mexican eras they eventually comprised a series of 21 missions to
   spread Christianity among the local Native Americans, linked by El
   Camino Real ("The Royal Road"). They were established to convert the
   indigenous peoples of California, while protecting historic Spanish
   claims to the area. The missions introduced European technology,
   livestock, and crops. The Indian Reductions converted the native
   peoples into groups of Mission Indians; they worked as laborers in the
   missions and the ranchos. In the 1830s the missions were disbanded and
   the lands sold to Californios. The indigenous Native American
   population was around 150,000; the Californios (Mexican era
   Californians) around 10,000; with the rest immigrant Americans and
   other nationalities involved in trade and business in California.^[9]

Texas[edit]

New France[edit]

   Main articles: New France and French colonization of the Americas
   The 1750 possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain
   (orange) in contrast to the borders of contemporary Canada and the
   United States.

   New France was the vast area explored and claimed by France. It was
   composed of several colonies. They were Acadia, Canada, Newfoundland,
   Louisiana, Île-Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island), and Île Saint
   Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). Although all of these
   territories would come under British control in the 18th century, only
   portions of Canada, Acadia and Louisiana became parts of the United
   States.

Pays d'en Haut[edit]

   By 1660, French fur trappers based in Montreal pushed west along the
   Great Lakes and founded Green Bay, Saint Ignace, Sault Sainte Marie,
   Vincennes, and Detroit in 1701. By 1773, the population of Detroit was
   1,400.^[10] At the end of the War for Independence in 1783, the region
   south of the Great Lakes formally became part of the United States.

Illinois Country[edit]

   The Illinois country by 1752 had a population of 2,500; it was
   concentrated around Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Sainte Genevieve. According
   to one scholar, "The Illinois Habitant was a gay soul; he seemed
   shockingly carefree to later, self-righteous Puritans from the American
   colonies."^[11]

Louisiana[edit]

   French Louisiana, first settled at Mobile in 1702, started its growth
   when 7,000 French immigrants arrived in New Orleans in 1718. There was
   little economic development because the city lacked a large
   hinterland.^[12] The areas around New Orleans and west of the
   Mississippi were given to Spain in 1769. Louisiana was taken back by
   France and sold to the United States in 1803 in the Louisiana
   Purchase.^[13]

   A map of New Amsterdam in 1660

   Nieuw-Nederland, or New Netherland, chartered in 1614, was a colonial
   province of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands in what became
   New York State and parts of neighboring states.^[14] The peak
   population was less than 10,000. The Dutch established a patroon system
   with feudal-like rights given to a few powerful landholders; they also
   established religious tolerance and free trade. The colony's capital,
   New Amsterdam, founded in 1625 and located at the southern tip of the
   island of Manhattan, would grow to become a major world city. The city
   was captured by the English in 1664; they took complete control of the
   colony in 1674 and renamed it New York. However the Dutch landholdings
   remained, and the Hudson River Valley maintained a traditional Dutch
   character until the 1820s.^[15]^[16] Traces of Dutch influence, such as
   homes, family surnames, and the names of roads and whole towns remain
   in present-day northern New Jersey and southeastern New York State.

New Sweden[edit]

   Main articles: New Sweden and Swedish colonization of the Americas
   Map of New Sweden by Amandus Johnson

   New Sweden (Swedish: Nya Sverige) was a Swedish colony along the
   Delaware River Valley from 1638 to 1655. The few hundred settlers
   huddled around Fort Christina. It was captured by the Dutch in 1655 and
   merged into New Netherland, and most traces of Swedish culture faded
   away.^[17]

Russian colonies[edit]

   Main articles: Russian America and Russian colonization of the Americas

   Russia explored the area that became Alaska starting with the Second
   Kamchatka expedition in the 1730s and early 1740s. Their first
   settlement was founded in 1784 by Grigory Shelikhov.^[18] The
   Russian-American Company was formed in 1799 with the influence of
   Nikolay Rezanov for the purpose of buying sea otters for their fur from
   native hunters. In 1867 the U.S. purchased Alaska and nearly all
   Russians abandoned the area except a few missionaries of the Russian
   Orthodox Church working among the natives.^[19]

English colonies[edit]

   The 1606 grants by James I to the London and Plymouth companies. The
   overlapping area (yellow) was granted to both companies on the
   stipulation that neither found a settlement within 100 miles (160 km)
   of each other. The location of the Jamestown Settlement is shown by "J"

   England made its first successful efforts at the start of the 17th
   century for several reasons. During this era, English proto-nationalism
   and national assertiveness blossomed under the threat of Spanish
   invasion, assisted by a degree of Protestant militarism and the energy
   of Queen Elizabeth. At this time, however, there was no official
   attempt by the English government to create a colonial empire. Rather,
   the motivation behind the founding of colonies was piecemeal and
   variable. Practical considerations, such as commercial enterprise,
   overpopulation and the desire for freedom of religion, played their
   parts. The main waves of settlement came in the 17th century. After
   1700 most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured
   servants—young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much
   richer environment.^[20] Between the late 1610s and the American
   Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to its
   American colonies.^[21] The first convicts to arrive pre-dated the
   arrival of the Mayflower.

Chesapeake Bay area[edit]

   Main articles: Jamestown, Virginia, Colony of Virginia and Province of
   Maryland

Virginia[edit]

   The first successful English colony was Jamestown, established May 14,
   1607 near Chesapeake Bay. The business venture was financed and
   coordinated by the London Virginia Company, a joint stock company
   looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very
   high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians,
   and little gold. The colony survived and flourished by turning to
   tobacco as a cash crop. By the late 17th century, Virginia's export
   economy was largely based on tobacco, and new, richer settlers came in
   to take up large portions of land, build large plantations and import
   indentured servants and slaves. In 1676, Bacon's Rebellion occurred,
   but was suppressed by royal officials. After Bacon's Rebellion, African
   slaves rapidly replaced indentured servants as Virginia's main labor
   force.^[22]^[23]

   The colonial assembly shared power with a royally appointed governor.
   On a more local level, governmental power was invested in county
   courts, which were self-perpetuating (the incumbents filled any
   vacancies and there never were popular elections). As cash crop
   producers, Chesapeake plantations were heavily dependent on trade with
   England. With easy navigation by river, there were few towns and no
   cities; planters shipped directly to Britain. High death rates and a
   very young population profile characterized the colony during its first
   years.^[23]

Puritans[edit]

   Main article: Puritan

   The Puritans, a much larger group than the Pilgrims, established the
   Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to
   reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New
   World. By 1640, 20,000 had arrived; many died soon after arrival, but
   the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The
   Massachusetts settlement spawned other Puritan colonies in New England,
   including the New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies. During the
   17th century the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by
   Connecticut.

   The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and
   politically innovative culture that still influences the modern United
   States.^[24] They hoped this new land would serve as a "redeemer
   nation". They fled England and in America attempted to create a "nation
   of saints" or a "City upon a Hill": an intensely religious, thoroughly
   righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe. Roger
   Williams, who preached religious toleration, separation of Church and
   State, and a complete break with the Church of England, was banished
   and founded Rhode Island Colony, which became a haven for other
   refugees from the Puritan community, such as Anne Hutchinson.^[25]

   Economically, Puritan New England fulfilled the expectations of its
   founders. Unlike the cash crop-oriented plantations of the Chesapeake
   region, the Puritan economy was based on the efforts of self-supporting
   farmsteads who traded only for goods they could not produce
   themselves.^[26] There was a generally higher economic standing and
   standard of living in New England than in the Chesapeake. Along with
   agriculture, fishing, and logging, New England became an important
   mercantile and shipbuilding center, serving as the hub for trading
   between the southern colonies and Europe.^[27]

Other New England[edit]

   The Pilgrims were a small Protestant sect based in England and the
   Netherlands. One group sailed on the Mayflower and settled in Plymouth,
   Massachusetts in 1620. After drawing up the Mayflower Compact by which
   they gave themselves broad powers of self-governance, they established
   the small Plymouth Colony. William Bradford was their main leader.
   Providence Plantation was founded in 1636 by Rev. Roger Williams on
   land provided by the Narragansett sachem, Canonicus. Williams, fleeing
   from religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, agreed with
   his fellow settlers on an egalitarian constitution providing for
   majority rule "in civil things" and "liberty of conscience".^[22]

   Other colonists who disagreed with Puritans in Massachusetts settled to
   the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to
   establish more religiously diverse colonies in New Hampshire and Maine.
   These small settlements were absorbed by Massachusetts when it made
   significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was
   eventually given a separate charter in 1679. (Maine remained a part of
   Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.)

Dominion of New England[edit]

   Under King James II of England, the New England colonies (as well as
   New York and the Jerseys) were briefly united as the Dominion of New
   England (1686–89). The administration eventually led by Governor Sir
   Edmund Andros seized colonial charters, revoked land titles, and ruled
   without local assemblies, causing anger among the population. The 1689
   Boston revolt, inspired by England's Glorious Revolution against James
   II, caused Andros, Boston Anglicans, and senior dominion officials to
   be arrested by the Massachusetts militia. Andros was jailed for several
   months, then returned to England. The Dominion of New England was
   dissolved and governments resumed under their earlier charters.^[28]
   However, the Massachusetts charter had been revoked in 1684, and a new
   one was issued in 1691 that combined Massachusetts and Plymouth into
   the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Although King William III sought at
   least to unite the New England colonies militarily (for example, by
   appointing the Earl of Bellomont to three simultaneous governorships,
   and military command over Connecticut and Rhode Island), these attempts
   at unified control failed.

Middle Colonies[edit]

   Main article: Middle Colonies

   The Middle Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of New York,
   New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, were characterized by a large
   degree of diversity—religious, political, economic, and ethnic. The
   Dutch colony of New Netherland was taken over by the British and
   renamed New York but large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony. New
   Jersey began as a division of New York, and was for a time divided into
   the proprietary colonies of East and West Jersey. Many German and Irish
   immigrants settled in these areas, as well as in Connecticut. A large
   portion of the settlers who came to Pennsylvania were German.^[27]
   Philadelphia became the center of the colonies; by the end of the
   colonial period 30,000 people lived there, having come from diverse
   nations and practicing numerous trades.

   Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of the Quaker
   William Penn. It came to include the territory of Delaware, which had
   once been part of New Netherland; Delaware had a government independent
   of that established in Philadelphia, but was never a separate colony.

Lower South[edit]

   The colonial South included the plantation colonies of the Chesapeake
   region (Virginia, Maryland, and, by some classifications, Delaware) and
   the lower South (Carolina, which eventually split into North and South
   Carolina; and Georgia).^[27]

Carolinas[edit]

   Main articles: History of South Carolina, History of North Carolina,
   Province of Carolina, Province of North Carolina and Province of South
   Carolina

   The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the
   Province of Carolina. It was a private venture, financed by a group of
   English Lords Proprietors, who obtained a Royal Charter to the
   Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become
   profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and
   even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for
   emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their
   remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area, a
   mission led by Sir John Colleton. The expedition located fertile and
   defensible ground at what was to become Charleston (originally Charles
   Town for Charles II of England), thus beginning the English
   colonization of the mainland. The original settlers in South Carolina
   established a lucrative trade in provisions, deerskins and Indian
   captives with the Caribbean islands. The settlers came mainly from the
   English colony of Barbados and brought African slaves with them.
   Barbados, as a wealthy sugarcane plantation island, was one of the
   early English colonies to use large numbers of Africans in plantation
   style agriculture. The cultivation of rice was introduced during the
   1690s via Africans from the rice-growing regions of Africa. North
   Carolina remained a frontier throughout the early colonial period.^[27]

   At first, South Carolina was politically divided. Its ethnic makeup
   included the original settlers, a group of rich, slave-owning English
   settlers from the island of Barbados; and Huguenots, a French-speaking
   community of Protestants. Nearly continuous frontier warfare during the
   era of King William's War and Queen Anne's War drove economic and
   political wedges between merchants and planters. The disaster of the
   1715 Yamasee War, which threatened the colony's viability, set off a
   decade of political turmoil. By 1729, the proprietary government had
   collapsed, and the Proprietors sold both colonies back to the British
   crown.^[27]

Georgia[edit]

   Main article: Province of Georgia
   Savannah, Georgia Colony, early 18th century

   James Oglethorpe, an 18th-century British Member of Parliament,
   established the Georgia Colony in 1733 as a common solution to two
   problems. At that time, tension between Spain and Great Britain was
   high, and the British feared that Spanish Florida was threatening the
   British Carolinas. Oglethorpe decided to establish a colony in the
   contested border region of Georgia and populate it with debtors who
   would otherwise have been imprisoned according to standard British
   practice. This plan would both rid Great Britain of its undesirable
   elements and provide her with a base from which to attack Florida. The
   first colonists arrived in 1733.^[27]

   Georgia was established on strict moralistic principles. Slavery was
   forbidden, as were alcohol and other forms of supposed immorality.
   However, the reality of the colony was far from ideal. The colonists
   were unhappy about the puritanical lifestyle and complained that their
   colony could not compete economically with the Carolina rice
   plantations. Georgia initially failed to prosper, but eventually the
   restrictions were lifted, slavery was allowed, and it became as
   prosperous as the Carolinas. The colony of Georgia never had a specific
   religion. It consisted of people of various faiths.

East and West Florida[edit]

   Main articles: East Florida and West Florida

   In 1763, Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain, which established the
   colonies of East and West Florida. The Floridas remained loyal to Great
   Britain during the American Revolution. They were returned to Spain in
   1783 (in exchange for the Bahamas), at which time most of the British
   left. The Spanish then neglected the Floridas: few Spaniards lived
   there when the US bought the area in 1819.^[1]

British colonial government[edit]

   Each colony had a paid colonial agent in London to represent its
   interests.

   The three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial (royal
   colony), proprietary, and charter. These governments were all
   subordinate to the king in London, with no explicit relationship with
   the British Parliament. Beginning late in the 17th century, the
   administration of all British colonies was overseen by the Board of
   Trade in London.

Provincial colonies[edit]

   New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
   Georgia, and eventually Massachusetts, were provincial, also called
   royal colonies.

   The provincial government was governed by commissions created at
   pleasure by the monarch. A governor (and in some provinces his council)
   were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general
   executive powers, and authorized to call a locally elected assembly.
   The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly
   was in session in addition to its role in advising the governor.
   Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders
   and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power
   of absolute veto, and could prorogue (i.e., delay) and dissolve the
   assembly.

   The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring
   that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England. In practice
   this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies
   sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and
   crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of
   Trade, which also held veto power of legislation.

Proprietary colonies[edit]

   Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were
   proprietary colonies. They were governed much as royal colonies except
   that lord proprietors, rather than the king, appointed the governor.
   They were set up after the Restoration of 1660 and typically enjoyed
   greater civil and religious liberty.^[29]

Charter colonies[edit]

   Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantation, and Connecticut
   were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684,
   and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.

   Charter governments were political corporations created by letters
   patent, giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of
   legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental
   constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and
   judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials.^[30]

Political culture[edit]

   As Bonomi (1971) shows, the most distinctive feature of colonial
   society was the vibrant political culture, which attracted the most
   talented and ambitious young men into politics.^[31] First, suffrage
   was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a
   certain amount of property allowed to vote.^[32] While fewer than 1% of
   British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible.
   The roots of democracy were present,^[33] although deference was
   typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.^[34]

   Second, in the colonies a very wide range of public and private
   business was decided by elected bodies, especially the assemblies and
   county governments in each colony.^[35] They handled land grants,
   commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor
   relief, taverns, and schools.^[36] Americans sued each other at a very
   high rate, with binding decisions made not by a great lord but by local
   judges and juries. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal
   profession, so that the intense involvement of lawyers in politics
   became an American characteristic by the 1770s.^[37]

   Thirdly, the American colonies were exceptional in the world because of
   the representation of many different interest groups in political
   decision-making. Unlike Europe, where aristocratic families and the
   established church were in control, the American political culture was
   open to economic, social, religious, ethnic and geographical interests,
   with merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans,
   Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, and
   many other identifiable groups taking part. Elected representatives
   learned to listen to these interests because 90% of the men in the
   lower houses lived in their districts, unlike England where it was
   common to have an absentee member of Parliament.^[38]

   Finally, and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and
   increasingly adopted the political values of Republicanism, which
   stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of
   corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.^[39]^[40] Republicanism provided
   the framework for colonial resistance to British schemes of taxation
   after 1763, which escalated into the Revolution.

   None of the colonies had stable political parties of the sort that
   formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for
   power, especially in the perennial battles between the appointed
   governor and the elected assembly.^[41] There were often "country" and
   "court" factions, representing those opposed to and in favor of,
   respectively, of the governor's actions and agenda. Massachusetts,
   which from its 1691 charter had particularly low requirements for
   voting eligibility and strong rural representation in its assembly,
   also had a strong populist faction that represented the province's
   lower classes.

   Up and down the colonies non-English ethnic groups had clusters of
   settlements. The most numerous were the Scotch Irish^[42] and the
   Germans.^[43] Each group assimilated into the dominant English,
   Protestant commercial and political culture, albeit with local
   variations. They tended to vote in blocs and politicians negotiated
   with group leaders for votes. They generally retained their historic
   languages and cultural traditions, even as they merged into the
   emerging American culture.^[44]

   Ethnocultural factors were most visible in Pennsylvania. During
   1756–76, the Quakers were the largest faction in the legislature, but
   they were losing their dominance to the emerging Presbyterian faction
   based on Scotch-Irish votes, supported by Germans.^[45]

Unification of the British colonies[edit]

Colonial Wars: A common defense[edit]

   Main article: Colonial American military history

   Efforts at common defense of the colonies (principally against shared
   threats from Indians, the French, and the Dutch) began as early as the
   1640s, when the Puritan colonies of New England formed a confederation
   to coordinate military and judicial matters. From the 1670s several
   royal governors, notably Sir Edmund Andros (who at various times
   governed New York, New England, and Virginia) and Francis Nicholson
   (governed Maryland, Virginia, Nova Scotia, and Carolina) proposed or
   attempted to implement means to coordinate defensive and offensive
   military matters. After King Phillips War, Andros successfully
   negotiated the Covenant Chain, a series of Indian treaties that brought
   relative calm to the frontiers of the middle colonies for many years.

   The northern colonies (particularly present-day Maine and New
   Hampshire) experienced numerous assaults from the Wabanaki Confederacy
   and the French from Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars as
   well as Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War.
   Siege of Louisbourg (1745) by Peter Monamy

   One event that reminded colonists of their shared identity as British
   subjects was the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) in Europe.
   This conflict spilled over into the colonies, where it was known as
   "King George's War". The major battles took place in Europe, but
   American colonial troops fought the French and their Indian allies in
   New York, New England, and Nova Scotia with the Siege of Louisbourg
   (1745).

   At the Albany Congress of 1754, Benjamin Franklin proposed that the
   colonies be united by a Grand Council overseeing a common policy for
   defense, expansion, and Indian affairs. While the plan was thwarted by
   colonial legislatures and King George II, it was an early indication
   that the British colonies of North America were headed towards
   unification.^[46]

French and Indian War[edit]

   Main article: French and Indian War

   Benjamin Franklin's political cartoon calling for colonial unity during
   the French and Indian War; it would be used again during the American
   Revolution.

   The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the American extension of the
   general European conflict known as the Seven Years' War. Although
   previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then
   spread to the colonies, the French and Indian War is notable for having
   started in North America and then having spread to Europe. Increasing
   competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes
   and Ohio valley, was one of the primary origins of the war.^[47]

   The French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British
   North American colonists when William Pitt the Elder decided that, in
   order to win the war against France, major military resources needed to
   be devoted to North America. For the first time, the continent became
   one of the main theaters of what could be termed a "world war". During
   the war, the position of the British colonies as part of the British
   Empire was made truly apparent, as British military and civilian
   officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans. The
   war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused
   men, who might normally have never left their own colony, to travel
   across the continent, fighting alongside men from decidedly different,
   yet still "American", backgrounds. Throughout the course of the war,
   British officers trained American ones (most notably George Washington)
   for battle—which would later benefit the American Revolution. Also,
   colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively, for
   the first time, in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.^[47]
   The relations between the British military establishment and the
   colonists were not always positive, setting the stage for later
   distrust and dislike of British troops.
   Territorial changes following the French and Indian War: land held by
   the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763
   is shown in pink.

   In the Treaty of Paris (1763), France formally ceded the eastern part
   of its vast North American empire to Britain (having secretly given the
   territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain the
   previous year). Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American
   colonies, most of present-day Nova Scotia, and most of the Hudson Bay
   watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east
   of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the
   Ohio River valley. Britain also gained Spanish Florida, from which it
   formed the colonies of East and West Florida. In removing a major
   foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed
   the colonists' need of colonial protection.

   The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The
   colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before.
   However, disunity was beginning to form. British Prime Minister William
   Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use
   of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was
   a successful wartime strategy, but after the war was over, each side
   believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British
   elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily
   that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists
   replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served
   European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the
   chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.^[47]

Ties to the British Empire[edit]

   Although the colonies were very different from one another, they were
   still a part of the British Empire in more than just name.

   Socially, the colonial elite of Boston, New York, Charleston, and
   Philadelphia saw their identity as British. Although many had never
   been to Britain, they imitated British styles of dress, dance, and
   etiquette. This social upper echelon built its mansions in the Georgian
   style, copied the furniture designs of Thomas Chippendale, and
   participated in the intellectual currents of Europe, such as the
   Enlightenment. To many of their inhabitants, the seaport cities of
   colonial America were truly British cities.^[48]

Republicanism[edit]

   Many of the political structures of the colonies drew upon the
   republicanism expressed by opposition leaders in Britain, most notably
   the Commonwealth men and the Whig traditions. Many Americans at the
   time saw the colonies' systems of governance as modeled after the
   British constitution of the time, with the king corresponding to the
   governor, the House of Commons to the colonial assembly, and the House
   of Lords to the governor's council. The codes of law of the colonies
   were often drawn directly from English law; indeed, English common law
   survives not only in Canada, but also throughout the United States.
   Eventually, it was a dispute over the meaning of some of these
   political ideals, especially political representation, and
   republicanism that led to the American Revolution.^[49]

Consumption[edit]

   Another point on which the colonies found themselves more similar than
   different was the booming import of British goods. The British economy
   had begun to grow rapidly at the end of the 17th century, and by the
   mid-18th century, small factories in Britain were producing much more
   than the nation could consume. Finding a market for their goods in the
   British colonies of North America, Britain increased her exports to
   that region by 360% between 1740 and 1770. Because British merchants
   offered generous credit to their customers,^[citation needed] Americans
   began buying staggering amounts of British goods. From Nova Scotia to
   Georgia, all British subjects bought similar products, creating and
   anglicizing a sort of common identity.^[48]

Atlantic world[edit]

   In recent years historians have enlarged their perspective to cover the
   entire Atlantic world in a subfield now known as Atlantic
   history.^[50]^[51] Of special interest are such themes as international
   migration, trade, colonization, comparative military and governmental
   institutions, the transmission of religions and missionary work, and
   the slave trade. It was the Age of the Enlightenment, and ideas flowed
   back and forth across the Atlantic, with Philadelphian Benjamin
   Franklin playing a major role. Warfare was critical, for as
   Furstenberg, (2008) explains, from 1754 to 1815, the major imperial
   players – Britain, the American colonies, Spain, France, the First
   Nations (Indians) and the United States fought a series of conflicts
   that can be called a "Long War for the West" over control of the
   region.^[52]

   Women played a role in the emergence of the capitalist economy in the
   Atlantic world. The types of local commercial exchange in which they
   participated independently – especially markets in dairy and produce
   commodities – were well integrated with the trade networks between
   colonial merchants throughout the Atlantic region. For example, local
   women merchants were important suppliers of foodstuffs to transatlantic
   shipping concerns.^[53]

Tax protests lead to Revolution[edit]

   Main article: American Revolution

   In the colonial era, Americans insisted on their rights as Englishmen
   to have their own legislature raise all taxes. Tax loads in practice
   were very light, and far lower than in England. Beginning in 1765 the
   British Parliament asserted its supreme authority to lay taxes, and a
   series of American protests began that led directly to the American
   Revolution. The first wave of protests attacked the Stamp Act of 1765,
   and marked the first time Americans from each of the 13 colonies met
   together and planned a common front against illegal taxes. The Boston
   Tea Party of 1773 dumped British tea into Boston Harbor because it
   contained a hidden tax Americans refused to pay. The British responded
   by trying to crush traditional liberties in Massachusetts, leading to
   the American revolution starting in 1775.^[54]

   The idea of independence steadily became more widespread, after being
   first proposed and advocated by a number of public figures and
   commentators throughout the Colonies. One of the most prominent voices
   on behalf of independence was Thomas Paine, in his pamphlet Common
   Sense published in 1776. Another group which called for independence
   was the Sons of Liberty, which had been founded in 1765 in Boston by
   Samuel Adams and which was now becoming even more strident and
   numerous.

   The Parliament attempted a series of taxes and punishments which met
   more and more resistance: First Quartering Act (1765); Declaratory Act
   (1766); Townshend Revenue Act (1767); and Tea Act (1773). In response
   to the Boston Tea Party Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts: Second
   Quartering Act (1774); Quebec Act (1774); Massachusetts Government Act
   (1774); Administration of Justice Act (1774); Boston Port Act (1774);
   Prohibitory Act (1775). By this point the 13 colonies had organized
   themselves into the Continental Congress and began setting up shadow
   governments and drilling their militia in preparation for war.^[55]

Colonial life[edit]

Religion[edit]

   The religious ties between the metropole and the colonies was
   especially strong. The Puritans of New England seldom kept in touch
   with nonconformists in England. Much closer were the transatlantic
   relationships maintained by the Quakers. (see History of the Religious
   Society of Friends). Likewise the Methodists kept in close
   touch.^[56]^[57]

   The Anglican Church was officially established in the Southern
   colonies, which meant that local taxes paid the salary of the minister,
   the parish had civic responsibilities such as poor relief, and the
   local gentry controlled the parish. see Religion in early Virginia. The
   church was disestablished during the American Revolution. The Anglicans
   in America were controlled by the Bishop of London, and there was a
   long debate over whether to establish an Anglican bishop in America.
   The other Protestants strongly opposed it.^[58]

Women's roles[edit]

   See also: Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies

   The experiences of women during the colonial era varied greatly from
   colony to colony. In New England, the Puritan settlers brought their
   strong religious values with them to the New World, which dictated that
   a woman be subordinate to her husband and dedicate herself to rearing
   God-fearing children to the best of her ability. Hispanic women were at
   the center of family life in New Mexico and California.

   There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan
   settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with
   their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many
   women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted
   women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local
   English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives
   owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability
   to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.
   Much later on in the colonial experience, as the values of the American
   Enlightenment were imported from Britain, the philosophies of such
   thinkers as John Locke weakened the view that husbands were natural
   "rulers" over their wives and replacing it with a (slightly) more
   liberal conception of marriage. Women also lost most control of their
   property when marrying. Even single women could not sue anyone or be
   sued, or make contracts, and divorce was almost impossible until the
   late eighteenth century.^[59]

New England[edit]

   In New England, the Puritans created self-governing communities of
   religious congregations of farmers, or yeomen, and their families.
   High-level politicians gave out plots of land to male settlers, or
   proprietors, who then divided the land amongst themselves. Large
   portions were usually given to men of higher social standing, but every
   white man—who wasn't indentured or criminally bonded—had enough land to
   support a family. Every male citizen had a voice in the town meeting.
   The town meeting levied taxes, built roads, and elected officials who
   managed town affairs. The towns did not have courts—that was a function
   of a larger unit, the county, whose officials were appointed by the
   state government.^[60]

   The Congregational Church, the church the Puritans founded, was not
   automatically joined by all New England residents because of Puritan
   beliefs that God singled out specific people for salvation. Instead,
   membership was limited to those who could convincingly "test" before
   members of the church that they had been saved. They were known as "the
   elect" or "Saints" and made up less than 40% of the population of New
   England.^[61]

Farm life[edit]

   A majority of New England residents were small farmers. Within these
   small farm families, and English families as well, a man had complete
   power over the property and his wife. When married, an English woman
   lost her maiden name and personal identity, meaning she could not own
   property, file lawsuits, or participate in political life, even when
   widowed. The role of wives was to raise and nurture healthy children
   and support their husbands. Most women carried out these duties.^[62]
   During the 18th century, couples usually married between the ages of
   20-24 and 6-8 children were typical of a family, with three on average
   surviving to adulthood. Farm women provided most of the materials
   needed by the rest of the family by spinning yarn from wool and
   knitting sweaters and stockings, making candles and soap from ashes,
   and churning milk into butter.^[63]
   long-term economic growth

   Most New England parents tried to help their sons establish farms of
   their own. When sons married, fathers gave them gifts of land,
   livestock, or farming equipment; daughters received household goods,
   farm animals, and/or cash. Arranged marriages were very unusual;
   normally, children chose their own spouses from within a circle of
   suitable acquaintances who shared their race, religion, and social
   standing. Parents retained veto power over their children's marriages.

   New England farming families generally lived in wooden houses because
   of the abundance of trees. A typical New England farmhouse was
   one-and-a-half stories tall and had a strong frame (usually made of
   large square timbers) that was covered by wooden clapboard siding. A
   large chimney stood in the middle of the house that provided cooking
   facilities and warmth during the winter. One side of the ground floor
   contained a hall, a general-purpose room where the family worked and
   ate meals. Adjacent to the hall was the parlor, a room used to
   entertain guests that contained the family's best furnishings and the
   parent's bed. Children slept in a loft above, while the kitchen was
   either part of the hall or was located in a shed along the back of the
   house. Because colonial families were large, these small dwellings had
   much activity and there was little privacy.

   By the middle of the 18th century, New England's way of life was
   threatened by overpopulation, going from about 100,000 people in 1700
   to 250,000 in 1725 and 375,000 in 1750 thanks to high birth rates and
   relatively high overall life expectancy (a 15 year old boy in 1700
   could expect to live to about 63). As colonists in Massachusetts,
   Connecticut, and Rhode Island continued to subdivide their land between
   farmers, the farms became too small to support single families. This
   overpopulation threatened the New England ideal of a society of
   independent yeoman farmers.^[64]

   Some farmers obtained land grants to create farms in undeveloped land
   in Massachusetts and Connecticut or bought plots of land from
   speculators in New Hampshire and what later became Vermont. Other
   farmers became agricultural innovators. They planted nutritious English
   grass such as red clover and timothy-grass, which provided more feed
   for livestock, and potatoes, which provided a high production rate that
   was an advantage for small farms. Families increased their productivity
   by exchanging goods and labor with each other. They loaned livestock
   and grazing land to one another and worked together to spin yarn, sew
   quilts, and shuck corn. Migration, agricultural innovation, and
   economic cooperation were creative measures that preserved New
   England's yeoman society until the 19th century.

Town life[edit]

   Saltbox-style homes originated in New England after 1650

   By the mid-18th century in New England, shipbuilding was a staple,
   particularly as the North American wilderness offered a seemingly
   endless supply of timber (by comparison, Europe's forests had been
   depleted and most timber had to be purchased from Scandinavia) The
   British crown often turned to the cheap, yet strongly built American
   ships. There was a shipyard at the mouth of almost every river in New
   England.

   By 1750, a variety of artisans, shopkeepers, and merchants provided
   services to the growing farming population. Blacksmiths, wheelwrights,
   and furniture makers set up shops in rural villages. There they built
   and repaired goods needed by farm families. Stores selling English
   manufactures such as cloth, iron utensils, and window glass as well as
   West Indian products like sugar and molasses were set up by traders.
   The storekeepers of these shops sold their imported goods in exchange
   for crops and other local products including roof shingles, potash, and
   barrel staves. These local goods were shipped to towns and cities all
   along the Atlantic Coast. Enterprising men set up stables and taverns
   along wagon roads to service this transportation system.

   After these products had been delivered to port towns such as Boston
   and Salem in Massachusetts, New Haven in Connecticut, and Newport and
   Providence in Rhode Island, merchants then exported them to the West
   Indies where they were traded for molasses, sugar, gold coins, and
   bills of exchange (credit slips). They carried the West Indian products
   to New England factories where the raw sugar was turned into granulated
   sugar and the molasses distilled into rum. The gold and credit slips
   were sent to England where they were exchanged for manufactures, which
   were shipped back to the colonies and sold along with the sugar and rum
   to farmers.

   Other New England merchants took advantage of the rich fishing areas
   along the Atlantic Coast and financed a large fishing fleet,
   transporting its catch of mackerel and cod to the West Indies and
   Europe. Some merchants exploited the vast amounts of timber along the
   coasts and rivers of northern New England. They funded sawmills that
   supplied cheap wood for houses and shipbuilding. Hundreds of New
   England shipwrights built oceangoing ships, which they sold to British
   and American merchants.

   Many merchants became very wealthy by providing their goods to the
   agricultural population and ended up dominating the society of sea port
   cities. Unlike yeoman farmhouses, these merchants resembled the
   lifestyle of that of the upper class of England living in elegant
   2 ^1⁄[2]-story houses designed the new Georgian style. These Georgian
   houses had a symmetrical façade with equal numbers of windows on both
   sides of the central door. The interior consisted of a passageway down
   the middle of the house with specialized rooms such as a library,
   dining room, formal parlor, and master bedroom off the sides. Unlike
   the multi-purpose space of the yeoman houses, each of these rooms
   served a separate purpose. In a Georgian house, men mainly used certain
   rooms, such as the library, while women mostly used the kitchen. These
   houses contained bedrooms on the second floor that provided privacy to
   parents and children.

Culture and education[edit]

   Main articles: History of education in the United States § Colonial Era
   and Education in Colonial America

   Education was primarily the responsibility of families, but numerous
   religious groups, especially the Puritans in New England, established
   tax-supported elementary schools so their children could read the
   Bible. Nearly all the religious denominations set up their own schools
   and colleges to train ministers. Each city, and most towns, had private
   academies for the children of affluent families.^[65]
   Massachusetts Hall, oldest surviving building at Harvard University,
   built 1718–1720 as a dormitory

   The practical sciences were of great interest to colonial Americans,
   who were engaged in the process of taming and settling a wild frontier
   country. While science could eventually be applied to political
   problems, the mainstream of intellectual activity in the colonies was
   on technological and engineering developments rather than more abstract
   topics such as politics or metaphysics. American scientific activity
   was symbolized by David Rittenhouse, who constructed the first
   planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, New York lieutenant governor
   Cadawaller Colden, botanist and anthropologist, and Dr. Benjamin Rush,
   the celebrated physician and social reformer and member of the American
   Philosophical Society founded by Benjamin Franklin, who had contributed
   important discoveries to physics such as electricity, but was more
   successful in his practical inventions such as stoves and lightning
   rods.

   The arts in colonial America were not as successful as the sciences.
   Literature in the European sense was nearly nonexistent, with histories
   being far more noteworthy. These included The History and present State
   of Virginia (1705) by Robert Beverly and History of the Dividing Line
   (1728–29) by William Byrd, which however was not published until a
   century later. Instead, the newspaper was the principle form of reading
   material in the colonies. Since printing was expensive, most
   publications focused on purely practical matters such as major news,
   advertisements, and business reports. Aside from newspapers, almanacs
   were very popular, Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac being the
   most famous. Literary magazines appeared at mid-century, but few were
   profitable and most went out of business after only a few years. While
   American publications never approached the intellectual quality of
   European writers, they were much more widespread and achieved a greater
   readership than anything produced by Voltaire, Locke, or Rousseau.

   New Englanders wrote journals, pamphlets, books and especially
   sermons—more than all of the other colonies combined. Cotton Mather, a
   Boston minister published Magnalia Christi Americana (The Great Works
   of Christ in America, 1702), while revivalist Jonathan Edwards wrote
   his philosophical work, A Careful and Strict Enquiry Into...Notions
   of...Freedom of Will... (1754). Most music had a religious theme as
   well and was mainly the singing of Psalms. Because of New England's
   deep religious beliefs, artistic works that were insufficiently
   religious or too "worldly" were banned, especially the theater. The
   leading theologian and philosopher of the colonial era was Jonathan
   Edwards of Massachusetts, an interpreter of Calvinism, and the leader
   of the First Great Awakening.

   Art and drama were somewhat more successful than literature. Benjamin
   West was a noteworthy painter of historical subjects and two first-rate
   portrait painters emerged in John Copley and Gilbert Stuart, yet all
   three men spent much of their lives in London. Theater was more
   developed in the Southern colonies, especially South Carolina, but
   nowhere did stage works attain the level of Europe. Puritans in New
   England and Quakers in Pennsylvania opposed theatrical performances as
   immoral and ungodly.

   Elementary education was widespread in New England. Early Puritan
   settlers believed it was necessary to study the Bible, so children were
   taught to read at an early age. It was also required that each town pay
   for a primary school. About 10 percent enjoyed secondary schooling and
   funded grammar schools in larger towns. Most boys learned skills from
   their fathers on the farm or as apprentices to artisans. Few girls
   attended formal schools, but most were able to get some education at
   home or at so-called "Dame schools" where women taught basic reading
   and writing skills in their own houses. By 1750, nearly 90% of New
   England's women and almost all of its men could read and write.
   Puritans founded Harvard College in 1636 and Yale College in 1701.
   Later, Baptists founded Rhode Island College (now Brown University) in
   1764 and Congregationalists established Dartmouth College in 1769.
   Virginia founded schools the College of William and Mary in 1693; it
   was primarily Anglican. The colleges were designed for aspiring
   ministers, lawyers or doctors. There were no departments or majors, as
   every student shared the same curriculum, which focused on Latin and
   Greek, mathematics, and history, philosophy, logic, ethics, rhetoric,
   oratory, and a little basic science. There were no sports or
   fraternities and few extracurricular activities apart from literary
   societies. There were no separate seminaries, law schools, or divinity
   schools. The first medical schools were founded late in the colonial
   era in Philadelphia and New York.^[66]

Religion[edit]

   Some migrants who came to Colonial America were in search of religious
   freedom. London did not make the Church of England official in the
   colonies—it never sent a bishop—so religious practice became
   diverse.^[67]

   The Great Awakening was a major religious revival movement that took
   place in most colonies in the 1730s and 1740s.^[68] The movement began
   with Jonathan Edwards, a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to
   the Pilgrims' strict Calvinist roots and to reawaken the "Fear of God."
   English preacher George Whitefield and other itinerant preachers
   continued the movement, traveling across the colonies and preaching in
   a dramatic and emotional style. Followers of Edwards and other
   preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the "New Lights", as
   contrasted with the "Old Lights", who disapproved of their movement. To
   promote their viewpoints, the two sides established academies and
   colleges, including Princeton and Williams College. The Great Awakening
   has been called the first truly American event.^[69]

   A similar pietistic revival movement took place among some German and
   Dutch settlers, leading to more divisions. By the 1770s, the Baptists
   were growing rapidly both in the north (where they founded Brown
   University), and in the South (where they challenged the previously
   unquestioned moral authority of the Anglican establishment).

Mid-Atlantic Region[edit]

   Unlike New England, the Mid-Atlantic Region gained much of its
   population from new immigration, and by 1750, the combined populations
   of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania had reached nearly 300,000
   people. By 1750, about 60,000 Irish and 50,000 Germans came to live in
   British North America, many of them settling in the Mid-Atlantic
   Region. William Penn, the man who founded the colony of Pennsylvania in
   1682, attracted an influx of British Quakers with his policies of
   religious liberty and freehold ownership. ("Freehold" meant owning land
   free and clear, with the right to resell it to anyone.) The first major
   influx of settlers were the Scotch Irish, who headed to the frontier.
   Many Germans came to escape the religious conflicts and declining
   economic opportunities in Germany and Switzerland.

Ways of life[edit]

   Much of the architecture of the Middle Colonies reflects the diversity
   of its peoples. In Albany and New York City, a majority of the
   buildings were Dutch style with brick exteriors and high gables at each
   end while many Dutch churches were shaped liked an octagon. Using cut
   stone to build their houses, German and Welsh settlers in Pennsylvania
   followed the way of their homeland and completely ignored the plethora
   of timber in the area. An example of this would be Germantown,
   Pennsylvania where 80 percent of the buildings in the town were made
   entirely of stone. On the other hand, settlers from Ireland took
   advantage of America's ample supply of timber and constructed sturdy
   log cabins.

   Ethnic cultures also affected the styles of furniture. Rural Quakers
   preferred simple designs in furnishings such as tables, chairs, chests
   and shunned elaborate decorations. However, some urban Quakers had much
   more elaborate furniture. The city of Philadelphia became a major
   center of furniture-making because of its massive wealth from Quaker
   and British merchants. Philadelphian cabinet makers built elegant desks
   and highboys. German artisans created intricate carved designs on their
   chests and other furniture with painted scenes of flowers and birds.
   German potters also crafted a large array of jugs, pots, and plates, of
   both elegant and traditional design.

   There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan
   settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with
   their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many
   women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted
   women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local
   English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives
   owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability
   to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.

   By the time of the Revolutionary War, approximately 85 percent of white
   Americans were of English, Irish, Welsh, or Scottish descent.
   Approximately 8.8 percent of whites were of German ancestry, and 3.5
   percent were of Dutch origin.

Farming[edit]

   Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice. As an example,
   German farmers generally preferred oxen rather than horses to pull
   their plows and Scots-Irish made a farming economy based on hogs and
   corn. In Ireland, people farmed intensively, working small pieces of
   land trying to get the largest possible production-rate from their
   crops. In the American colonies, settlers from northern Ireland focused
   on mixed-farming. Using this technique, they grew corn for human
   consumption and as feed for hogs and other livestock. Many
   improvement-minded farmers of all different backgrounds began using new
   agricultural practices to raise their output. During the 1750s, these
   agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and scythes used to
   harvest hay, wheat, and barley with the cradle scythe, a tool with
   wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection.
   This tool was able to triple the amount of work done by farmers in one
   day. Farmers also began fertilizing their fields with dung and lime and
   rotating their crops to keep the soil fertile. By 1700, Philadelphia
   was exporting 350,000 bushels of wheat and 18,000 tons of flour
   annually. The Southern colonies in particular relied on cash crops such
   as tobacco and cotton. South Carolina produced rice and indigo. North
   Carolina was somewhat less involved in the plantation economy, but
   because a major producer of naval stores. Virginia and Maryland came to
   be almost totally dependent on tobacco, which would ultimately prove
   fatal at the end of the 18th century thanks to exhausted soil and
   collapsing prices, but for most of the century, the soil remained good
   and a single-crop economy profitable.

   Before 1720, most colonists in the mid-Atlantic region worked with
   small-scale farming and paid for imported manufactures by supplying the
   West Indies with corn and flour. In New York, a fur-pelt export trade
   to Europe flourished adding additional wealth to the region. After
   1720, mid-Atlantic farming stimulated with the international demand for
   wheat. A massive population explosion in Europe brought wheat prices
   up. By 1770, a bushel of wheat cost twice as much as it did in 1720.
   Farmers also expanded their production of flax seed and corn since flax
   was a high demand in the Irish linen industry and a demand for corn
   existed in the West Indies. Thus, by mid-century, most colonial farming
   was a commercial venture, although subsistence agriculture continued to
   exist in New England and the middle colonies.

   Some immigrants who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this
   export wealth, but many poor German and Irish immigrants were forced to
   work as agricultural wage laborers. Merchants and artisans also hired
   these homeless workers for a domestic system for the manufacture of
   cloth and other goods. Merchants often bought wool and flax from
   farmers and employed newly arrived immigrants, who had been textile
   workers in Ireland and Germany, to work in their homes spinning the
   materials into yarn and cloth. Large farmers and merchants became
   wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough
   for subsistence. The Mid-Atlantic region, by 1750, was divided by both
   ethnic background and wealth.

Seaports[edit]

   Seaports, which expanded from wheat trade, had more social classes than
   anywhere else in the Middle Colonies. By 1750, the population of
   Philadelphia had reached 25,000, New York 15,000, and the port of
   Baltimore 7,000. Merchants dominated seaport society and about 40
   merchants controlled half of Philadelphia's trade. Wealthy merchants in
   Philadelphia and New York, like their counterparts in New England,
   built elegant Georgian-style mansions.

   Shopkeepers, artisans, shipwrights, butchers, coopers, seamstresses,
   cobblers, bakers, carpenters, masons, and many other specialized
   professions, made up the middle class of seaport society. Wives and
   husbands often worked as a team and taught their children their crafts
   to pass it on through the family. Many of these artisans and traders
   made enough money to create a modest life.

   Laborers stood at the bottom of seaport society. These poor people
   worked on the docks unloading inbound vessels and loading outbound
   vessels with wheat, corn, and flaxseed. Many of these were African
   American; some were free while others were enslaved. In 1750, blacks
   made up about 10 percent of the population of New York and
   Philadelphia. Hundreds of seamen, some who were African American,
   worked as sailors on merchant ships.

Southern Colonies[edit]

   The Southern Colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy planters in
   Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. They owned increasingly large
   plantations that were worked by African slaves. Of the 650,000
   inhabitants of the South in 1750, about 250,000 or 40 percent, were
   slaves. The plantations grew tobacco, indigo and rice for export, and
   raised most of their own food supplies.^[70] In addition, many small
   subsistence farms were family owned and operated by yeoman. Most white
   men owned some land, and therefore could vote.^[71]

Women in the South[edit]

   Since the social history revolution in the 1970s historians have paid
   special attention to the role of women, family and gender in the
   colonial South.^[72]^[73]^[74] In the early Chesapeake colonies, very
   few women were present. In 1650, estimates put Maryland's total
   population near six hundred with fewer than two hundred women
   present.^[75] Much of the population consisted of young, single, white
   indentured servants, and as such the colonies, to a large degree,
   lacked any social cohesiveness. African women entered the colony as
   early as 1619, although their status: free, slave or indentured servant
   remains a historical debate. In the 17th century high mortality rates
   for newcomers and a very high ratio of men to women made family life
   either impossible or unstable for most colonists. These factors, along
   with dispersed settlements and a reluctance to live in villages,
   together with a growing immigration of white indentured servants and
   black slaves made families and communities in the Virginia-Maryland
   region before 1700 fundamentally different from their counterparts in
   Europe and New England. These extreme conditions both demeaned and
   empowered women. Lacking male protectors, women, especially teenage
   girls who were indentured servants, often were vulnerable to
   exploitation and abuse. On the other hand, without parental oversight,
   young women had much more freedom in choosing spouses, and the shortage
   of eligible women enabled them to use marriage as an avenue to upward
   mobility. The high death rates meant that Chesapeake wives generally
   became widows who inherited property; many widows increased their
   property by remarrying as soon as possible. The population began to
   stabilize around 1700, with a 1704 census listing 30,437 white people
   present with 7,163 of those being women.^[75] Women married younger,
   remained wed longer, bore more children, and lost influence within the
   family polity.^[76]

Slaves[edit]

   Main article: Slavery in Colonial America

   Slaves imported to American colonies^[77]
     * 1620-1700.....21,000
     * 1701-1760....189,000
     * 1761-1770.....63,000
     * 1771-1790.....56,000
     * 1791-1800.....79,000
     * 1801-1810....124,000^[78]
     * 1810-1865.....51,000
     * Total ..........597,000

   About 600,000 slaves were imported into the U.S., or 5% of the 12
   million slaves brought across from Africa. The great majority went to
   sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy
   was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. Life
   expectancy was much higher in the U.S. (because of better food, less
   disease, lighter work loads, and better medical care) so the numbers
   grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths, reaching 4 million by
   the 1860 Census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of
   North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any
   nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that of
   England.^[79]

   The enslaved African (known as African slaves, although they were not
   considered slaves until they were officially purchased by a planter or
   plantation owner) who worked on the indigo, tobacco, and rice fields in
   the South came from mainly western and central Africa. Slavery in
   Colonial America was very oppressive as it passed on from generation to
   generation, and slaves had no legal rights. The colonies that had the
   most specialization in production of goods, such as sugar and coffee,
   relied most on slaves and consequently, had the highest per capita
   (including slaves) income in the New World. However, the slaves did not
   accrue wages or receive rights and provided free labor to those who
   purchased them and received just enough to live. They were considered
   in Chattel slavery. Between 1500 and 1700, over 60% of the 6 million
   people who were brought or traveled to the New World were involuntary
   slaves. In 1700, there were about 9,600 slaves in the Chesapeake region
   and a few hundred in the Carolinas. About 170,000 more Africans were
   forcibly brought over the next five decades. By 1750, there were more
   than 250,000 slaves in British America; and, in the Carolinas, they
   made up about 60 percent of the total population. The first
   post-colonial Census found 697,681 slaves and 59,527 free blacks, who
   together made up about 20% of the country's population. Most slaves in
   South Carolina were born in Africa, while half the slaves in Virginia
   and Maryland were born in the colonies.^[citation needed]
