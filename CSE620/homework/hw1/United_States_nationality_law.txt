   Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the United States Constitution
   expressly gives the United States Congress the power to establish a
   uniform rule of naturalization.^[2] The Immigration and Nationality Act
   of 1952 sets forth the legal requirements for the acquisition of, and
   divestiture from, American nationality. The requirements have become
   more explicit since the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
   Constitution, with the most recent changes to statutory law having been
   made by the United States Congress in 2001.

Rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens[edit]

Rights of citizens[edit]

   See also: Voting rights in the United States

   Adult citizens of the United States who are residents of one of the 50
   states or the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) have the right to
   participate in the political system of the United States, as well as
   their state and local governments (with most states having restrictions
   on voting by persons convicted of felonies, and a federal
   constitutional prohibition on naturalized persons running for President
   and Vice President of the United States), to be represented and
   protected abroad by the United States (through U.S. embassies and
   consulates), and to live in the United States and certain territories
   without any immigration requirements.

Responsibilities of citizens[edit]

   Some^[3] U.S. citizens have the obligation to serve in a jury, if
   selected and legally qualified. Citizens are also required (under the
   provisions of the Internal Revenue Code) to pay taxes on their total
   income from all sources worldwide, including income earned abroad while
   living abroad. Under certain circumstances, however, U.S. citizens
   living and working abroad may be able to reduce or eliminate their U.S.
   federal income tax via the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion and/or the
   Foreign Tax Credit.^[4] U.S. taxes payable may be alternatively reduced
   by credits for foreign income taxes regardless of the length of stay
   abroad. The United States Government also insists that U.S. citizens
   travel into and out of the United States on a U.S. passport, regardless
   of any other nationality they may possess.^[citation needed]

   Male U.S. citizens (including those living permanently abroad and/or
   with dual U.S./other citizenship) from 18–25 years of age are required
   to register with the Selective Service System at age 18 for possible
   conscription into the armed forces. Although no one has been drafted in
   the U.S. since 1973, draft registration continues in the case of a
   possible reinstatement on some future date.^[5]

   In the Oath of Citizenship, immigrants becoming naturalized U.S.
   citizens swear that when required by law they will bear arms on behalf
   of the United States, will perform noncombatant service in the U.S.
   Armed Forces, and will perform work of national importance under
   civilian direction. In some cases, the USCIS allows the oath to be
   taken without the clauses regarding the first two of these three sworn
   commitments.^[6]

Acquisition of citizenship[edit]

   There are various ways a person can acquire United States citizenship,
   either at birth or later on in life.

Birth within the United States[edit]

   Main articles: Birthright citizenship in the United States and Jus soli

   Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
   provides that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States,
   and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United
   States and of the State wherein they reside."

   In the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898), the
   Supreme Court ruled that a person becomes a citizen of the United
   States at the time of birth, by virtue of the first clause of the 14th
   Amendment, if that person:
     * Is born in the United States
     * Has parents that are subjects of a foreign power, but not in any
       diplomatic or official capacity of that foreign power
     * Has parents that have permanent domicile and residence in the
       United States
     * Has parents that are in the United States for business

   The Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled on whether children born
   in the United States to illegal immigrant parents are entitled to
   birthright citizenship via the 14th Amendment,^[7] but it has generally
   been assumed that they are.^[8]

Through birth abroad to United States citizens[edit]

   See also: jus sanguinis

Birth abroad to two United States citizens[edit]

   A child is automatically granted citizenship if:
    1. Both parents were U.S. citizens at the time of the child's birth;
    2. The parents are married; and
    3. At least one parent lived in the United States prior to the child's
       birth. INA 301(c) and INA 301(a)(3) state, "and one of whom has had
       a residence."

   The FAM (Foreign Affairs Manual) states "no amount of time specified."

   A person's record of birth abroad, if registered with a U.S. consulate
   or embassy, is proof of citizenship. They may also apply for a passport
   or a Certificate of Citizenship as proof of citizenship.

Birth abroad to one United States citizen[edit]

   A person born on or after November 14, 1986, is a U.S. citizen if all
   of the following are true:^[9]
    1. The person's parents were married at time of birth
    2. One of the person's parents was a U.S. citizen when the person in
       question was born
    3. The citizen parent lived at least five years in the United States
       before the child's birth
    4. A minimum of two of these five years in the United States were
       after the citizen parent's 14th birthday.

   INA 301(g) makes additional provisions to satisfy the physical-presence
   requirements for periods citizens spent abroad in "honorable service in
   the Armed Forces of the United States, or periods of employment with
   the United States Government or with an international organization."
   Additionally citizens, who spent time living abroad as the "dependent
   unmarried son or daughter and a member of the household of a person" in
   any of the previously mentioned organizations can also be counted.

   A person's record of birth abroad, if registered with a U.S. consulate
   or embassy, is proof of citizenship. Such a person may also apply for a
   passport or a Certificate of Citizenship to have a record of
   citizenship. Such documentation is often useful to prove citizenship in
   lieu of the availability of an American birth certificate.

   Different rules apply for persons born abroad to one U.S. citizen
   before November 14, 1986. United States law on this subject changed
   multiple times throughout the twentieth century, and the law is
   applicable as it existed at the time of the individual's birth.

   For persons born between December 24, 1952 and November 14, 1986, a
   person is a U.S. citizen if all of the following are true:^[9]
    1. The person's parents were married at the time of birth
    2. One of the person's parents was a U.S. citizen when the person was
       born
    3. The citizen parent lived at least ten years in the United States
       before the child's birth;
    4. A minimum of 5 of these 10 years in the United States were after
       the citizen parent's 14th birthday.

   For persons born out of wedlock, the person is a U.S. citizen if all
   the following apply:
    1. the mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the person's birth and
    2. the mother was physically present in the United States or one of
       its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year prior
       to the person's birth.^[10] (See link for those born to a U.S.
       father out of wedlock)^[9]

Adoption[edit]

   The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (CCA), which went into effect on
   February 27, 2001, amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to
   provide U.S. citizenship to certain foreign-born children—including
   adopted children—of U.S. citizens.^[11]

Naturalization[edit]

   A judge swears in a new citizen. New York, 1910

   A person who was not born a U.S. citizen may acquire U.S. citizenship
   through a process known as naturalization.

Eligibility for naturalization[edit]

   See also: Ideological restrictions on naturalization in U.S. law

   To become a naturalized United States citizen, one must be at least
   eighteen years of age at the time of filing, a legal permanent resident
   (or non-citizen national) of the United States, and have had a status
   of a legal permanent resident in the United States for five years
   before they apply (this requirement is reduced to three years if they
   (a) acquired legal permanent resident status, (b) have been married to
   and living with a citizen for the past three years and (c) the spouse
   has been a U.S. citizen for at least three years prior to the applicant
   applying for naturalization.) They must have been physically present
   for at least 30 months of 60 months prior to the date of filing their
   application. Also during those 60 months if the legal permanent
   resident was outside of the U.S. for a continuous period of 6 months or
   more they are disqualified from naturalizing (certain exceptions apply
   for those continuous periods of six months to 1 year). They must be a
   "person of good moral character", and must pass a test on United States
   history and government.^[12]^[13] Most applicants must also have a
   working knowledge of the English language.^[12] There are exceptions,
   introduced in 1990, for long-resident older applicants and those with
   mental or physical disabilities.^[14]^[15]

   A non-citizen U.S. national (see below) is also eligible for
   naturalization after becoming a resident of any state.^[12]^[16]

Citizenship test[edit]

   Applicants for citizenship are asked ten questions, and must answer at
   least six with the expected answers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
   Services has published a list of 100 sample questions (with the answers
   that should be given when taking the test), from which the questions
   asked are always drawn. The full list of questions is in the document
   "A Guide to Naturalization", available for free from the USCIS.^[17]

New naturalization test and interview[edit]

   There is a new naturalization test that is being used for all N-400
   applications^[clarification needed] filed on or after October 1,
   2008.^[18] If the applicant filed the N-400 application before October
   1, 2008 then the applicant may choose to take the new test or the old
   test. The new test examines the applicant's knowledge of American
   society and the English language. Sample questions and answers are
   published by the USCIS in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog,
   Vietnamese and Azerbaijani.^[19]

   Besides passing the citizenship test, citizenship applicants must also
   satisfy other specific requirements of naturalization to successfully
   obtain U.S. citizenship.^[20]

   An applicant will also be required to submit to an in-person interview.

Eligibility for public office[edit]

   A person who becomes a U.S. citizen through naturalization is not
   considered a natural born citizen. Consequently, naturalized U.S.
   citizens are not eligible to become President of the United States or
   Vice President of the United States, which would ordinarily be the case
   as established by the Presidential Succession Act. For example, though
   the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor are tenth and
   eleventh in the presidential line of succession, Elaine Chao and Carlos
   Gutierrez (respectively former U.S. Secretaries of Labor and Commerce
   under President George W. Bush) would have been unable to succeed to
   the presidency because they became U.S. citizens through
   naturalization. The highest-ranking naturalized citizens to have been
   excluded from the Presidential Line of Succession were Henry Kissinger
   and Madeleine Albright, each of whom would have been fourth in line as
   Secretary of State had they been natural born citizens.

   Whether this restriction applies to children born to non-U.S. citizens
   but adopted as minors by U.S. citizens is a matter of some debate,
   since the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 is ambiguous as to whether
   acquisition of citizenship by that route is to be regarded as
   naturalized or natural-born. Those who argue that the restriction does
   not apply point out that the child automatically becomes a citizen even
   though violating every single requirement of eligibility for
   naturalization, and thus the case falls closer to the situation of
   birth abroad to U.S. citizens than to naturalization. This
   interpretation is in concert with the wording of the Naturalization Act
   of 1790, that "the children of citizens of the United States that may
   be born beyond the sea, or out of the limits of the United States,
   shall be considered as natural born citizens", which does not draw a
   distinction between biological children and adopted children, even
   though the process of adoption was certainly well known at the
   time.^[citation needed]^[dubious – discuss]

   Some argue that the phrase "natural born citizen" describes a category
   of citizenship distinct from that described by the phrase "U.S.
   Citizen" in Article Two of the United States Constitution, and this was
   discussed during the constitutional convention of 1787.^[21] While it
   is true that "natural born citizen" is not defined anywhere within the
   text of the Constitution and that the Constitution makes use of the
   phrase "citizen" and "natural born citizen", Supreme Court Decisions
   from United States v. Wong Kim Ark to the present have considered the
   distinction to be between natural-born and naturalized citizenship.

   In her 1988 article in the Yale Law Journal, Jill Pryor wrote, "It is
   well settled that 'native-born' citizens, those born in the United
   States, qualify as natural born. It is also clear that persons born
   abroad of alien parents, who later become citizens by naturalization,
   do not. But whether a person born abroad of American parents, or of one
   American and one alien parent, qualifies as natural born has never been
   resolved."^[22]

   An April 2000 CRS report by the Congressional Research Service, asserts
   that most constitutional scholars interpret the phrase "natural born
   citizen" as including citizens born outside the United States to
   parents who are U.S. citizens under the "natural born"
   requirement.^[23]

   Chester Arthur, born in the U.S. state of Vermont of an American mother
   and Irish father, was sworn in as President, but his status as a
   "natural-born citizen" was challenged on the grounds that he was
   allegedly born in Canada or Ireland. Presidential candidates George W.
   Romney (born in Mexico), Barry Goldwater and John McCain (born in U.S.
   territories), were never seriously challenged on the basis of their
   "natural born" citizenship, but no candidate falling under this
   classification has been elected President.

Expeditious naturalization of children[edit]

   Effective April 1, 1995, a child born outside the U.S. to a U.S.
   citizen parent, if not already a citizen by birth because the parent
   does not meet the residency requirement (see above), may qualify for
   expeditious naturalization based on the physical presence of the
   child's grandparent in the U.S. In general the grandparent should have
   spent five years in the U.S., at least two of which were after the age
   of 14.

   The process of naturalization, including the oath of allegiance, must
   be completed before the child's 18th birthday. It is not necessary for
   the child to be admitted to the U.S. as a lawful permanent
   resident.^[24]

Child Citizenship Act of 2000[edit]

   Effective February 27, 2001, the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 provided
   that a non-U.S. citizen child (aged under 18) with a U.S. citizen
   parent, and in the custody of that parent while resident in the United
   States, automatically acquired U.S. citizenship. To be eligible, a
   child must meet the definition of "child" for naturalization purposes
   under immigration law, and must also meet the following requirements:
     * The child has at least one United States citizen parent (by birth
       or naturalization)
     * The child is under 18 years of age
     * The child is currently residing permanently in the United States in
       the legal and physical custody of the United States citizen parent
     * The child has been admitted to the United States as a lawful
       permanent resident or has been adjusted to this status
     * An adopted child must also meet the requirements applicable to the
       particular provision under which they qualified for admission as an
       adopted child under immigration law

Dual citizenship[edit]

   Based on the U.S. Department of State regulation on dual citizenship (7
   FAM 1162), the Supreme Court of the United States has stated that dual
   citizenship is a "status long recognized in the law" and that "a person
   may have and exercise rights of nationality in two countries and be
   subject to the responsibilities of both. The mere fact he asserts the
   rights of one citizenship does not without more mean that he renounces
   the other", (Kawakita v. U.S., 343 U.S. 717) (1952). In Schneider v.
   Rusk 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a
   naturalized U.S. citizen has the right to return to his native country
   and to resume his former citizenship, and also to remain a U.S. citizen
   even if he never returns to the United States.

   The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) neither defines dual
   citizenship nor takes a position for it or against it. There has been
   no prohibition against dual citizenship, but some provisions of the INA
   and earlier U.S. nationality laws were designed to reduce situations in
   which dual citizenship exists. Although naturalizing citizens are
   required to undertake an oath renouncing previous allegiances, the oath
   has never been enforced to require the actual termination of original
   citizenship.^[25]

   Although the U.S. government does not endorse dual citizenship as a
   matter of policy, it recognizes the existence of dual citizenship and
   completely tolerates the maintenance of multiple citizenship by U.S.
   citizens. In the past, claims of other countries on dual-national U.S.
   citizens sometimes placed them in situations where their obligations to
   one country were in conflict with the laws of the other. The 2012 case
   of American-Thai dual national Joe Gordon is a case in point, who
   entered Thailand using a U.S. passport but was convicted and imprisoned
   in May 2011 for Lèse majesté in Thailand.^[26] However, as fewer
   countries require military service and most base other obligations,
   such as the payment of taxes, on residence and not citizenship, these
   conflicts have become less frequent.^[27] As a result, there has been a
   dramatic increase in recent years in the number of people who maintain
   U.S. citizenship despite residing in other countries.^[citation needed]

   A U.S. citizen may lose his dual citizenship by obtaining
   naturalization in a foreign state, taking an oath or making an
   affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign
   state or political subdivision thereof, or serving in the armed forces
   of a foreign state, but only if it was performed with the intention of
   renouncing U.S. citizenship.^[28]

   One circumstance where dual citizenship may run counter to expectations
   of government agencies is in matters of security clearance. For
   example, any person granted a Yankee White vetting must be absolutely
   free of foreign influence, and for other security clearances one of the
   grounds that may result in a rejected application is an actual or
   potential conflict of national allegiances.

Nationals who are not citizens[edit]

   This article is about United States nationality law. For information
   regarding United States citizenship, see Citizenship in the United
   States.

   Although all U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals, the reverse is not
   true. As specified in 8 U.S.C. § 1408, a person whose only connection
   to the U.S. is through birth in an outlying possession (which is
   defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101 as American Samoa and Swains Island (which
   is administered as part of American Samoa)), or through descent from a
   person so born, acquires U.S. nationality but not U.S. citizenship.
   This was formerly the case in only four other current or former U.S.
   overseas possessions.^[29]
     * Guam (1898–1950) (Citizenship granted by an Act of Congress through
       the Guam Organic Act of 1950).
     * the Philippines (1898–1935) (Granted independence in 1946; National
       status rescinded in 1935; Citizenship never accorded)^[30]
     * Puerto Rico (1898–1917) (Citizenship granted by an Act of Congress
       through the Jones–Shafroth Act of 1917).
     * the U.S. Virgin Islands (1917–1927) (Citizenship granted by an Act
       of Congress in 1927).^[31]

   The nationality status of a person born in an unincorporated U.S. Minor
   Outlying Island is not specifically mentioned by law, but under
   international law and Supreme Court dicta, they are also regarded as
   non-citizen U.S. nationals.^[32]

   In addition, residents of the Northern Mariana Islands who
   automatically gained U.S. citizenship in 1986 as a result of the
   Covenant between the Northern Marianas and the U.S. could elect to
   become non-citizen nationals within 6 months of the implementation of
   the Covenant or within 6 months of turning 18.^[33]

   The U.S. passport issued to non-citizen nationals contains the
   endorsement code 9 which states: "THE BEARER IS A UNITED STATES
   NATIONAL AND NOT A UNITED STATES CITIZEN." on the annotations
   page.^[34]

   Non-citizen U.S. nationals may reside and work in the United States
   without restrictions, and may apply for citizenship under the same
   rules as resident aliens. Like resident aliens, they are not presently
   allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections,
   although, as with resident aliens, there is no constitutional
   prohibition against their doing so.

   Like U.S. citizens, non-citizen U.S. nationals may transmit their
   non-citizen U.S. nationality to children born abroad, although the
   rules are somewhat different than for U.S. citizens.^[35]

Citizenship at birth on the U.S. territories and former U.S.
territories[edit]

   The 14th amendment applies to incorporated territories, so people born
   in incorporated territories of the U.S. (currently, only the Palmyra
   Atoll) are automatically U.S. citizens at birth.^[36]

   Separate sections of law handle territories that the United States has
   acquired over time, such as Alaska 8 U.S.C. § 1404 and Hawaii 8
   U.S.C. § 1405, both incorporated, and unincorporated Puerto Rico 8
   U.S.C. § 1402, the U.S. Virgin Islands 8 U.S.C. § 1406, and Guam 8
   U.S.C. § 1407. Each of these sections confer citizenship on persons
   living in these territories as of a certain date, and usually confer
   native-born status on persons born in incorporated territories after
   that date.^[37]

   For example, for Puerto Rico, all persons born in Puerto Rico between
   April 11, 1899, and January 12, 1941, are automatically conferred
   citizenship as of the date the law was signed by the President Harry S.
   Truman on June 27, 1952. Additionally, all persons born in Puerto Rico
   on or after January 13, 1941, are native-born citizens of Puerto Rico,
   but only naturalized citizens at birth of the United States. Note that
   because of when the law was passed, for some, the citizenship status
   was retroactive.

   The law contains one other section of historical note, concerning the
   Panama Canal Zone and the nation of Panama. In 8 U.S.C. § 1403, the law
   states that anyone born in the Canal Zone or in Panama itself, on or
   after February 26, 1904, to a mother and/or father who is a United
   States citizen, was "declared" to be a (naturalized) United States
   citizen at birth.

   All persons born in the U.S. Virgin Islands on or after February 25,
   1927, are native-born citizens of the United States. The 8
   U.S.C. § 1406 also indicate that all the persons and their children
   born in the U.S. Virgin Islands subsequent to January 17, 1917, and
   prior to February 25, 1927, are declared to be citizens of the United
   States as of February 25, 1927 if complied with the U.S. law
   dispositions.

   All persons born in Alaska on or after June 2, 1924, are native-born
   citizens of the United States. Alaska was declared a U.S. State on
   January 3, 1959.

   All persons born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, are native-born
   citizens of the United States. Hawaii was declared a U.S. State on
   August 21, 1959.

   All persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899
   (whether before or after August 1, 1950) subject to the jurisdiction of
   the United States, are declared to be citizens of the United States.

   Currently under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA)
   effective from December 24, 1952 to present the definition of the
   "United States" for nationality purposes, was expanded to add Guam;
   and, effective November 3, 1986, the Northern Mariana Islands (in
   addition to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of the United
   States).^[38] Persons born in these territories on or after December
   24, 1952 acquire U.S. citizenship at birth on the same terms as persons
   born in other parts of the United States; and "Outlying possessions of
   the United States" was restricted to American Samoa and Swains
   Island.^[39]

   Congressional Research Service Report number RL30527 of April 17, 2000,
   titled "Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer" asserts
   that citizens born in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands
   are legally defined as natural born citizens, and are, therefore, also
   eligible to be elected President.^[40]

Loss of citizenship[edit]

   See also: List of former United States citizens who relinquished their
   nationality and List of denaturalized former citizens of the United
   States

   As a historical matter, U.S. citizenship could be forfeited upon the
   undertaking of various acts, including naturalization in a foreign
   state (with a willful intent to renounce U.S. citizenship) or service
   in foreign armed forces. In addition, before 1967 it was possible to
   lose the citizenship due to voting in foreign elections. However, the
   Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provisions of Section 349(a)
   which provided for loss of nationality by voting in a foreign election
   in the case Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253,^[41] 8 U.S.C. § 1481
   specifically outlines how loss of nationality may occur, which
   predominantly involves willful acts over the age of 18 with the
   intention of relinquishing United States nationality. U.S. Supreme
   Court decisions beginning with Afroyim v. Rusk constitutionally limited
   the government's capacity to terminate citizenship to those cases in
   which an individual engaged in conduct with an intention of abandoning
   their citizenship.

   In 1990, the U.S. State Department adopted new regulations which
   presume that an individual does not intend to give up citizenship when
   performing one of the above potentially expatriating acts.^[42] If
   asked, the individual can always answer that they did not intend to
   give it up; this is sufficient to retain their citizenship.^[43] Hence,
   the U.S. effectively allows citizens to acquire new citizenships while
   remaining a U.S. citizen, becoming a dual citizen.

   After a U.S. citizen satisfies the Department of State procedures, the
   Department of State issues a Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN)
   signifying that the Department of State has accepted the U.S.
   Embassy/Consulate's recommendation to allow the renunciation.^[44]
   Renunciation of citizenship includes renunciation of all rights and
   privileges of citizenship. A person who wants to renounce U.S.
   citizenship cannot decide to retain some of the privileges of
   citizenship, as the State Department regards this as logically
   inconsistent with the concept of renunciation. Thus, such a person can
   be said to lack a full understanding of renouncing citizenship and/or
   lack the necessary intent to renounce citizenship, and the Department
   of State will not approve a loss of citizenship in such instances.^[45]

   People giving up U.S. citizenship may be subject to an expatriation
   tax. Originally, under the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, people
   determined to be giving up citizenship for the purpose of avoiding U.S.
   taxation were subject to 10 years of continued taxation on their
   U.S.-source income, to prevent ex-citizens from taking advantage of
   special tax incentives offered to foreigners investing in the United
   States.^[46] Since 2008, these provisions no longer apply; instead,
   ex-citizens who meet certain asset or tax liability thresholds pay a
   one-time capital gains tax on a deemed sale of their U.S. and non-U.S.
   assets, regardless of their reasons for giving up citizenship.^[47] The
   Reed Amendment, a 1996 law, makes former citizens inadmissible to the
   U.S. if the Attorney General finds that they renounced citizenship for
   purposes of avoiding taxes; however, it has never been
   enforced.^[48]^[49] Proposals such as the Ex-PATRIOT Act to rewrite the
   Reed Amendment and make it enforceable failed in 2012 and 2013.

   It is also possible to forfeit U.S. citizenship upon conviction for an
   act of treason against the United States.^[43] Prominent former Nazi
   officers who acquired American citizenship have also had it revoked if
   the Office of Special Investigations has been able to prove that the
   citizenship was obtained by concealing their involvement in war crimes
   committed by the Nazis in World War II.^[50]^[51]
