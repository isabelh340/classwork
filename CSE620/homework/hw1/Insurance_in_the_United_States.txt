   Insurance in the United States refers to the market for risk in the
   United States of America. Insurance, generally, is a contract in which
   the insurer (stock insurance company, mutual insurance company,
   reciprocal, or Lloyd's syndicate, for example), agrees to compensate or
   indemnify another party (the insured, the policyholder or a
   beneficiary) for specified loss or damage to a specified thing (e.g.,
   an item, property or life) from certain perils or risks in exchange for
   a fee (the insurance premium).^[1] For example, a property insurance
   company may agree to bear the risk that a particular piece of property
   (e.g., a car or a house) may suffer a specific type or types of damage
   or loss during a certain period of time in exchange for a fee from the
   policyholder who would otherwise be responsible for that damage or
   loss. That agreement takes the form of an insurance policy.^[2]
   “ Insurance provides indemnification against loss or liability from
     specified events and circumstances that may occur or be discovered
     during a specified period.                                         ”

History[edit]

   See also: History of insurance

   The first insurance company in the United States underwrote fire
   insurance and was formed in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1735.^[3] In
   1752, Benjamin Franklin helped form a mutual insurance company called
   the Philadelphia Contributionship, which is the nation’s oldest
   insurance carrier still in operation.^[4]^[5] Franklin's company was
   the first to make contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did
   his company warn against certain fire hazards, it refused to insure
   certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all
   wooden houses.^[citation needed]

   The first stock insurance company formed in the United States was the
   Insurance Company of North America in 1792.^[6] Massachusetts enacted
   the first state law requiring insurance companies to maintain adequate
   reserves in 1837. Formal regulation of the insurance industry began in
   earnest when the first state commissioner of insurance was appointed in
   New Hampshire in 1851. In 1869, the State of New York appointed its own
   commissioner of insurance and created a state insurance department to
   move towards more comprehensive regulation of insurance at the state
   level.^[7]

   Insurance and the insurance industry has grown, diversified and
   developed significantly ever since. Insurance companies were, in large
   part, prohibited from writing more than one line of insurance until
   laws began to permit multi-line charters in the 1950s. From an industry
   dominated by small, local, single-line mutual companies and member
   societies, the business of insurance has grown increasingly towards
   multi-line, multi-state and even multi-national insurance conglomerates
   and holding companies.^[3]

Regulation[edit]

   Main article: Insurance Regulatory Law

The State-Based Insurance Regulatory System[edit]

   Historically, the insurance industry in the United States was regulated
   almost exclusively by the individual state governments. The first state
   commissioner of insurance was appointed in New Hampshire in 1851 and
   the state-based insurance regulatory system grew as quickly as the
   insurance industry itself.^[8] Prior to this period, insurance was
   primarily regulated by corporate charter, state statutory law and de
   facto regulation by the courts in judicial decisions.^[9]^[10]

   Under the state-based insurance regulation system, each state operates
   independently to regulate their own insurance markets, typically
   through a state department of insurance. Stretching back as far as the
   Paul v. Virginia case in 1869, challenges to the state-based insurance
   regulatory system have risen from various groups, both within and
   without the insurance industry. The state regulatory system has been
   described as cumbersome, redundant, confusing and costly.^[11]

   The United States Supreme Court found in the 1944 case of United States
   v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association that the business of
   insurance was subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause
   of the U.S. Constitution.^[12] The United States Congress, however,
   responded almost immediately with the McCarran-Ferguson Act in
   1945.^[13] The McCarran-Ferguson Act specifically provides that the
   regulation of the business of insurance by the state governments is in
   the public interest. Further, the Act states that no federal law should
   be construed to invalidate, impair or supersede any law enacted by any
   state government for the purpose of regulating the business of
   insurance, unless the federal law specifically relates to the business
   of insurance.^[14]

   A wave of insurance company insolvencies in the 1980s sparked a renewed
   interest in federal insurance regulation, including new legislation for
   a dual state and federal system of insurance solvency regulation.^[15]
   In response, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)
   adopted several model reforms for state insurance regulation, including
   risk-based capital requirements, financial regulation accreditation
   standards and an initiative to codify accounting principles. As more
   and more states enacted versions of these model reforms into law, the
   pressure for federal reform of insurance regulation waned.^[16]

   The NAIC acts as a forum for the creation of model laws and
   regulations. Each state decides whether to pass each NAIC model law or
   regulation, and each state may make changes in the enactment process,
   but the models are widely, albeit somewhat irregularly, adopted. The
   NAIC also acts at the national level to advance laws and policies
   supported by state insurance regulators. NAIC model acts and
   regulations provide some degree of uniformity between states, but these
   models do not have the force of law and have no effect unless they are
   adopted by a state. They are, however, used as guides by most states,
   and some states adopt them with little or no change.^[17]

Federal regulation of insurance[edit]

   Nevertheless, federal regulation has continued to encroach upon the
   state regulatory system.^[15] The idea of an optional federal charter
   was first raised after a spate of solvency and capacity issues plagued
   property and casualty insurers in the 1970s. This OFC concept was to
   establish an elective federal regulatory scheme that insurers could opt
   into from the traditional state system, somewhat analogous to the
   dual-charter regulation of banks. Although the optional federal
   chartering proposal was defeated in the 1970s, it became the precursor
   for a modern debate over optional federal chartering in the last
   decade.^[18]

   In 1979 and the early 1980s the Federal Trade Commission attempted to
   regulate the insurance industry, but the Senate Commerce Committee
   voted unanimously to prohibit the FTC's efforts. President Jimmy Carter
   attempted to create an "Office of Insurance Analysis" in the Treasury
   Department, but the idea was abandoned under industry pressure.^[19]

   Over the past two decades, renewed calls for optional federal
   regulation of insurance companies have sounded, including the
   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, the proposed National Insurance Act in
   2006 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010.^[15]

   In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
   Protection Act which is touted by some as the most sweeping financial
   regulation overhaul since the Great Depression. The Dodd-Frank Act has
   significant implications for the insurance industry. Significantly,
   Title V of created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) in the Department
   of the Treasury. The FIO is authorized to monitor all aspects of the
   insurance industry and identify any gaps in the state-based regulatory
   system. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Financial Stability
   Oversight Council (FSOC), which is charged with monitoring the
   financial services markets, including the insurance industry, to
   identify potential risks to the financial stability of the United
   States.^[15]^[20]^[21]

Organization[edit]

Admitted v. surplus[edit]

   An important artifact of the state-based insurance regulation system in
   the United States is the dichotomy between admitted and surplus
   insurers. Insurers in the U.S. may be "admitted," meaning that they
   have been formally admitted to a state's insurance market by the state
   insurance commissioner, and are subject to various state laws governing
   organization, capitalization, policy forms, and claims handling. Or
   they may be "surplus," meaning that they are nonadmitted in a
   particular state but are willing to write coverage there. Surplus line
   insurers are supposed to underwrite only very unusual or
   difficult-to-insure risks. Although experienced insurance brokers are
   well aware of what risks an admitted insurer will not accept, they must
   document a ritual of actually shopping around a risk to several
   admitted insurers (who will reject it, of course) before applying for
   coverage with a surplus line insurer.

   To relieve insurers and brokers of that tedious and time-consuming
   chore, many states (with the notable exception of Texas) now maintain
   "export lists" of risks that the state insurance commissioner has
   already identified as having no coverage available whatsoever from any
   admitted insurer in the state. In turn, brokers presented by clients
   with those risks can immediately "export" them to the out-of-state
   surplus market and apply directly to surplus line insurers without
   having to first document multiple attempts to present the risk to
   admitted insurers.

   By their very nature, export lists illustrate what U.S. insurers
   consider to be hard-to-insure risks. For example, the California export
   list includes ambulance services, amusement parks, fireworks displays,
   moving a building, hot air balloons, product recalls, sawmills and
   security guards, as well as particular types of insurance like
   employment practices liability and kidnap and ransom.^[22]

   Although surplus line insurers are still regulated by the states in
   which they are actually admitted, the disadvantages of obtaining
   insurance from a surplus line insurer are that the policy will usually
   be written on a nonstandard form (that is, not from the Insurance
   Services Office), and if the insurer collapses, its insureds in states
   in which it is nonadmitted will not enjoy certain types of protection
   available to insureds in states in which the insurer is admitted.
   However, for persons trying to obtain coverage for unusual risks, the
   choice is usually between a surplus line insurer or no coverage at all.

Insurance groups[edit]

   Only the smallest insurers exist as a single corporation. Most major
   insurance companies actually exist as insurance groups. That is, they
   consist of holding companies which own several admitted and surplus
   insurers (and sometimes a few excess insurers and reinsurers as well).
   There are dramatic variations from one insurance group to the next in
   terms of how its various business functions are divided up among its
   subsidiaries or outsourced to third party corporations altogether. All
   major insurance groups in the U.S. that transact insurance in
   California maintain a publicly accessible list on their Web sites of
   the actual insurer entities within the group, as required by California
   Insurance Code Section 702.

   An example of how insurance groups work is that when people call GEICO
   and ask for a rate quote, they are actually speaking to GEICO Insurance
   Agency, which may then write a policy from any one of GEICO's seven
   insurance companies. When the customer writes their check for the
   premium to "GEICO," the premium is actually deposited with one of those
   seven insurance companies (the one that actually wrote their policy).
   Similarly, any claims against the policy are charged to the issuing
   company. But as far as most layperson customers know, they are simply
   dealing with GEICO.

   Obviously, it is more difficult to operate an insurance group than a
   single insurance company, since employees must be painstakingly trained
   to observe corporate formalities so that courts will not treat the
   entities in the group as alter egos of each other. For example, all
   insurance policies and all claim-related documents must consistently
   reference the relevant company within the group, and the flows of
   premiums and claim payments must be carefully recorded against the
   books of the correct company.

   The advantage of the insurance group system is that a group has
   increased survivability over the long run than a single insurance
   company. If any one company in the group is hit with too many claims
   and fails, the company can be quietly placed into "runoff" (in which it
   continues to exist only to process remaining claims and no longer
   writes new coverage) but the rest of the group continues to operate.

   By way of contrast, when small insurers fail, they tend to do so in a
   rather wild and spectacular fashion. Sometimes the result may be a
   state-supervised takeover by which a state agency may have to assume
   part of their residual liabilities.

Institutions[edit]

   Various associations, government agencies, and companies serve the
   insurance industry in the United States. The National Association of
   Insurance Commissioners provides models for standard state insurance
   law, and provides services for its members, which are the state
   insurance divisions. Many insurance providers use the Insurance
   Services Office, which produces standard policy forms and rating loss
   costs and then submits these documents on the behalf of member insurers
   to the state insurance divisions.

Definition[edit]

   In recent years this kind of operational definition proved inadequate
   as a result of contracts that had the form but not the substance of
   insurance. The essence of insurance is the transfer of risk from the
   insured to one or more insurers. How much risk a contract actually
   transfers proved to be at the heart of the controversy. This issue
   arose most clearly in reinsurance, where the use of Financial
   Reinsurance to reengineer insurer balance sheets under US GAAP became
   fashionable during the 1980s. The accounting profession raised serious
   concerns about the use of reinsurance in which little if any actual
   risk was transferred, and went on to address the issue in FAS 113,
   cited above. While on its face, FAS 113 is limited to accounting for
   reinsurance transactions, the guidance it contains is generally
   conceded to be equally applicable to US GAAP accounting for insurance
   transactions executed by commercial enterprises.

Risk transfer requirement[edit]

   FAS 113 contains two tests, called the '9a and 9b tests,' that
   collectively require that a contract create a reasonable chance of a
   significant loss to the underwriter for it to be considered insurance.

     9. Indemnification of the ceding enterprise against loss or
     liability relating to insurance risk in reinsurance of
     short-duration contracts requires both of the following, unless the
     condition in paragraph 11 is met:

     a. The reinsurer assumes significant insurance risk under the
     reinsured portions of the underlying insurance contracts.

     b. It is reasonably possible that the reinsurer may realize a
     significant loss from the transaction.

   Paragraph 10 of FAS 113 makes clear that the 9a and 9b tests are based
   on comparing the present value of all costs to the PV of all income
   streams. FAS gives no guidance on the choice of a discount rate on
   which to base such a calculation, other than to say that all outcomes
   tested should use the same rate.

   Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles ("SSAP") 62, issued by the
   National Association of Insurance Commissioners, applies to so-called
   'statutory accounting' - the accounting for insurance enterprises to
   conform with regulation. Paragraph 12 of SSAP 62 is nearly identical to
   the FAS 113 test, while paragraph 14, which is otherwise very similar
   to paragraph 10 of FAS 113, additionally contains a justification for
   the use of a single fixed rate for discounting purposes. The choice of
   an "reasonable and appropriate" discount rate is left as a matter of
   judgment.

No brightline test[edit]

   Neither FAS 113 nor SAP 62 defines the terms reasonable or significant.
   Ideally, one would like to be able to substitute values for both terms.
   It would be much simpler if one could apply a test of an X percent
   chance of a loss of Y percent or greater. Such tests have been
   proposed, including one famously attributed to an SEC official who is
   said to have opined in an after lunch talk that at least a 10 percent
   chance of at least a 10 percent loss was sufficient to establish both
   reasonableness and significance. Indeed, many insurers and reinsurers
   still apply this "10/10" test as a benchmark for risk transfer testing.

   An attempt to use any numerical rule such as the 10/10 test will
   quickly run into problems. Suppose a contract has a 1 percent chance of
   a 10,000 percent loss? It should be reasonably self-evident that such a
   contract is insurance, but it fails one half of the 10/10 test.

   Excess of loss contracts, like those commonly used for umbrella and
   general liability insurance, or to insure against property losses, will
   typically have a low ratio of premium paid to maximum loss recoverable.
   This ratio (expressed as a percentage), commonly called the "rate on
   line" for historical reasons related to underwriting practices at
   Lloyd's of London, will typically be low for contracts that contain
   reasonably self-evident risk transfer. As the ratio increases to
   approximate the present value of the limit of coverage, self-evidence
   decreases and disappears.

   Contracts with low rates on line may survive modest features that limit
   the amount of risk transferred. As rates on line increase, such risk
   limiting features become increasingly important.

"Safe harbor" exemptions[edit]

   The analysis of reasonableness and significance is an estimate of the
   probability of different gain or loss outcomes under different loss
   scenarios. It takes time and resources to perform the analysis, which
   constitutes a burden without value where risk transfer is reasonably
   self-evident.

   Guidance exists for insurers and reinsurers, whose CEO's and CFO's
   attest annually as to the reinsurance agreements their firms undertake.
   The American Academy of Actuaries, for instance, identifies three
   categories of contract as outside the requirement of attestation:
     * Inactive contracts. If there are no premiums due nor losses
       payable, and the insurer is not taking any credit for the
       reinsurance, determining risk transfer is irrelevant.
     * Pre-1994 contracts. The attestation requirement only applies to
       contracts that were entered into, renewed or amended on or after 1
       January 1994. Prior contracts need not be analyzed.
     * Where risk transfer is "reasonably self-evident."

   “ Risk transfer is reasonably self-evident in most traditional per-risk
     or per-occurrence excess of loss reinsurance contracts. For these
     contracts, a predetermined amount of premium is paid and the reinsurer
     assumes nearly all or all of the potential variability in the
     underlying losses, and it is evident from reading the basic terms of
     the contract that the reinsurer can incur a significant loss. In many
     cases, there is no aggregate limit on the reinsurer's loss. The
     existence of certain experience-based contract terms, such as
     experience accounts, profit commissions, and additional premiums,
     generally reduce the amount of risk transfer and make it less likely
     that risk transfer is reasonably self-evident.                         ”

   —American Academy of Actuaries^[23]

Risk limiting features[edit]

   An insurance policy should not contain provisions that allow one side
   or the other to unilaterally void the contract in exchange for benefit.
   Provisions that void the contract for failure to perform or for fraud
   or material misrepresentation are ordinary and acceptable.

   The policy should have a term of not more than about three years. This
   is not a hard and fast rule. Contracts of over five years duration are
   classified as ‘long-term,’ which can impact the accounting treatment,
   and can obviously introduce the possibility that over the entire term
   of the contract, no actual risk will transfer. The coverage provided by
   the contract need not cease at the end of the term (e.g., the contract
   can cover occurrences as opposed to claims made or claims paid).

   The contract should be considered to include any other agreements,
   written or oral, that confer rights, create obligations, or create
   benefits on the part of either or both parties. Ideally, the contract
   should contain an ‘Entire Agreement’ clause that assures there are no
   undisclosed written or oral side agreements that confer rights, create
   obligations, or create benefits on the part of either or both parties.
   If such rights, obligations or benefits exist, they must be factored
   into the tests of reasonableness and significance.

   The contract should not contain arbitrary limitations on timing of
   payments. Provisions that assure both parties of time to properly
   present and consider claims are acceptable provided they are
   commercially reasonable and customary.

   Provisions that expressly create actual or notional accounts that
   accrue actual or notional interest suggest that the contract contains,
   in fact, a deposit.

   Provisions for additional or return premium do not, in and of
   themselves, render a contract something other than insurance. However,
   it should be unlikely that either a return or additional premium
   provision be triggered, and neither party should have discretion
   regarding the timing of such triggering.

   All of the events that would give rise to claims under the contract
   cannot have materialized prior to the inception of the contract. If
   this "all events" test is not met, then the contract is considered to
   be a retroactive contract, for which the accounting treatment becomes
   complex.
