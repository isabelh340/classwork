   The Constitutional Convention^[1]^:31 (also known as the Philadelphia
   Convention,^[1]^:31 the Federal Convention,^[1]^:31 or the Grand
   Convention at Philadelphia) took place from May 25 to September 17,
   1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to address problems in governing
   the United States of America, which had been operating under the
   Articles of Confederation following independence from Great Britain.
   Although the Convention was intended to revise the Articles of
   Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its proponents,
   chief among them James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, was to create a
   new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected
   George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the
   Convention was the creation of the United States Constitution, placing
   the Convention among the most significant events in the history of the
   United States.

   The most contentious disputes revolved around the composition and
   election of the Senate, how "proportional representation" was to be
   defined (whether to include slaves or other property), whether to
   divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power
   into a single president, how to elect the president, how long his term
   was to be and whether he could stand for reelection, what offenses
   should be impeachable, the nature of a fugitive slave clause, whether
   to allow the abolition of the slave trade, and whether judges should be
   chosen by the legislature or executive. Most of the time during the
   Convention was spent on deciding these issues, while the powers of
   legislature, executive, and judiciary were not heavily disputed. Once
   the Convention began, the delegates first agreed on the principles of
   the Convention, then they agreed on Madison's Virginia Plan and began
   to modify it. A Committee of Detail assembled during the July 4 recess
   and produced a rough draft. Most of this rough draft remained in place,
   and can be found in the final version of the constitution. After the
   final issues were resolved, the Committee on Style produced the final
   version, and it was voted on and sent to the states.

Historical context[edit]

   Before the Constitution was drafted, the nearly 4 million
   inhabitants^[2] of the 13 newly independent states were governed under
   the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental
   Congress. It soon became evident to nearly all that the chronically
   underfunded Confederation government, as originally organized, was
   inadequate for managing the various conflicts that arose among the
   states.^[3]^:4–5^[4]^:14–16 As the Articles of Confederation could only
   be amended by unanimous vote of the states, any state had effective
   veto power over any proposed change.^[5] In addition, the Articles gave
   the weak federal government no taxing power: it was wholly dependent on
   the states for its money, and had no power to force delinquent states
   to pay.^[6]

   Once the immediate task of winning the American Revolutionary War had
   passed, the states began to look to their own interests, and disputes
   arose. These included a dispute between Maryland and Virginia over the
   Potomac River and opposition to Rhode Island's imposing taxes on all
   traffic passing through it on the post road that linked all the states.
   James Madison suggested that state governments should appoint
   commissioners "to take into consideration the trade of the United
   States; to examine the relative situation and trade of said states; to
   consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may
   be necessary to their common interests and permanent harmony".^[7]^:92

   In September 1786, at the Annapolis Convention, delegates from five
   states called for a constitutional convention in order to discuss
   possible improvements to the Articles of Confederation. The
   Constitutional convention took place in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787.
   Rhode Island, fearing that the Convention would work to its
   disadvantage, boycotted the Convention and, when the Constitution was
   put to the states, initially refused to ratify it.^[8]

The Convention[edit]

   Independence Hall's Assembly Room

   Due to the difficulty of travel in the late 18th century, very few of
   the selected delegates were present on the designated day of May 14,
   1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was
   secured. (New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until
   more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.)^[3]^:103 James
   Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation
   arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation
   produced the Virginia Plan, which was designed and written by James
   Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State
   House.

   George Washington was unanimously elected president of the
   Convention,^[9] and it was agreed that the discussions and votes would
   be kept secret until the conclusion of the meeting.^[3]^:11 Although
   William Jackson was elected as secretary, his records were brief and
   included very little detail. Madison's Notes of Debates in the Federal
   Convention of 1787, supplemented by the notes of Robert Yates, remain
   the most complete record of the Convention.^[3]^:162–164 Throughout the
   debate, delegates constantly referred to precedents from history in
   support of their position. Most commonly, they referred to the history
   of England, in particular the Glorious Revolution (often simply called
   "The Revolution"), classical history (mainly the Roman Republic and the
   leagues of Greek city-states), and recent precedents from Holland and
   Germany.

James Madison's blueprint[edit]

   While waiting for the Convention to formally begin, James Madison
   sketched out his initial draft, which became known as the Virginia Plan
   and reflected his views as a strong nationalist.^[4]^:47 By the time
   the rest of the Virginia delegation arrived, most of the Pennsylvania
   delegation had arrived as well. They agreed on Madison's plan, and
   formed what came to be the predominant coalition. By the time the
   Convention started, the only blueprints that had been assembled were
   Madison's Virginia Plan, and Charles Pinckney's plan. As Pinckney
   didn't have a coalition behind his plan, Madison's plan was the
   starting point for deliberations.^[4]^:47
   James Madison, the author of the Virginia Plan

   The Convention agreed on several principles. Most importantly, they
   agreed that the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend
   the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new
   constitution outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the
   Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign
   states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal
   problems were limited.^[4]^:64 Another principle they agreed on was
   that the new government would have all the powers of the Confederation
   Congress, plus additional powers over the states.^[4]^:64 Once agreeing
   on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and
   signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began
   modifying it.

   Madison's plan operated on several assumptions that were not seriously
   challenged. During the deliberations, few raised serious objections to
   the planned bicameral congress, nor the separate executive function,
   nor the separate judicial function.^[4]^:67 As English law had
   typically recognized government as having two separate functions, law
   making embodied in the legislature, and law executing embodied in the
   king and his courts, the division of the legislature from the executive
   and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.^[9]

   The division of the legislature into an upper and lower house wasn't
   questioned either, despite the obscure origins of the English House of
   Lords and its role as the representative of the hereditary
   nobility.^[4]^:82 Americans had seldom known any but bicameral
   legislatures, both in Britain and in most state governments. The main
   exceptions to this were the dysfunctional Confederation Congress and
   the unicameral Pennsylvania legislature, which was seen as quickly
   vacillating between partisan extremes after each election.^[4]^:82
   Experience had convinced the delegates that an upper house was
   necessary to tame the passions of the people. However, since America
   had no native hereditary aristocracy, the character of this upper house
   was uncertain, other than the belief that it should represent the
   "betters" of society.^[4]^:85

   "In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of
   people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An
   agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our
   government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country
   against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the
   government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and
   check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the
   minority of the opulent against the majority. The Senate, therefore,
   ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have
   permanency and stability."
   --James Madison, quoted in Notes of the Secret Debates of the Federal
   Convention of 1787 by Robert Yates

   The delegates also agreed with Madison that the executive function had
   to be independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly
   power, American legislatures had created state governments where the
   executive was beholden to the legislature, and by the late 1780s this
   was widely seen as being a source of paralysis.^[4]^:82 The
   Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.

   Furthermore, in the English tradition, judges were seen as being agents
   of the King and his court, who represented him throughout his
   realm.^[9] Madison believed that in the American states, this direct
   link between state executives and judges was a source of corruption
   through patronage, and thought the link had to be severed between the
   two, thus creating the "third branch" of the judiciary which had been
   without any direct precedent before this point.^[9] Madison, however,
   did not believe that the judiciary should be truly independent, but
   rather beholden to the legislature rather than the executive. At the
   Convention, some sided with Madison that the legislature should choose
   judges, while others believed the president should choose judges. A
   compromise was eventually reached that the president should choose
   judges and the Senate confirm them.^[4]^:84

   In a few areas, Madison's plan included provisions that had little
   support among the delegates. Few agreed with Madison that the
   legislature should be able to invalidate state laws, so the idea was
   dropped. While most thought there should be some mechanism to
   invalidate bad laws by congress, few agreed with Madison that a board
   of the executive and judges should decide on this. Instead, the power
   was given solely to the executive in the form of the veto. Many also
   thought this would be useful to protect the executive, whom many
   worried might become beholden to an imperial legislature.^[4]^:141
   Also, during the deliberations, the New Jersey Plan was introduced,
   although it was more of a protest to the excessive national character
   of the Virginia plan, and was not seriously considered.^[4]^:230 The
   office of Vice President was also included later in the deliberations,
   mainly to provide the president a successor if he was unable to
   complete his term.

The early debate[edit]

   Each state was allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a
   proposal during the debates in accordance with the majority opinion of
   the state's delegates.^[3]^:83 Throughout the Convention, delegates
   would regularly come and go, with only 30 – 40 being present on a
   typical day.^[3]^:83 Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally
   divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the
   state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the
   delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that
   state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote
   on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three
   delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of
   returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at
   the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend
   and occasionally to speak during the debates.^[3]^:83

   "All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first
   are the rich and well born, the other the mass of the people. The voice
   of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however
   generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in
   fact. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or
   determine right. Give therefore to the first class a distinct,
   permanent share in the government. They will check the unsteadiness of
   the second, and as they cannot receive any advantage by a change, they
   therefore will ever maintain good government. Can a democratic
   assembly, who annually revolve in the mass of the people, be supposed
   steadily to pursue the public good? Nothing but a permanent body can
   check the imprudence of democracy. Their turbulent and uncontroling
   disposition requires checks."
   --Alexander Hamilton, quoted in Notes of the Secret Debates of the
   Federal Convention of 1787 by Robert Yates

   The first area of major dispute was the manner by which the lower house
   would be apportioned. A minority wanted it to be apportioned so that
   all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously
   considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture
   of property and population.^[4]^:117 Though there was discussion on how
   to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later
   dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property
   would closely correlate to population.

   Most accepted the desire among the slave states to count slaves as part
   of the population, although their servile status was raised as a major
   objection against this. The Three-Fifths Compromise assessing
   population by adding the number of free persons to three-fifths of "all
   other persons" (slaves) was agreed to without serious dispute.^[4]^:119
   In 1783, when attempting to assess a national taxation system, the
   Confederation Congress had considered a three fifths ratio, which did
   not achieve unanimity.^[10] ^[4]^:119 This compromise resulted in a
   large coalition of states, including the small slave states of South
   Carolina and Georgia, backing the Virginia plan and thus expanding the
   power of the primary coalition. That the lower house was to be elected
   directly by the voters was also accepted without major
   dispute.^[4]^:119
   Front side of the Virginia Plan

   More contentious than the lower house was the question of the upper
   house. Few agreed with Madison that its members should be elected by
   the lower house. James Wilson suggested election by popular vote versus
   election by state legislature, but his proposal was shot down 10-1 by
   the delegates.^[11] Most delegates didn't question the intelligence of
   the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which
   information spread in the late 18th century.^[4]^:122 At the time of
   the Convention, they noted that local newspapers said little of current
   events, and what little they had was sketchy and dated. Local papers
   even said little about the meeting of the Convention.

   Besides the problems of direct election, the new Constitution was seen
   as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were
   elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the
   Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make
   the constitutional change less radical.^[4]^:122 The more difficult
   problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation
   offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each
   state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative
   size of the state's population, while the number of representatives in
   the upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective
   of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in
   the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach
   agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further
   consideration later during the meeting.

   The delegates couldn't agree on whether the executive should be a
   single person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit the power of
   the executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive
   power between three persons. ^[4]^:134 The possible problems of this
   system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would
   probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that the
   proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large
   coalition.^[4]^:134 This issue came up occasionally after the matter
   was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.

   Another issue concerned the election of the president. Few agreed with
   Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There
   was widespread concern with direct election, because information
   diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns
   that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region.
   A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the
   governors of the states.^[4]^:136

   The issue was one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done
   so in the electoral college. At the time, before the formation of
   modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates
   would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral
   college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested
   issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president,
   since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused
   dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this
   would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the
   Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no
   candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state
   delegation would vote as a block, rather than individually.^[4]^:136

   As the Convention was entering its second full month of deliberations,
   it was decided that further consideration of the prickly question of
   how to apportion representatives in the national legislature should be
   referred to a committee composed of one delegate from each of the
   eleven states that were present at that time at the Convention. The
   members of this "Grand Committee," as it has come to be known, included
   Elbridge Gerry, Oliver Ellsworth, Robert Yates, William Paterson,
   Gunning Bedford, George Mason, William Davie, John Rutledge, Abraham
   Baldwin, and Benjamin Franklin. In its report to the Convention on July
   5, the committee offered a compromise. The large states had opposed the
   Connecticut Compromise, because they felt it gave too much power to the
   smaller states. The Grand Committee's proposal made two important
   modifications. It added the requirement that revenue bills originate in
   the lower house and not be subject to modification by the upper house
   (although this Origination Clause would later be modified so that
   revenue bills could be amended in the upper house, or Senate).^[4]^:199

   The proposal also specified that each senator was to get "one vote",
   rather than each state delegation, and that each state would have
   multiple senators. This meant that the senators would each be voting
   individually, rather than as a block by state as delegates always had.
   This made senators free agents, presumably acting on behalf of their
   state at large, rather than as mere agents of the state legislatures.
   As such, the Senate would bring a federal character to the government,
   not because senators were elected by state legislatures, but because
   each state was equally represented in the Senate, which was the main
   aim of the smaller states. It was this, not simply Madison's earlier
   agreement to replace the word "national" in the constitution with the
   word "federal", that convinced the delegates that the Constitution had
   a federal character. The final document was thus a mixture of Madison's
   original "national" constitution and the desired "federal" Constitution
   that many of the delegates sought.^[4]^:199

The first draft[edit]

   The Convention adjourned from July 26 to August 6 to await the report
   of the Committee of Detail, which was to produce a first draft of the
   Constitution. It was chaired by John Rutledge (nicknamed “Dictator
   John” as a reflection of the extraordinary power he had assumed as
   South Carolina’s governor during the early days of the
   Revolution),^[4]^:267 with the other members including Edmund Randolph,
   Oliver Ellsworth, James Wilson, and Nathaniel Gorham. Although the
   membership of the committee disproportionately favored the larger
   states,^[4]^:264 it was fairly evenly balanced in terms of geographic
   distribution: Gorham (Massachusetts) representing northern New England,
   Ellsworth (Connecticut) representing lower New England, Wilson
   (Pennsylvania) representing the middle states, Randolph (Virginia)
   representing the upper South, and Rutledge (South Carolina)
   representing the lower South.^[4]^:264^[12]^:164 Other than Gorham, the
   committee members had all been lawyers of distinction, and would be
   leading legal figures in the new government (Randolph would be the
   first attorney general, while Rutledge, Ellsworth and Wilson would
   become Supreme Court justices). They had all known one another as
   delegates to the Confederation Congress, and had seen its weaknesses
   first hand. With the exception of Randolph, they had all been serving
   in the Confederation Congress when its fiscal problems had become
   acute. They also had already played important roles in the Convention:
   Randolph had presented the Virginia Plan, Rutledge and Wilson had been
   key in crafting the compromise on representation, Ellsworth had led the
   small states during the battle over per-state voting in the Senate, and
   Gorham had chaired the Committee of the Whole, where he called for
   compromise during the bitter debate over representation.^[12]^:165–166

   Though the committee did not record minutes of its proceedings, three
   key surviving documents offer clues to the committee’s handiwork: an
   outline by Randolph with edits by Rutledge, extensive notes and a
   second draft by Wilson, also with Rutledge’s edits, and the committee’s
   final report to the Convention.^[12]^:168 From this evidence it is
   thought that the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the
   decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other
   sources, such as the Articles of Confederation, provisions of the state
   constitutions, and even Charles Pinckney's plan, to produce the first
   full draft,^[12]^:165^[4]^:269–270 which author David O. Stewart has
   called a "remarkable copy-and-paste job."^[12]^:165

   Randolph adopted two rules in preparing his initial outline: that the
   Constitution should only include essential principles, avoiding minor
   provisions that would change over time, and that it should be stated in
   simple and precise language.^[4]^:270

   Much of what was included in the committee’s report consisted of
   numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the
   committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be
   challenged; and as such, much of the committee’s proposal would
   ultimately be incorporated into the final version of the Constitution
   without debate.^[12]^:169 Examples of these details included the Speech
   and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for
   comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of
   Representatives and the Senate.

   However, Rutledge, himself a former state governor, was determined that
   while the new national government should be stronger than the
   Confederation government had been, the national government’s power over
   the states should not be limitless; and at Rutledge’s urging, the
   committee went beyond what the Convention had proposed. As Stewart
   describes it, the committee "hijacked" and remade the Constitution,
   altering critical agreements the Convention delegates had already made,
   enhancing the powers of the states at the expense of the national
   government, and adding several far-reaching provisions that the
   Convention had never discussed.^[12]^:165
   John Rutledge, a judge and former governor of South Carolina, chaired
   the committee that wrote the first draft of the Constitution. He argued
   for a federal government of limited power.

   The first major change, insisted on by Rutledge, was meant to sharply
   curtail the essentially unlimited powers to legislate “in all cases for
   the general interests of the Union” that the Convention only two weeks
   earlier had agreed to grant the Congress. Rutledge and Randolph worried
   that the broad powers implied in the language agreed on by the
   Convention would have given the national government too much power at
   the expense of the states. In Randolph’s outline the committee replaced
   that language with a list of 18 specific “enumerated” powers, many
   adopted from the Articles of Confederation, that would strictly limit
   the Congress’ authority to measures such as imposing taxes, making
   treaties, going to war, and establishing post
   offices.^[12]^:170–171^[4]^:273–274 Rutledge, however, was not able to
   completely convince all of the members of the committee to accept the
   change. Over the course of a series of drafts, a catchall provision
   (the “Necessary and Proper Clause”) was eventually added, most likely
   by Wilson, a nationalist little concerned with the sovereignty of
   individual states, giving the Congress the broad power “to make all
   Laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
   foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in
   the government of the United States, or in any department or officer
   thereof.”^[12]^:171–172^[4]^:274 Another revision of Wilson’s draft
   also placed eight specific limits on the states, such as barring them
   from independently entering into treaties and from printing their own
   money, providing a certain degree of balance to the limits on the
   national government intended by Rutledge’s list of enumerated
   powers.^[12]^:172^[4]^:274–275 In addition, Wilson’s draft modified the
   language of the Supremacy Clause adopted by the Convention, to ensure
   that national law would take precedence over inconsistent state
   laws.^[12]^:172

   These changes set the final balance between the national and state
   governments that would be entered into the final document, as the
   Convention never challenged this dual-sovereignty between nation and
   state that had been fashioned by Rutledge and Wilson.^[12]^:172

   Another set of radical changes introduced by the Committee of Detail
   proved far more contentious when the committee’s report was presented
   to the Convention. On the day the Convention had agreed to appoint the
   committee, Southerner Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina,
   had warned of dire consequences should the committee fail to include
   protections for slavery in the Southern states, or allow for taxing of
   Southern agricultural exports.^[12]^:173^[4]^:269,275 Pinckney and his
   fellow Southern delegates must have been delighted to see that the
   committee had included three provisions that explicitly restricted the
   Congress’ authority in ways favorable to Southern interests. The
   proposed language would bar the Congress from ever interfering with the
   slave trade. It would also prohibit taxation of exports, and would
   require that any legislation concerning regulation of foreign commerce
   through tariffs or quotas (that is, any laws akin to England's
   “Navigation Acts”) pass only with two-thirds majorities of both houses
   of Congress. While much of the rest of the committee’s report would be
   accepted without serious challenge on the Convention floor, these last
   three proposals would provoke outrage from Northern delegates and
   slavery opponents.^[12]^:173–174^[4]^:275

   The final report of the committee, which became the first draft of the
   Constitution, was the first workable constitutional plan, as Madison's
   Virginia Plan had simply been an outline of goals and a broad
   structure. Even after it issued this report, the committee continued to
   meet off and on until early September.

Further modifications and concluding debate[edit]

   Another month of discussion and relatively minor refinement followed,
   during which several attempts were made to alter the Rutledge draft,
   though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications
   for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national
   government from issuing paper money.^[12]^:187 Madison in particular
   wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia
   plan.

   One important change that did make it into the final version included
   the agreement between northern and southern delegates to empower
   Congress to end the slave trade starting in 1808. Southern and northern
   delegates also agreed to strengthen the Fugitive Slave Clause in
   exchange for removing a requirement that two-thirds of Congress agree
   on "navigation acts" (regulations of commerce between states and
   foreign governments). The two-thirds requirement was favored by
   southern delegates, who thought Congress might pass navigation acts
   that would be economically harmful to slaveholders.^[12]^:196

   Once the Convention had finished amending the first draft from the
   Committee of Detail, a new set of unresolved questions were sent to
   several different committees for resolution. The Committee of Detail
   was considering several questions related to habeas corpus, freedom of
   the press, and an executive council to advise the president. Two
   committees addressed questions related to the slave trade and the
   assumption of war debts.

   A new committee was created, the Committee on Postponed Parts, to
   address other questions that had been postponed. Its members, such as
   Madison, were delegates who had shown a greater desire for compromise
   and were chosen for this reason as most in the Convention wanted to
   finish their work and go home.^[12]^:207 The committee dealt with
   questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights,
   relations with Indian tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require
   money bills to originate in the House. The biggest issue they addressed
   was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison
   with the committee's input.^[12]^:209 They adopted Wilson's earlier
   plan for choosing the president by an electoral college, and settled on
   the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral
   college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be "nineteen
   times out of twenty".

   The committee also shortened the president's term from seven years to
   four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial
   term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They
   also created the office of the vice president, whose only roles were to
   succeed a president unable to complete a term of office and to preside
   over the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the
   Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and
   appoint ambassadors.^[12]^:212 One controversial issue throughout much
   of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and
   whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted
   from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress;
   the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral
   college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to
   Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a
   viable option.

   Near the end of the Convention, Gerry, Randolph, and Mason emerged as
   the main force of opposition. Their fears were increased as the
   Convention moved from Madison's vague Virginia Plan to the concrete
   plan of Rutledge's Committee of Detail.^[12]^:235 Some have argued that
   Randolph's attacks on the Constitution were motivated by political
   ambition, in particular his anticipation of possibly facing rival
   Patrick Henry in a future election. The main objection of the three was
   the compromise that would allow Congress to pass "navigation acts" with
   a simple majority in exchange for strengthened slave
   provisions.^[12]^:236 Among their other objections was an opposition to
   the office of vice president.

   Though most of their complaints did not result in changes, a couple
   did. Mason succeeded in adding "high crimes and misdemeanors" to the
   impeachment clause. Gerry also convinced the Convention to include a
   second method for ratification of amendments. The report out of the
   Committee of Detail had included only one mechanism for constitutional
   amendment, in which two-thirds of the states had to ask Congress to
   convene a convention for consideration of amendments. Upon Gerry's
   urging, the Convention added back the Virginia Plan's original method
   whereby Congress would propose amendments that the states would then
   ratify.^[12]^:238 All amendments to the Constitution have been made
   through this latter method.

   Despite their successes, these three dissenters grew increasingly
   unpopular as most other delegates wanted to bring the Convention's
   business to an end and return home. As the Convention was drawing to a
   conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the
   Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an
   objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury
   trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity.
   Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill
   of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry
   agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to
   go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying
   tactic.^[12]^:241

   Few at the time realized how important the issue would become, with the
   absence of a bill of rights becoming the main argument of the
   anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's
   delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and
   that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take
   away rights, so there was no need to include protections of rights.
   Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a
   couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language
   that required spending bills to originate in the House of
   Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the
   Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills
   proposed by the House.^[12]^:243

Drafting and signing[edit]

   Constitution, engraving after a painting by Junius Brutus Stearns^[13]

   Once the final modifications had been made, the Committee of Style and
   Arrangement was appointed "to revise the style of and arrange the
   articles which had been agreed to by the house." Unlike other
   committees, whose members were named so the committees included members
   from different regions, this final committee included no champions of
   the small states. Its members were mostly in favor of a strong national
   government and unsympathetic to calls for states' rights.^[12]^:229–230
   They were William Samuel Johnson (Connecticut), Alexander Hamilton (New
   York), Gouverneur Morris (Pennsylvania), James Madison (Virginia), and
   Rufus King (Massachusetts). On Wednesday, September 12, the report of
   the "committee of style" was ordered printed for the convenience of the
   delegates. For three days, the Convention compared this final version
   with the proceedings of the Convention. The Constitution was then
   ordered engrossed on Saturday, September 15 by Jacob Shallus, and was
   submitted for signing on September 17. It made at least one important
   change to what the Convention had agreed to; King wanted to prevent
   states from interfering in contracts. Although the Convention never
   took up the matter his language was now inserted, creating the contract
   clause.^[12]^:243

   Gouverneur Morris is credited, both now and then, as the chief
   draftsman of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not
   all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before
   the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund
   Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of
   Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to
   support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights was not included in the
   Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states
   ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights
   would soon follow.^[14] Shortly before the document was to be signed,
   Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from
   40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier,
   and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his
   only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in
   supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate.
   Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether
   the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than
   150 years.^[12]^:112 Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended
   up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their
   views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said,

     "I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I
     do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve
     them. ... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain,
     may be able to make a better Constitution. ... It therefore
     astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to
     perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our
     enemies...^[15]"

   Rhode Island never sent delegates, and two of New York's three
   delegates did not stay at the Convention for long. Therefore, as George
   Washington stated, the document was executed by "eleven states, and
   Colonel Hamilton".^[12]^:244 Washington signed the document first, and
   then moving by state delegation from north to south, as had been the
   custom throughout the Convention, the delegates filed to the front of
   the room to sign their names. As the final delegates were signing the
   document, Franklin commented on the painting of a sun behind
   Washington's chair at the front of the room. He said he often looked at
   the painting, "without being able to tell, whether it was rising or
   setting. But now at length, I have the happiness to know it is a
   rising, and not a setting sun.^[16]" The Constitution was then
   submitted to the states for ratification, pursuant to its own Article
   VII.^[17]

Proposed plans[edit]

   A diagram of the current situation with House seats shown grouped by
   state illustrates the fundamental concern regarding fairness in voting
   (as it stands today, the largest state has more votes than 21 of the
   smallest states combined).

   Several plans were introduced, with the most important plan being that
   of James Madison (the Virginia Plan). The Convention's work was mostly
   a matter of modifying this plan. Charles Pinckney also introduced a
   plan, although this wasn't considered and its exact character has been
   lost to history. After the Convention was well under way, the New
   Jersey Plan was introduced though never seriously considered.^[4]^:230
   It was mainly a protest to what some delegates thought was the
   excessively radical change from the Articles of Confederation.^[4]^:230
   Alexander Hamilton also offered a plan after the Convention was well
   under way, though it included an executive serving for life and
   therefore the delegates felt it too closely resembled a
   monarchy.^[4]^:137 Historians are unsure how serious he was about this,
   and some have speculated that he may have done it to make Madison's
   plan look moderate by comparison.^[4]^:137 The Connecticut Compromise
   wasn't a plan but one of several compromises offered by the Connecticut
   delegation. It was key to the ultimate ratification of the
   constitution, although was only included after being modified by
   Benjamin Franklin in order to make it more appealing to larger
   states.^[4]^:199

Virginia Plan[edit]

   Main article: Virginia Plan
   The Virginia Plan

   Prior to the start of the Convention, the Virginian delegates met and,
   drawing largely from Madison's suggestions, came up with what came to
   be known as the Virginia Plan, also known as the Large State Plan.^[18]
   For this reason, James Madison is sometimes called the Father of the
   Constitution.^[18] Presented by Virginia governor Edmund Randolph on
   May 29, 1787, the Virginia Plan proposed a very powerful bicameral
   legislature.^[18] Both houses of the legislature would be determined
   proportionately.^[18] The lower house would be elected by the people,
   and the upper house would be elected by the lower house.^[18] The
   executive would exist solely to ensure that the will of the legislature
   was carried out and would therefore be selected by the
   legislature.^[18] The Virginia Plan also created a judiciary, and gave
   both the executive and some of the judiciary the power to veto, subject
   to override.

Plan of Charles Pinckney[edit]

   The Pinckney Plan

   Immediately after Randolph finished laying out the Virginia Plan,
   Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the
   Convention. As Pinckney did not reduce it to writing, the only evidence
   we have are Madison's notes,^[19] so the details are somewhat vague. It
   was a confederation, or treaty, among the 13 states. There was to be a
   bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The
   House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The
   House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years
   and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint
   session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the
   cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal
   of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide
   for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not
   debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of
   Detail.^[20]

New Jersey Plan[edit]

   Main article: New Jersey Plan
   The New Jersey Plan

   After the Virginia Plan was introduced, New Jersey delegate William
   Paterson asked for an adjournment to contemplate the Plan.^[18] Under
   the Articles of Confederation, each state had equal representation in
   Congress, exercising one vote each.^[18] The Virginia Plan threatened
   to limit the smaller states' power by making both houses of the
   legislature proportionate to population. On 14 and 15 June 1787, a
   small-state caucus met to create a response to the Virginia Plan. The
   result was the New Jersey Plan, otherwise known as the Small State
   Plan.^[18]

   Paterson's New Jersey Plan was ultimately a rebuttal to the Virginia
   Plan, and was much closer to the initial call for the Convention:
   drafting amendments to the Articles of Confederation to fix the
   problems in it.^[18] Under the New Jersey Plan, the existing
   Continental Congress would remain, but it would be granted new powers,
   such as the power to levy taxes and force their collection.^[18] An
   executive branch was created, to be elected by Congress (the plan
   allowed for a multi-person executive).^[18] The executives would serve
   a single term and were subject to recall on the request of state
   governors.^[18] The plan also created a judiciary that would serve for
   life, to be appointed by the executives.^[18] Lastly, any laws set by
   Congress would take precedence over state laws.^[18] When Paterson
   reported the plan to the Convention on June 15, 1787, it was ultimately
   rejected, but it gave the smaller states a rallying point for their
   interests.^[18]

Hamilton's Plan[edit]

   The Hamilton Plan

   Unsatisfied with the New Jersey Plan and the Virginia Plan, Alexander
   Hamilton proposed his own plan. It also was known as the British Plan,
   because of its resemblance to the British system of strong centralized
   government.^[18] In his plan, Hamilton advocated virtually doing away
   with state sovereignty and consolidating the states into a single
   nation.^[18] The plan featured a bicameral legislature, the lower house
   elected by the people for three years. The upper house would be elected
   by electors chosen by the people and would serve for life.^[18] The
   plan also gave the Governor, an executive elected by electors for a
   life-term of service, an absolute veto over bills.^[18] State governors
   would be appointed by the national legislature,^[18] and the national
   legislature had veto power over any state legislation.^[18]

   Hamilton presented his plan to the Convention on June 18, 1787.^[18]
   The plan was perceived as a well-thought-out plan, but it was not
   considered, because it resembled the British system too closely.^[18]
   It also contemplated the loss of most state authority, which the states
   were unwilling to allow.

Connecticut Compromise[edit]

   Main article: Connecticut Compromise

   The Connecticut Compromise, forged by Roger Sherman from Connecticut,
   was proposed on June 11.^[18] In a sense it blended the Virginia
   (large-state) and New Jersey (small-state) proposals. Ultimately,
   however, its main contribution was in determining the apportionment of
   the Senate, and thus retaining a federal character in the constitution.
   Sherman sided with the two-house national legislature of the Virginia
   Plan, but proposed "That the proportion of suffrage in the 1st. branch
   [house] should be according to the respective numbers of free
   inhabitants; and that in the second branch or Senate, each State should
   have one vote and no more."^[18] This plan failed at first, but on July
   23 the question was finally settled.^[18]

   What was ultimately included in the constitution was a modified form of
   this plan. In the Committee of Detail, Benjamin Franklin added the
   requirement that revenue bills originate in the house, and rather than
   the state delegations voting as a block as instructed by their state
   legislatures, Franklin's modification made them free agents.^[4]^:199
   As such, the Senate would bring a federal character to the government,
   not because senators were elected by state legislatures, but because
   each state was equally represented.^[4]^:199

Slavery[edit]

   Among the most controversial issues confronting the delegates was that
   of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states at the time of the
   Convention.^[12]^:68 Twenty-five of the Convention's 55 delegates owned
   slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South
   Carolina.^[12]^:68–69 Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the
   population of the states;^[21]^:139 and apart from northernmost New
   England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived
   throughout all regions of the country.^[21]^:132 The majority of the
   slaves (more than 90%),^[21]^:132 however, lived in the South, where
   approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and
   wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2
   families).^[21]^:135 The entire agrarian economy of the South was based
   on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were
   unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the
   institution.
   Quaker John Dickinson argued forcefully against slavery during the
   Convention. Once Delaware's largest slaveholder, he had freed all of
   his slaves by 1787.

   Whether slavery was to be regulated under the new Constitution was a
   matter of such intense conflict between the North and South that
   several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not
   to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in
   their demands that slavery practiced within the confines of the new
   nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that
   the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the
   international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves
   from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention
   postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade
   until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of
   the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of
   Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government
   from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing
   taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree
   on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so
   they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further
   discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would
   have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for
   another 20 years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this
   concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce
   would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave
   trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for
   passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of
   Congress to simple majorities.^[4]^:318–329

   Another contentious slavery-related question was whether slaves would
   be counted as part of the population in determining representation of
   the states in the Congress, or would instead be considered property and
   as such not be considered for purposes of representation.^[22]
   Delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that
   slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, but
   as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on
   the basis of population.^[22] Delegates from states where slavery had
   become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not
   in determining representation.^[22]

   Finally, delegate James Wilson proposed the Three-Fifths
   Compromise.^[18] This was eventually adopted by the Convention.

Delegates[edit]

   The states had originally appointed 70 representatives to the
   Convention, but a number of the appointees did not accept or could not
   attend, leaving 55 delegates who would ultimately craft the
   Constitution.^[23]

   Almost all of the 55 delegates had taken part in the Revolution, with
   at least 29 having served in the Continental forces, most in positions
   of command.^[24] All but two or three had served in colonial or state
   government during their careers.^[4]^:65 The vast majority (about 75%)
   of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation
   Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during
   the Revolution.^[12]^:25 Several had been state governors.^[24]^[4]^:65
   Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be
   signatories to all three of the nation’s founding documents: the
   Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the
   Constitution.^[24]

   More than half of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had
   even been judges), although only about a quarter had practiced law as
   their principal means of business. There were also merchants,
   manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two
   or three physicians, a minister, and several small
   farmers.^[24]^[4]^:65–68 Of the 25 who owned slaves, 16 depended on
   slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the
   mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with
   substantial holdings, and most, with the possible exception of Roger
   Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy.^[4]^:66–67
   George Washington and Gouverneur Morris were among the wealthiest men
   in the entire country.^[24]

   (*) Did not sign the final draft of the U.S. Constitution. Randolph,
   Mason, and Gerry were the only three present in Philadelphia at the
   time who refused to sign.

   The names of several prominent Founders are notable for their not
   having participated in the Constitutional Convention. Thomas Jefferson
   was abroad, serving as the minister to France (nonetheless, Jefferson,
   in a letter to John Adams, would describe the delegates approvingly as
   a gathering of “demi-gods”).^[25]^:13） John Adams was in Britain,
   serving as minister to that country, but he wrote home to encourage the
   delegates. Patrick Henry refused to participate because he "smelt a rat
   in Philadelphia, tending toward the monarchy." Also absent were John
   Hancock and Samuel Adams. Many of the states’ older and more
   experienced leaders may have simply been too busy with the local
   affairs of their states to attend the Convention,^[4]^:65 which had
   originally been planned to strengthen the existing Articles of
   Confederation, not to write a constitution for a completely new
   national government.
