       summit of the Island of Hawaiʻi, the State of Hawaiʻi, and the
       entire North Pacific Ocean. Mauna Kea is also the tallest mountain
       on Earth as measured from base to summit. The shield volcano sits
       on the ocean floor at a depth of 5,998 meters (19,678 ft) for a
       total height of 10,203 meters (33,474 ft).

       Challenger Deep, the deepest point of all the Earth's oceans. The
       total elevation rise from the bottom of the Challenger Deep at
       about -10,920 meters (-35,827 feet) to the summit of Mount Lamlam
       at 406 meters (1332 ft) is 11,326 meters (37,159 ft), or 28%
       greater than the elevation of Mount Everest.
