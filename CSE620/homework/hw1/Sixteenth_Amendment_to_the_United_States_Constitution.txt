   The Sixteenth Amendment in the National Archives

   The Sixteenth Amendment (Amendment XVI) to the United States
   Constitution allows the Congress to levy an income tax without
   apportioning it among the states or basing it on the United States
   Census. This amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional
   requirements regarding direct taxes, after income taxes on rents,
   dividends, and interest were ruled to be direct taxes in the court case
   of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (1895). The amendment was
   adopted on February 3, 1913.

Text

     The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes,
     from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the
     several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

Other Constitutional provisions regarding taxes

   Article I, Section 2, Clause 3:

     Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
     several States which may be included within this Union, according to
     their respective Numbers...^[1]

   Article I, Section 8, Clause 1:

     The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties,
     Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common
     Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties,
     Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.

   Article I, Section 9, Clause 4:

     No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in
     proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be
     taken.

   This clause basically refers to a tax on property, such as a tax based
   on the value of land,^[2] as well as a capitation.

Income taxes before the Pollock case

   Until 1913, customs duties (tariffs) and excise taxes were the primary
   sources of federal revenue.^[3] During the War of 1812, Secretary of
   the Treasury A.J. Dallas made the first public proposal for an income
   tax, but it was never implemented.^[4] The Congress did introduce an
   income tax to fund the Civil War through the Revenue Act of 1861.^[5]
   It levied a flat tax of three percent on annual income above $800,
   which was equivalent to $20,999 in today's money.^[6] This act was
   replaced the following year with the Revenue Act of 1862, which levied
   a graduated tax of three to five percent on income above $600 (worth
   $14,174 today^[6]) and specified a termination of income taxation in
   1866. The Civil War income taxes, which expired in 1872, proved to be
   both highly lucrative and drawing mostly from the more industrialized
   states, with New York State, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts generating
   about 60 percent of the total revenue that was collected.^[7] During
   the two decades following the expiration of the Civil War income tax,
   the Greenback movement, the Labor Reform Party, the Populist Party, the
   Democratic Party and many others called for a graduated income tax.^[7]

   The Socialist Labor Party advocated a graduated income tax in 1887.^[8]
   The Populist Party "demand[ed] a graduated income tax" in its 1892
   platform.^[9] The Democratic Party, led by William Jennings Bryan,
   advocated the income tax law passed in 1894,^[10] and proposed an
   income tax in its 1908 platform.^[11]

   Before Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., all income taxes had been
   considered to be indirect taxes imposed without respect to geography,
   unlike direct taxes, that have to be apportioned among the states
   according to population.^[12]^[13]

The Pollock case

   In 1894, an amendment was attached to the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act that
   attempted to impose a federal tax of two percent on incomes over $4,000
   (equal to $109,000 in 2013).^[6] The federal income tax was strongly
   favored in the South, and it was moderately supported in the eastern
   North Central states, but it was strongly opposed in the Far West and
   the Northeastern States (with the exception of New Jersey).^[14] The
   tax was derided as "un-Democratic, inquisitorial, and wrong in
   principle."^[15]

   In Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., the U.S. Supreme Court
   declared certain taxes on incomes — such as those on property under the
   1894 Act — to be unconstitutionally unapportioned direct taxes. The
   Court reasoned that a tax on income from property should be treated as
   a tax on "property by reason of its ownership" and so should be
   required to be apportioned. The reasoning was that taxes on the rents
   from land, the dividends from stocks, and so forth, burdened the
   property generating the income in the same way that a tax on "property
   by reason of its ownership" burdened that property.

   After Pollock, while income taxes on wages (as indirect taxes) were
   still not required to be apportioned by population, taxes on interest,
   dividends, and rental income were required to be apportioned by
   population. The Pollock ruling made the source of the income (e.g.,
   property versus labor, etc.) relevant in determining whether the tax
   imposed on that income was deemed to be "direct" (and thus required to
   be apportioned among the states according to population) or,
   alternatively, "indirect" (and thus required only to be imposed with
   geographical uniformity).^[16]

   Dissenting in Pollock, Justice John Marshall Harlan stated:

     When, therefore, this court adjudges, as it does now adjudge, that
     Congress cannot impose a duty or tax upon personal property, or upon
     income arising either from rents of real estate or from personal
     property, including invested personal property, bonds, stocks, and
     investments of all kinds, except by apportioning the sum to be so
     raised among the States according to population, it practically
     decides that, without an amendment of the Constitution — two-thirds
     of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States
     concurring — such property and incomes can never be made to
     contribute to the support of the national government.^[17]

   Members of Congress responded to Pollock by expressing widespread
   concern that many of the wealthiest Americans had consolidated too much
   economic power.^[18]

Adoption

   On June 16, 1909, President William Howard Taft, in an address to the
   Sixty-first Congress, proposed a two percent federal income tax on
   corporations by way of an excise tax and a constitutional amendment to
   allow the previously enacted income tax.

     Upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and of
     freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who
     own the stock.^[19]^[20]

   An income tax amendment to the Constitution was first proposed by
   Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska. He submitted two proposals, Senate
   Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39. The amendment proposal finally accepted was
   Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich
   of Rhode Island, the Senate majority leader and Finance Committee
   Chairman.^[21]

   On July 12, 1909, the resolution proposing the Sixteenth Amendment was
   passed by the Congress^[22] and was submitted to the state
   legislatures. Support for the income tax was strongest in the western
   and southern states and opposition was strongest in the northeastern
   states.^[23] Supporters of the income tax believed that it would be a
   much better method of gathering revenue than tariffs, which were the
   primary source of revenue at the time. From well before 1894,
   Democrats, Progressives, Populists and other left-oriented parties
   argued that tariffs disproportionately affected the poor, interfered
   with prices, were unpredictable, and were an intrinsically limited
   source of revenue.^[citation needed] The South and the West tended to
   support income taxes because their residents were generally less
   prosperous, more agricultural and more sensitive to fluctuations in
   commodity prices.^[citation needed] A sharp rise in the cost of living
   between 1897 and 1913 greatly increased support for the idea of income
   taxes, including in the urban Northeast.^[24] A growing number of
   Republicans also began supporting the idea, notably Theodore Roosevelt
   and the "Insurgent" Republicans (who would go on to form the
   Progressive Party).^[25] These Republicans were driven mainly by a fear
   of the increasingly large and sophisticated military forces of Japan,
   Britain and the European powers, their own imperial ambitions and the
   perceived need to defend American merchant ships.^[26] Moreover, these
   progressive Republicans were, as the name suggests, convinced that
   central governments could play a positive role in national
   economies.^[27] A bigger government and a bigger military, of course,
   required a correspondingly larger and steadier source of revenue to
   support it.^[citation needed]

   Opposition to the Sixteenth Amendment was led by establishment
   Republicans because of their close ties to wealthy industrialists,
   although not even they were uniformly opposed to the general idea of a
   permanent income tax. In 1910, New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes,
   shortly before becoming a Supreme Court Justice, spoke out against the
   income tax amendment. While he supported the idea of a federal income
   tax, Hughes believed the words "from whatever source derived" in the
   proposed amendment implied that the federal government would have the
   power to tax state and municipal bonds. He believed this would
   excessively centralize governmental power and "would make it impossible
   for the state to keep any property".^[28]

   Between 1909 and 1913, several conditions favored passage of the
   Sixteenth Amendment. Inflation was high and many blamed federal tariffs
   for the rising prices. The Republican Party was divided and weakened by
   the loss of Roosevelt and the Insurgents who joined the Progressive
   party, a problem that blunted opposition even in the Northeast.^[29]
   The Democrats won both houses and the Presidency in 1912 and the
   country was generally in a left-leaning mood, with the Socialist Party
   winning a seat in the House in 1910 and polling six percent of the
   popular presidential vote in 1912.

   Three advocates for a federal income tax ran in the presidential
   election of 1912.^[30] On February 25, 1913, Secretary of State
   Philander Knox proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified by
   three-fourths of the states and so had become part of the
   Constitution.^[31] The Revenue Act of 1913 was enacted shortly
   thereafter.

   According to the United States Government Printing Office, the
   following states ratified the amendment:^[32]
    1. Alabama (August 10, 1909)
    2. Kentucky (February 8, 1910)
    3. South Carolina (February 19, 1910)
    4. Illinois (March 1, 1910)
    5. Mississippi (March 7, 1910)
    6. Oklahoma (March 10, 1910)
    7. Maryland (April 8, 1910)
    8. Georgia (August 3, 1910)
    9. Texas (August 16, 1910)
   10. Ohio (January 19, 1911)
   11. Idaho (January 20, 1911)
   12. Oregon (January 23, 1911)
   13. Washington (January 26, 1911)
   14. Montana (January 27, 1911)
   15. Indiana (January 30, 1911)
   16. California (January 31, 1911)
   17. Nevada (January 31, 1911)
   18. South Dakota (February 1, 1911)
   19. Nebraska (February 9, 1911)
   20. North Carolina (February 11, 1911)
   21. Colorado (February 15, 1911)
   22. North Dakota (February 17, 1911)
   23. Michigan (February 23, 1911)
   24. Iowa (February 24, 1911)
   25. Kansas (March 2, 1911)
   26. Missouri (March 16, 1911)
   27. Maine (March 31, 1911)
   28. Tennessee (April 7, 1911)
   29. Arkansas (April 22, 1911), after having previously rejected the
       amendment
   30. Wisconsin (May 16, 1911)
   31. New York (July 12, 1911)
   32. Arizona (April 3, 1912)
   33. Minnesota (June 11, 1912)
   34. Louisiana (June 28, 1912)
   35. West Virginia (January 31, 1913)
   36. Delaware (February 3, 1913)

   Ratification (by the requisite 36 states) was completed on February 3,
   1913 with the ratification by Delaware. The amendment was subsequently
   ratified by the following states, bringing the total number of
   ratifying states to forty-two of the forty-eight then existing:

          37. New Mexico (February 3, 1913)
          38. Wyoming (February 3, 1913)
          39. New Jersey (February 4, 1913)
          40. Vermont (February 19, 1913)
          41. Massachusetts (March 4, 1913)
          42. New Hampshire (March 7, 1913), after rejecting the amendment
          on March 2, 1911

   The legislatures of the following states rejected the amendment without
   ever subsequently ratifying it:

          Connecticut
          Rhode Island
          Utah
          Virginia^[33]

   The legislatures of the following states never considered the proposed
   amendment:

          Florida
          Pennsylvania

Pollock overruled

   The Sixteenth Amendment removed the precedent set by the Pollock
   decision.^[34]^[35]^[36] That means the Congress may impose taxes on
   income from any source without having to apportion the total dollar
   amount of tax collected from each state according to each state's
   population in relation to the total national population.^[37]

   In Wikoff v. Commissioner, the United States Tax Court said:

     [I]t is immaterial, with respect to Federal income taxes, whether
     the tax is a direct or an indirect tax. Mr. Wikoff [the taxpayer]
     relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &
     Trust Co. [ . . . ] but the effect of that decision has been
     nullified by the enactment of the 16th Amendment.^[38]

   In Abrams v. Commissioner, the Tax Court said:

     Since the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, it is immaterial
     with respect to income taxes, whether the tax is a direct or
     indirect tax. The whole purpose of the Sixteenth Amendment was to
     relieve all income taxes when imposed from [the requirement of]
     apportionment and from [the requirement of] a consideration of the
     source whence the income was derived.^[39]

Case law

   The federal courts' interpretations of the Sixteenth Amendment have
   changed considerably over time and there have been many disputes about
   the applicability of the amendment.

The Brushaber case

   In Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, 240 U.S. 1 (1916), the Supreme
   Court ruled that (1) the Sixteenth Amendment removes the Pollock
   requirement that certain income taxes (such as taxes on income "derived
   from real property" that were the subject of the Pollock decision), be
   apportioned among the states according to population;^[40] (2) the
   federal income tax statute does not violate the Fifth Amendment's
   prohibition against the government taking property without due process
   of law; (3) the federal income tax statute does not violate the Article
   I, Section 8, Clause 1 requirement that excises, also known as indirect
   taxes, be imposed with geographical uniformity.

The Kerbaugh-Empire Co. case

   In Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.S. 170 (1926), the Supreme
   Court, through Justice Pierce Butler, stated:

     It was not the purpose or the effect of that amendment to bring any
     new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had the power
     to tax all incomes. But taxes on incomes from some sources had been
     held to be "direct taxes" within the meaning of the constitutional
     requirement as to apportionment. [citations omitted] The Amendment
     relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in
     that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those
     that are not, and so put on the same basis all incomes "from
     whatever source derived". [citations omitted] "Income" has been
     taken to mean the same thing as used in the Corporation Excise Tax
     of 1909 (36 Stat. 112), in the Sixteenth Amendment, and in the
     various revenue acts subsequently passed. [citations omitted] After
     full consideration, this court declared that income may be defined
     as gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,
     including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital.

The Glenshaw Glass case

   In Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955), the Supreme
   Court laid out what has become the modern understanding of what
   constitutes "gross income" to which the Sixteenth Amendment applies,
   declaring that income taxes could be levied on "accessions to wealth,
   clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion."
   Under this definition, any increase in wealth — whether through wages,
   benefits, bonuses, sale of stock or other property at a profit, bets
   won, lucky finds, awards of punitive damages in a lawsuit, qui tam
   actions — are all within the definition of income, unless the Congress
   makes a specific exemption, as it has for items such as life insurance
   proceeds received by reason of the death of the insured party,^[41]
   gifts, bequests, devises and inheritances,^[42] and certain
   scholarships.^[43]

Income taxation of wages, etc.

   Federal courts have ruled that the Sixteenth Amendment allows a direct
   tax on "wages, salaries, commissions, etc. without apportionment."^[44]

The Penn Mutual case

   Although the Sixteenth Amendment is often cited as the "source" of the
   congressional power to tax incomes, at least one court has reiterated
   the point made in Brushaber and other cases that the Sixteenth
   Amendment itself did not grant the Congress the power to tax incomes, a
   power the Congress had since 1789, but only removed the possible
   requirement that any income tax be apportioned among the states
   according to their respective populations. In Penn Mutual Indemnity,
   the United States Tax Court stated:^[45]

     In dealing with the scope of the taxing power the question has
     sometimes been framed in terms of whether something can be taxed as
     income under the Sixteenth Amendment. This is an inaccurate
     formulation... and has led to much loose thinking on the subject.
     The source of the taxing power is not the Sixteenth Amendment; it is
     Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution.

   The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with
   the Tax Court, stating:^[46]

     It did not take a constitutional amendment to entitle the United
     States to impose an income tax. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust
     Co., 157 U. S. 429, 158 U. S. 601 (1895), only held that a tax on
     the income derived from real or personal property was so close to a
     tax on that property that it could not be imposed without
     apportionment. The Sixteenth Amendment removed that barrier. Indeed,
     the requirement for apportionment is pretty strictly limited to
     taxes on real and personal property and capitation taxes.

     It is not necessary to uphold the validity of the tax imposed by the
     United States that the tax itself bear an accurate label. Indeed,
     the tax upon the distillation of spirits, imposed very early by
     federal authority, now reads and has read in terms of a tax upon the
     spirits themselves, yet the validity of this imposition has been
     upheld for a very great many years.

     It could well be argued that the tax involved here [an income tax]
     is an "excise tax" based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer.
     It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a
     capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned. We do not
     think it profitable, however, to make the label as precise as that
     required under the Food and Drug Act. Congress has the power to
     impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not
     run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful,
     call it what you will.

The Murphy case

   On December 22, 2006, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated^[47] its unanimous
   decision (of August 2006) in Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and
   United States.^[48] In an unrelated matter, the court had also granted
   the government's motion to dismiss Murphy's suit against the "Internal
   Revenue Service." Under federal sovereign immunity, a taxpayer may sue
   the federal government, but not a government agency, officer, or
   employee (with some exceptions). The Court ruled:

     Insofar as the Congress has waived sovereign immunity with respect
     to suits for tax refunds under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1), that
     provision specifically contemplates only actions against the "United
     States". Therefore, we hold the IRS, unlike the United States, may
     not be sued eo nomine in this case.

   An exception to federal sovereign immunity is in the United States Tax
   Court, in which a taxpayer may sue the Commissioner of Internal
   Revenue.^[49] The original three-judge panel then agreed to rehear the
   case itself. In its original decision, the Court had ruled that 26
   U.S.C. § 104(a)(2) was unconstitutional under the Sixteenth Amendment
   to the extent that the statute purported to tax, as income, a recovery
   for a nonphysical personal injury for mental distress and loss of
   reputation not received in lieu of taxable income such as lost wages or
   earnings.

   Because the August 2006 opinion was vacated, the Court of Appeals did
   not hear the case en banc.

   On July 3, 2007, the Court (through the original three-judge panel)
   ruled (1) that the taxpayer's compensation was received on account of a
   nonphysical injury or sickness; (2) that gross income under section 61
   of the Internal Revenue Code^[50] does include compensatory damages for
   nonphysical injuries, even if the award is not an "accession to
   wealth," (3) that the income tax imposed on an award for nonphysical
   injuries is an indirect tax, regardless of whether the recovery is
   restoration of "human capital," and therefore the tax does not violate
   the constitutional requirement of Article I, Section 9, Clause 4, that
   capitations or other direct taxes must be laid among the states only in
   proportion to the population; (4) that the income tax imposed on an
   award for nonphysical injuries does not violate the constitutional
   requirement of Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, that all duties, imposts
   and excises be uniform throughout the United States; (5) that under the
   doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Internal Revenue Service may not be
   sued in its own name.^[51]

   The Court stated that "[a]lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing
   income which is not so in fact,' [ . . . ] it can label a thing income
   and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority,
   which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article I,
   Sections 8 and 9."^[52] The court ruled that Ms. Murphy was not
   entitled to the tax refund she claimed, and that the personal injury
   award she received was "within the reach of the Congressional power to
   tax under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution" – even if the award
   was "not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment".^[53]
   See also the Penn Mutual case cited above.

   On April 21, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the
   decision by the Court of Appeals.^[54]

   13. ^ "Again the situation is aptly illustrated by the various acts
       taxing incomes derived from property of every kind and nature which
       were enacted beginning in 1861, and lasting during what may be
       termed the Civil War period. It is not disputable that these latter
       tax laws were classed under the head of excises, duties, and
       imposts because it was assumed that they were of that character,
       although putting a tax burden on income of every kind, including
       that derived from property real or personal, since they were not
       taxes directly on property because of its ownership.” Brushaber v.
