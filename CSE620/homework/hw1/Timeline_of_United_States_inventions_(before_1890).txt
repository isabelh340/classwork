   Eli Whitney (1765–1825) is best known for inventing the cotton gin in
   October 1793 and patenting it on March 14, 1794;^[1] a key invention of
   the Industrial Revolution that shaped the economy of the antebellum
   South.^[2]

   A timeline of United States inventions (before 1890) encompasses the
   ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a
   historical context, dating from the Colonial Period to the Gilded Age,
   which have been achieved by inventors who are either native-born or
   naturalized citizens of the United States. Copyright protection secures
   a person's right to his or her first-to-invent claim of the original
   invention in question, highlighted in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of
   the United States Constitution, which gives the following enumerated
   power to the United States Congress:
   “ To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
     limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
     respective Writings and Discoveries.                                 ”

   In 1641, the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow
   by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making
   salt.^[3]^[4]^[5] On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed
   the Patent Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 109) into law proclaiming that patents
   were to be authorized for "any useful art, manufacture, engine,
   machine, or device, or any improvement therein not before known or
   used".^[6] On July 31, 1790, Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford, Vermont
   became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted
   a patent for an improved method of "Making Pot and Pearl Ashes".^[7]
   The Patent Act of 1836 (Ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117) further clarified United
   States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where
   patent applications are filed, processed, and granted, contingent upon
   the language and scope of the claimant's invention, for a patent term
   of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years.^[6]
   However, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (URAA) changed the
   patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years, effective for
   patent applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, thus bringing
   United States patent law further into conformity with international
   patent law.^[8] The modern-day provisions of the law applied to
   inventions are laid out in Title 35 of the United States Code (Ch. 950,
   sec. 1, 66 Stat. 792).

   From 1836 to 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
   (USPTO) has granted a total of 7,861,317 patents^[9] relating to
   several well-known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below.

Colonial Period (1500s–1775)[edit]

   1717 Swim fins

     * Swim fins, also known as swim fins, fins, or flippers, are
       blade-shaped extensions worn on feet or hands for use in water.
       They aid movement in aquatic sports such as swimming, surfing, and
       underwater diving. Swim fins are typically made of rubber or
       plastic. Benjamin Franklin invented wooden swim fins in 1717.^[10]
       His original design consisted of 10-inch-long (250 mm) and
       6-inch-wide (150 mm) palettes. Contrary to today's version of
       rubberized swim fins worn on the feet, Franklin's swim fins were
       originally intended for use on a person's hands. Shaped like lily
       pads or an artist's paint palette, they helped attain greater speed
       with each stroke.^[11] Franklin has since been posthumously honored
       by being inducted into the International Swimming Hall of
       Fame.^[12]

   1730 Octant

   Hadley's octant design

   An octant, also called "reflecting quadrant", is a measuring instrument
   used primarily in navigation. It is a type of reflecting instrument
   that uses mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in
   doing so, doubles the angle measured. This allows the instrument to use
   a one-eighth circle arc to measure a quarter circle or quadrant. The
   octant was invented in 1730 by Thomas Godfrey, a glazier in
   Philadelphia, and independently at the same time in England by the
   mathematician John Hadley, who began work on a similar version of the
   octant.^[13] Both men have an equal and legitimate claim to the
   invention of the octant. Originally this instrument was referred to as
   "Hadley's quadrant", after the English inventor. These days it is now
   known as an octant, the name given to it by its American inventor,
   Thomas Godfrey.^[14]

   1742 Franklin stove

   The Franklin Stove, also known as the circulating stove, is a
   metal-lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow,
   providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace. The
   stove became very popular throughout the Thirteen Colonies and
   gradually replaced open fireplaces. The Franklin stove was invented by
   Benjamin Franklin in 1742.^[15]

   1744 Mail order

     * A mail-order catalog is a publication containing a list of general
       merchandise from a company. Those who publish and operate
       mail-order catalogs are referred to as catalogers within the
       industry, who also buy or manufacture goods and then market those
       goods to prospective customers. Mail ordering uses the postal
       system for soliciting and delivering goods. According to The
       National Mail Order Association, Benjamin Franklin invented and
       conceptualized mail order cataloging in 1744.^[16]

   1749 Lightning rod
     * A lightning rod is one component in a lightning protection system.
       In addition to rods placed at regular intervals on the highest
       portions of a structure, a lightning protection system typically
       includes a rooftop network of conductors, multiple conductive paths
       from the roof to the ground, bonding connections to metallic
       objects within the structure and a grounding network. Individual
       lightning rods are sometimes called finials, air terminals or
       strike termination devices. In 1749^[17] or 1750,^[11] the pointed
       lightning rod conductor, also called a "lightning attractor" or
       "Franklin rod", is generally thought to have been conceived when
       Benjamin Franklin came to the conclusion that electricity and
       lightning were identical and of the same.^[17] By building
       lightning rods originally intended to be adorned atop church
       steeples, Franklin set about trying to prove their usefulness of
       shielding people and buildings from lightning. By 1752, Dr.
       Franklin tied the string of his "electrical kite" to an insulating
       silk ribbon for the knuckles of his hand. The kite in turn was
       attached to a metal key. During a storm, witnessed by his son
       William Franklin, Dr. Franklin had finally proven that lightning
       was a form of electricity when the metal key received an electrical
       charge from a bolt of lightning. Thus, the practical use of
       lightning rods, attributed to the inventor Benjamin Franklin, was
       confirmed.^[18]

   1752 Flexible urinary catheter
     * In medicine, a catheter is a tube that can be inserted into a body
       cavity, duct, or vessel. Catheters thereby allow drainage,
       injection of fluids, or access by surgical instruments. Prior to
       the mid 18th-century, catheters were made of wood or stiffened
       animal skins which were not conducive to navigating the anatomical
       curvature of the human urethra. Extending his inventiveness to his
       family's medical problems, Benjamin Franklin invented the flexible
       catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder
       stones. Dr. Franklin's flexible catheter was made of metal with
       segments hinged together in order for a wire enclosed inside to
       increase rigidity during insertion.^[10]^[19]^[20]^[21]

   1761 Armonica
     * Also known as the glass harmonica or glass armonica, Benjamin
       Franklin invented a musical instrument in 1761, an arrangement of
       glasses after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund
       Delaval in Cambridge, England. Dr. Franklin, who called his
       invention the "armonica" after the Italian word for harmony, worked
       with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its
       world première in early 1762, played by Marianne Davies. In this
       version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron
       spindle. The whole spindle turned by means of a foot-operated
       treadle. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls
       with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors
       according to the pitch of the note.^[22]

Independence and the Federalist Era (1776–1801)[edit]

   1776 Swivel chair
     * A swivel or revolving chair is a chair with a single central leg
       that allows the seat to spin around. Swivel chairs can have wheels
       on the base allowing the user to move the chair around their work
       area without getting up. This type is common in modern offices and
       is often also referred to as office chairs. Using an English-style
       Windsor chair of which was possibly made and purchased from Francis
       Trumble or Philadelphia cabinet-maker Benjamin Randolph, Thomas
       Jefferson invented the swivel chair in 1776.^[23] Jefferson heavily
       modified the Windsor chair and incorporated top and bottom parts
       connected by a central iron spindle, enabling the top half known as
       the seat, to swivel on casters of the type used in rope-hung
       windows. When the Second Continental Congress convened in
       Philadelphia, Jefferson's swivel chair is purported to be where he
       drafted the United States Declaration of Independence. Jefferson
       later had the swivel chair sent to his Virginia plantation,
       Monticello, where he later built a "writing paddle" onto its side
       in 1791. Since 1836, the chair has been in the possession of the
       American Philosophical Society located in Philadelphia.^[24]

   1782 Flatboat
     * A flatboat is a rectangular boat with a flat bottom and square ends
       generally used for freight and passengers on inland waterways.
       After serving in the Pennsylvania Line during the American
       Revolutionary War, Jacob Yoder invented and built a large boat at
       the Redstone Old Fort on the Monongahela River, which he freighted
       with flour and carried to New Orleans in May 1782. This was the
       first attempt to navigate the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for
       commercial purposes.^[25]^[26]

   1784 Bifocals
   Bifocals can provide a magnification factor of 10x to read text

   Bifocals are eyeglasses whose corrective lenses contain regions with
   two distinct optical powers. Benjamin Franklin is credited with the
   invention of the first pair of bifocals in the early 1760s, though
   according to the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first indication
   of Dr. Franklin wearing his double spectacles comes from a political
   cartoon printed in 1764. Many publications from that period onward
   refer to Dr. Franklin's double spectacles, including his first
   reference to them in a letter written in Paris, France on August 21,
   1784 that was addressed to his personal friend, English philanthropist
   George Whatley.^[27]^[28]

   1785 Artificial diffraction grating

   In optics, a diffraction grating is an optical component with a regular
   pattern, which diffracts light into several beams. The first man-made
   diffraction grating was invented around 1785 in Philadelphia by David
   Rittenhouse who strung 50 hairs between two finely threaded screws with
   an approximate spacing of about 100 lines per inch.^[29]

   1787 Automatic flour mill

   Classical mill designs were generally powered by water or air. In
   water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water
   flowing, and a water wheel turning. In 1787, American inventor Oliver
   Evans revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first
   fully automatic mill using bucket elevators, screw conveyors, and the
   hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and
   bolting. This was the first time that anyone had conceived and executed
   a system of continuous, fully automatic production.^[26]^[30]

   1792 Cracker
     * A cracker is a type of biscuit that developed from military
       hardtack and nautical ship biscuits. Crackers are now usually eaten
       with soup, or topped with cheese, caviar, or other delicacies. The
       holes in crackers are called "docking" holes as a means to stop air
       pockets from forming in the cracker while baking. Crackers trace
       their origin to the year 1792 when John Pearson of Newburyport,
       Massachusetts invented a cracker-like bread product from just flour
       and water that he called "pilot bread". An immediate success with
       sailors because of its shelf life, it also became distinctly known
       as a hardtack or sea biscuit for long voyages away from home while
       at sea.^[31]

   1793 Cotton gin
     * The cotton gin is a machine that separates cotton fibers from
       seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand.
       These seeds are either used again to grow more cotton or, if badly
       damaged, disposed of. The cotton gin uses a combination of a wire
       screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen,
       while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent
       jams. In 1793, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin and later
       received a patent on March 14, 1794.^[32] Whitney's cotton gin
       could have possibly ignited a revolution in the cotton industry and
       the rise of "King Cotton" as the main cash crop in the South.
       However, it never made him rich. Instead of buying his machine,
       farmers built inferior versions of their own which led to the
       increasing need for African-American slave labor.^[33]

   1795 Wheel cypher
   Jefferson's disk

   The Jefferson disk, or wheel cypher, is a cipher system for encrypting
   messages and used as a deterrent for codebreaking. Using 26 wheels,
   each with the letters of the alphabet arranged randomly around them,
   Thomas Jefferson invented the wheel cypher in 1795. Falling in and out
   of use and obscurity, the wheel cypher was "re-invented" twice: first
   by a French government official around 1890, and then just prior to
   World War I by an officer in the United States Army. Designated as
   M-94, the latter version was used by the United States Army and other
   military services from 1922 to the beginning of World War II.^[34]

   1796 Rumford fireplace

   The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in 1796 when Benjamin
   Thompson Rumford introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening
   to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796,
   when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas
   Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed
   them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted.
   Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the
   hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney
   to increase the speed of air going up the flue. It produced a
   streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into
   the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are
   appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency.
   This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied
   everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The
   Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.^[35]

   1796 Cupcake
   Two cupcakes iced with the Wikipedia logo on their tops

   A cupcake, fairy cake, patty cake or cup cake is a small cake designed
   to serve one person, frequently baked in a small, thin paper or
   aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake
   decorations, such as sprinkles, are common on cupcakes. The earliest
   reference of cupcakes can be traced as far back as 1796, when a recipe
   notation of "a cake to be baked in small cups" was written in American
   Cookery by Amelia Simms.^[36] However, the first use of the term
   "cupcake" was in Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and
   Sweetmeats in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook where it
   referred to the use of a cup for measuring the ingredients.^[37]

   1801 Suspension bridge

   A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck, the
   load-bearing portion, is hung below suspension cables on vertical
   suspenders that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic
   crosses. Primitive in their earliest form, the ancestor to what is now
   considered a suspension bridge, the simple suspension bridge, was
   developed sometime around 2000 BC in China and India, relying upon
   ropes thrown across a narrow gorge or river, from which people could
   hang as they crawled across. With the extreme dangers of swinging back
   and forth, these simple suspension bridges were deemed impractical as
   horses as well as carriages later found it difficult to maneuver across
   their wooden planks.^[38] The world's first suspension bridge in a
   modern sense, the Jacob's Creek Bridge at approximately 70 feet in
   length, was invented by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania in
   1801,^[39] who designed vertical towers to elevate the curved iron
   cables and to stiffen trusses in order to make the deck of bridges
   architecturally sound for passing travelers. Nowadays, suspension
   bridges use steel cables. However, the suspension bridge and its basic,
   fundamental design of which Finley is duly accredited to inventing, is
   still evident today in suspension bridges found throughout the
   world.^[40]

   1801 Fire hydrant
     * A fire hydrant is an active fire protection measure, and a source
       of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with
       municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the
       municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Before
       the existence of fire hydrants, a primitive fire suppression system
       known as "fire plugs" consisted of burying a wooden water pipe
       (often no more than a hollowed out log) along the streets for teams
       of bucket brigades to form and fight fires. Wooden pegs would then
       need to be hammerred over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of
       water.^[41] The invention of a post or pillar type fire hydrant is
       generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the
       Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801.^[26] It had a
       combination hose/faucet outlet and was of "wet barrel" design with
       the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent
       for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified due to the fact
       that the patent office in Washington D.C. was burned to the ground
       in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were
       destroyed in the process.^[42] In 1863, Birdsill Holly invented the
       modern version of the fire hydrant. While Holly was only one of
       many involved in the development of the fire hydrant, innovations
       he introduced are largely responsible for the fire hydrant taken
       for granted today. In 1869, Holly was issued U.S. patent #94749,
       for an "improved fire hydrant".^[41]

Manifest Destiny (1802–1860)[edit]

   1802 Banjo clock
   An example of a banjo clock

   A banjo clock is a wall clock with an inverted banjo-shaped case. The
   banjo clock normally lacks a striking mechanism and indicates time only
   by its hands and dial, for which reason some horologists may insist
   upon calling it a timepiece rather than a true clock. The clock is
   usually adorned with a finial on the top. Known as his "patent
   timepiece", the banjo clock was invented by renowned American
   clockmaker Simon Willard of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and patented on
   February 8, 1802.^[43]^[44]^[45]

   1804 Burr Truss

   The Burr Arch Truss, Burr Truss, or the Burr Arch, is a combination of
   an arch and a multiple kingpost truss design typically implemented in
   the construction of covered bridges. The design principle behind the
   Burr arch truss was that the arch should be capable of holding the
   entire load on the bridge while the truss was used to keep the bridge
   rigid. In 1804, American architect Theodore Burr, a cousin of then Vice
   President of the United States, Aaron Burr, designed and built the
   first Burr Truss on a bridge over the Hudson River in Watertown, New
   York.^[46]

   1805 Amphibious vehicle

   An amphibious vehicle is one which can be used on land or water. The
   self-propelled variant was invented by Oliver Evans who named it the
   "Orukter Amphibolos". Its steam-powered engine drove either wooden
   wheels or a paddle wheel used as a means of transport, on land and in
   water. Evans demonstrated his machine in Philadelphia's Center Square
   in 1805, built on commission from the Philadelphia Board of Health.
   Evans' steam engine differed fundamentally from later models, operating
   at a high pressure, 25 or 30 pounds. Many years later, Evans' invention
   would be sold off for parts. On July 16, 2005, Philadelphia celebrated
   the 200th anniversary of Oliver Evans's Orukter Amphibolos. Many
   historians describe Oliver Evans' invention as the United States' first
   land and water transporter.^[47]

   1805 Vapor-compression refrigeration
   Schematic of Gorrie's 1841 ice machine

   Refrigeration is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space,
   or from a substance, and moving it to a place where it is
   unobjectionable. The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the
   temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining
   that lower temperature. The American inventor Oliver Evans, acclaimed
   as the "father of refrigeration", invented the vapor-compression
   refrigeration machine in 1805. Heat would be removed from the
   environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move
   through a compressor and condenser, where it would eventually revert to
   a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again.
   However, no such refrigeration unit was built by Evans.^[48] In 1834,
   Jacob Perkins modified Evans' original design, building the world's
   first refrigerator and filing the first legal patent for refrigeration
   using vapor-compression.^[49] John Gorrie, an American doctor from
   Florida, invented the first mechanical refrigeration unit in 1841,
   based on Evans' original invention to make ice in order to cool the air
   for yellow fever patients. Gorrie's mechanical refrigeration unit was
   issued a patent in 1851.^[50] American professor Alexander C. Twining
   of Cleveland, Ohio patented an early vapor-compression refrigerator in
   1853 that was fully capable of producing a ton of ice per day.^[51] In
   1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by Fred W.
   Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana with models consisting of a unit that was
   mounted on top of an ice box.^[52] A self-contained refrigerator, with
   a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by Alfred
   Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but
   was bought out by William C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire
   Company in order to begin the first mass-production of
   refrigerators.^[53]

   1806 Coffee percolator

   A coffee percolator is a type of pot used to brew coffee. In the case
   of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the
   coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds
   that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma. In 1806, Benjamin
   Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve
   to strain away the grounds.^[26]^[54]

   1808 Lobster trap
   An example of a lobster trap used in Devon, England

   A lobster trap is a portable trap which traps crustaceans such as
   lobsters or crayfish and is used in the industry of lobster fishing. A
   lobster trap can catch multiple lobsters at once. The lobster trap was
   invented in 1808 by Ebenezer Thorndike of Swampscott,
   Massachusetts.^[26]^[55]

   1812 Columbiad

   The Columbiad was a large caliber, smoothbore, muzzle loading cannon
   able to fire heavy projectiles at both high and low trajectories. This
   feature enabled the columbiad to fire solid shot or shell to long
   ranges, making it an excellent seacoast defense weapon for its day.
   Used as an artillery piece during the War of 1812 by the United States
   against the British, the Columbiad was invented around the year 1812 by
   George Bomford, a colonel in the United States Army.^[56]

   1813 Circular saw

   The circular saw is a metal disc or blade with saw teeth on the edge as
   well as the machine that causes the disk to spin. It may cut wood or
   other materials and may be hand-held or table-mounted. Tabitha Babbitt
   is credited with inventing the first circular saw used in a saw mill in
   1813.^[26]^[57]

   1815 Dental floss
     * Dental floss is either a bundle of thin nylon filaments or a
       plastic ribbon used to remove food and dental plaque from teeth.
       Levi Spear Parmly, a dentist from New Orleans, is credited with
       inventing the first form of dental floss. He had been recommending
       that people should clean their teeth with silk floss since
       1815.^[26]^[58]

   1816 Milling machine
     * A milling machine is a machine tool used for the shaping of metal
       and other solid materials. In contrast to drilling, where the drill
       is moved exclusively along its axis, the milling operation uses
       movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as 'in and out'.
       Simeon North is generally credited for inventing and building the
       earliest, though primitive, milling machine to replace filing
       operations by about 1816 or even earlier.^[59]

   1818 Profile lathe
     * A lathe is an adjustable horizontal metal rail and a tool rest,
       between the material and the operator which accommodates the
       positioning of shaping tools. With wood, it is common practice to
       press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object after
       shaping it to smooth the surface. As the first of its kind, Thomas
       Blanchard of Middlebury, Connecticut, invented the profile lathe in
       1818, intended for the mass duplication of woodworking.^[60]

   1827 Detachable collar
     * A detachable collar is a collar separate from the shirt, fastened
       to the shirt by studs. Hannah Lord Montague invented the detachable
       collar in Troy, New York in 1827, after she snipped the collar off
       one of her husband's shirts to wash it, and then sewed it back
       on.^[61]

   1829 Graham cracker
   A stack of graham crackers

   A graham cracker is cookie or digestive biscuit made with graham flour,
   a combination of fine-ground white flour and coarse-ground wheat bran
   and germ. Graham crackers are often used for making s'mores and pie
   crusts. Graham bread was invented by a Presbyterian minister, Reverend
   Sylvester Graham in 1829, for his vegetarian diet. The Graham bread was
   high in fiber, made with non-sifted whole wheat flour and cut into
   little squares now known as graham crackers.^[62]

   1830 Platform scale

   Also known as the Fairbanks Scale, the platform scale is a benched
   scale for measuring the counterbalance weight of loaded objects at
   ground level, thus eliminating the use of a hoist. After a series of
   trial and error in his designs, Thaddeus Fairbanks patented his
   invention in 1830. E & T Fairbanks & Company, a business partnership
   between Thaddeus and his brother, Erastus Fairbanks, exported their
   famous scales around the world to exotic locations such as England,
   China, Cuba, Russia, and India due to the high demand.^[63]

   1831 Flanged T rail
     * The flanged T rail is an all-iron railway rail that has a flat
       bottom and requires no chair to hold the rails upright. The flanged
       "tee" rail was invented in May 1831 by an American named Robert L.
       Stevens of the Camden & Amboy Railroad and Transportation Company,
       which he conceived while crossing the Atlantic en route to buy an
       English locomotive. The first 500 T-rails were installed in
       Philadelphia. They would go on to be employed by railroads across
       the United States and are still seen today.^[64]

   1831 Multiple coil magnet
     * A multiple coil magnet is an electromagnet that has several coils
       of wire connected in parallel. This increases the total electric
       current in the electromagnet and therefore generates a stronger
       magnetic field. It was invented by American scientist Joseph Henry
       in 1831.^[65]

   1831 Doorbell (electric)
     * A doorbell is a signaling device commonly found near a door. It
       commonly emits a ringing sound to alert the occupant of the
       building to a visitor's presence. The electric doorbell was
       invented by Joseph Henry in 1831.^[26]^[66]

   1832 Morse code
   A typical "straight key" model used for transmitting and transcribing
   Morse code

   Morse code is a type of character encoding that transmits telegraphic
   information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of
   short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals,
   punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many
   years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer
   to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical
   contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the
   other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and
   transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by
   sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as
   "dots" and "dashes" or "dits" and "dahs". In 1832, Alfred Vail in
   collaboration with Samuel Morse, began the process of co-inventing the
   Morse code signalling alphabet.^[67] After a few minor changes,
   including the development of International Morse code which is distinct
   from the original encoding system, American Morse code, Morse code was
   standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris,
   France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication
   Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations
   beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call
   for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS
   signal.^[68]

   1833 Sewing machine (lock-stitch)

   Most modern sewing machines use the lockstitch technique of sewing
   invented by Walter Hunt, which consists of two threads, an upper and a
   lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of
   or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and
   finally through the hole in the needle. The lower thread is wound onto
   a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the
   machine. Walter Hunt invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in
   1833. Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention.^[69] In
   1846, Elias Howe secured a patent on an original lock-stitch machine,
   and failed to manufacture and market it. Isaac Singer infringed on
   Howe's patent to make his own machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe
   filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a
   federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as
   well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.^[70]

   1834 Combine harvester
   A John Deere combine harvesting corn

   The combine harvester, or combine, or thresher, is a machine that
   combines the tasks of harvesting, threshing, and cleaning grain crops.
   The objective is to complete these three processes, which used to be
   distinct, in one pass of the machine over a particular part of the
   field. The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried
   stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either
   chopped or spread on the field, or baled for livestock feed. The first
   combine harvester was invented by Hiram Moore in 1834.^[71]

   1835 Steam shovel

   A steam shovel is a large steam-powered excavating machine designed for
   lifting and moving material such as rock and soil, typically in the
   mining industry. The steam shovel is composed of a bucket, boom and
   'dipper stick', boiler, water tank and coal bunker, a steam engine, and
   a winch. The steam shovel was invented in 1835 by William Otis, later
   receiving a patent for his invention on February 24, 1839.^[72]

   1835 Wrench

   The wrench or spanner is a tool used to provide a mechanical advantage
   in applying torque to turn bolts, nuts or other items designed to
   interface with a wrench. Although wrenches have existed for centuries,
   possibly the first patent for a new design was issued to Solymon
   Merrick, who was issued U.S. reissue patent #38 on May 7, 1842.^[73]

   1835 Solar compass
   William Austin Burt's solar compass

   A solar compass is a railroad compass with a solar attachment that
   allows surveyors to determine the north direction by reference to the
   sun rather than by reference to the magnetic needle. It consists of
   three arcs: one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed;
   one for setting the declination of the sun; and one for setting the
   hour of the day. In 1835, the solar compass was invented by William
   Austin Burt, a U.S. Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government
   lands in the Michigan Territory earlier in 1833. While experiecing
   great difficulty in using his standard vernier compass in order to
   detect deposits of iron ore in the Northwest Territory (present-day
   Wisconsin), Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of
   the Earth's magnetic field and north-south survey lines would be easier
   to find.^[74]^[75] A patent was issued to Burt on February 25,
   1836.^[76]

   1835 Relay

   A relay is an electrical switch that opens and closes under the control
   of another electrical circuit. In the original form, the switch is
   operated by an electromagnet to open or close one or many sets of
   contacts. The relay was invented by the renowned American scientist,
   Joseph Henry in 1835.^[77]

   1836 Gridiron (cooking)
     * A gridiron is a metal grate with parallel bars typically used for
       grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It
       may also be two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely
       hold food while grilling over an open flame. Gridironing is often
       performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed
       briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a
       combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa
       and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut.^[78] U.S. Patent #78 was
       issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836.^[79] The next
       advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and
       patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins,
       of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent
       #408,136 on July 30, 1889 for a hinged gridiron that would hold the
       meat in place while broiling.^[80]

   1836 Circuit breaker
   400 kV SF[6] live tank circuit breakers

   A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch
   designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by
   overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault
   condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue
   electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be
   replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or
   automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in
   varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household
   appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage
   circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American
   scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the
   circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.^[81]

   1837 Self-polishing cast steel plow

   The plow is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in
   preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument
   for most of recorded history, and represents one of the major advances
   in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry
   out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer
   named John Deere modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old
   sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere
   polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick.
   After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a
   necessity on American farms.^[82]

   1839 Corn sheller

   A corn sheller or maize sheller, is a machine used to shell or shuck
   ears of sweet corn of their silk. By feeding ears of sweet corn into a
   concentric cylindrical rest, they are parallel to the axis of the
   shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed on one side of the machine. As the
   cylindrical rest revolves, an ear falls into each space between staves,
   and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of
   the segment concave. The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and
   the ear of sweet corn is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper,
   after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately
   four or five revolutions. The corn sheller was invented by Lester E.
   Denison of Sayville, Connecticut who received a patent on August 12,
   1839.^[83]

   1839 Sleeping car
     * The sleeping car or sleeper is a railroad passenger car that can
       accommodate passengers in beds, primarily to make nighttime travel
       more restful. The first such cars saw sporadic use on American
       railroads in the 1830s and could be configured for coach seating
       during the day. The pioneer of this new mode of traveling
       transcontinental was the Cumberland Valley Railroad which
       introduced service of the first sleeping car in the spring of 1939.
       The sleeping car did not become commercially practical until 1857
       when George Pullman invented the Pullman sleeping car.^[84]

   1839 Vulcanized rubber
     * Vulcanization refers to a specific curing process of rubber
       involving high heat and the addition of sulfur or other equivalent
       curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are
       linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of
       sulfur atoms or carbon to carbon bonds. A vast array of products
       are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires,
       shoe soles, hoses and many more. When "rubber fever" struck Boston
       in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made
       of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by
       1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods
       turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze
       stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed
       liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove
       top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in
       the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15,
       1844.^[85]

   1839 Babbitt (metal)
     * Babbitt, also called Babbitt metal or bearing metal, is any of
       several alloys characterized by its resistance to galling. Babbitt
       is most commonly used as a thin surface layer in a complex,
       multi-metal structure, but its original use was as a cast-in-place
       bulk bearing material. Babbitt metal was invented in 1839 for use
       in steam engines by American goldsmith Isaac Babbitt in Taunton,
       Massachusetts.^[86]

   1840 Howe truss
     * A Howe truss is a specialized design of a trussed bridge whereby
       the vertical trusses are in tension and the diagonal trusses are
       compressed. Howe trusses slope upwards and towards the center of
       the bridge. The Howe truss was patented in 1840 by William
       Howe.^[87]

   1842 Inhalational anaesthetic
     * Crawford Long, of Jefferson, Georgia, performed the first operation
       using his development of ether-based anesthesia, when he removed a
       tumor from the neck of Mr. James Venable. Long did not reveal the
       practicality of using ether anesthesia until 1849.^[88]

   1842 Grain elevator
     * Grain elevators are buildings or complexes of buildings for storage
       and shipment of grain. They were invented in 1842 in Buffalo, New
       York, by Joseph Dart, who first developed a steam-powered
       mechanism, called a marine leg, for scooping grain out of the hulls
       of ships directly into storage silos.^[89]

   1843 Ice cream maker (hand-cranked)
   An early example of a hand-cranked ice cream maker

   An ice cream maker is a machine used to make small quantities of ice
   cream at home. Ice cream makers may stir the mixture by hand-cranking
   or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a
   freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the
   machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must
   freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent
   the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and
   creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented
   the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked
   the resources to make and market the churn herself. Johnson sold the
   patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made
   enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877,
   more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.^[90]

   1843 Multiple-effect evaporator

   A multiple-effect evaporator, as defined in chemical engineering, is an
   apparatus for efficiently using the heat from steam to evaporate water.
   In 1843, Norbert Rillieux invented and patented the multiple-effect
   evaporator where its first installation and use was in a Louisiana
   sugar factory.^[91]

   1843 Rotary printing press

   A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be
   printed are curved around a cylinder. In 1843, Richard Hoe invented a
   revolution in printing by rolling a cylinder over stationary plates of
   inked type and using the cylinder to make an impression on paper. This
   eliminated the need for making impressions directly from the type
   plates themselves, which were heavy and difficult to maneuver.^[92]

   1844 Pratt truss

   A Pratt truss is a specialized design of a trussed bridge whereby the
   vertical trusses are compressed and the diagonal trusses are in
   tension. Sloping downwards and towards the center of the bridge, Pratt
   trusses therefore create Y and K-shaped patterns. As the exact opposite
   of the Howe truss design, the Pratt truss was co-invented and
   co-patented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt.^[93]

   1845 Pressure-sensitive tape
     * Pressure-sensitive tape, PSA tape, adhesive tape, self-stick tape,
       or sticky tape consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated
       onto a backing material such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or
       metal foil. The first pressure-sensitive tape took the form of
       surgical tape, invented by Dr. Horace Day in 1845.^[94]

   1845 Maynard tape primer
     * The Maynard tape primer is a system designed to allow for more
       rapid reloading of muskets which previously relied on small copped
       caps that were filled with mercury fulminate. Dr. Edward Maynard, a
       dentist with an interest in firearms, embedded tiny pellets of
       priming material in thin strips of paper, then glued a second strip
       of paper on top of the first, creating a "tape" of primer. The tape
       could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much
       less expensive than copper. In 1845, Edward Maynard patented his
       new firearm invention which in later years, would be widely used in
       the American Civil War.^[95]

   1845 Baseball
   A sketch of an early baseball game played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken,
   New Jersey

   As the United States' de facto national sport and pastime, baseball is
   a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each.
   Many historians attribute baseball's origins to the English sports of
   stoolball and rounders as well as to the 18th and 19th century North
   American sports of Old Cat and Town ball, all early precursors to
   baseball. However, the bat-and-ball sports played in the United States,
   Europe, or elsewhere in the world prior to 1845 did not resemble the
   standard of modern day rules as to which baseball has continuously used
   ever since the mid-19th century. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright wrote
   the official and codified set of regulated rules of baseball formally
   known as the Knickerbocker Rules. Cartwright's original 14 rules were
   somewhat similar to but not identical to rounders. Three exceptions
   devised by Cartwright included the stipulations that the playing field
   had to be laid out in a diamond shape rather than a square used in
   rounders, foul territories were to be introduced for the first time,
   and the practice of retiring a runner by hitting him with a thrown ball
   was forbidden. On June 19, 1846, the Knickerbocker Rules were
   instituted for the first time when Cartwright's New York Knickerbockers
   competed against the New York Nine, in what is considered by the
   National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York as
   "the first modern base ball game".^[96] With the myth of Abner
   Doubleday inventing baseball debunked and 46 years after his death,
   Cartwright in 1938, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in the
   executive category.^[97]^[98] On June 3, 1953, the 83rd United States
   Congress unanimously credited Cartwright with inventing the modern
   sport of baseball.^[97]^[99]

   1846 Transverse shuttle
     * The transverse shuttle is a method to drive a bobbin on a sewing
       machine so as to create the lockstitch technique. Transverse
       shuttles carry the bobbin in a boat-shaped shuttle, and reciprocate
       the shuttle along a straight horizontal shaft. As the earliest of
       bobbin drivers, the transverse shuttle was patented by Elias Howe
       on September 10, 1846.^[100]

   1846 Printing telegraph
     * The printing telegraph is a derivative of the electrical telegraph
       which links two 28-key piano-style keyboards by electrical wire
       representing a letter of the alphabet and when pressed causing the
       corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. The receiver
       would then receive the instantly readable text of the message on a
       paper strip. This is in contrast to the electrical telegraphs that
       used Morse Code 'dots' and 'dashes' which needed to be converted
       into readable text. After 1850, the printing telegraph was in
       common use, namely along the United States east coast and in
       France. The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by Royal Earl
       House of Rockland, Vermont.^[101]

   1847 Gas mask
   A gas mask from the Czech Republic

   A gas mask is a mask worn over the face to protect the wearer from
   inhaling "airborne pollutants" and toxic gasses. The mask forms a
   sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and
   other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. The gas mask was invented in
   1847 by Lewis Haslett, a device that contained elements that allowed
   breathing through a nose and mouthpiece, inhalation of air through a
   bulb-shaped filter, and a vent to exhale air back into the
   atmosphere.^[102] According to First Facts, it states that the "gas
   mask resembling the modern type was patented by Lewis Phectic Haslett
   of Louisville, Kentucky who received a patent on June 12, 1849".^[103]
   U.S. patent #6,529 issued to Haslett, described the first "Inhaler or
   Lung Protector" that filtered dust from the air.^[26]^[104]

   1847 Doughnut (ring-shaped)

   A doughnut or donut, is a type of fried dough food popular in many
   countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet (or occasionally
   savory) snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries,
   supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets. They are
   usually sweet, deep-fried from a flour dough, and shaped in rings or
   flattened spheres that sometimes contain fillings. The doughnut has a
   long history, supposedly a Dutch creation exported to New Amsterdam
   (present-day New York City) in the 1600s under the Dutch name of
   olykoeks—"oily cakes". However, the ring-shaped doughnut with a "hole"
   in the center is thought to be an American creation, supposedly
   invented in 1847 by Captain Hanson Gregory of Clam Cove, Maine.^[105]

   1848 Pin tumbler lock
     * The pin tumbler lock is a lock mechanism that uses pins of varying
       lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.
       Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may
       also be found in tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble
       locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to
       their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the
       locks were not practical to use.^[106] In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr.
       invented the modern pin-tumbler lock.^[107] In 1861, Linus Yale,
       Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by
       his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with
       serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock
       itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains
       in use today.^[108]

   1849 Jackhammer
   Drilling a blast hole with a jackhammer

   A jackhammer, also known as a pneumatic hammer, is a portable
   percussive drill powered by compressed air. It is used to drill rock
   and break up concrete pavement, among other applications. It jabs with
   its bit, not rotating it. A jackhammer operates by driving an internal
   hammer up and down. The hammer is first driven down to strike the back
   of the bit and then back up to return the hammer to the original
   position to repeat the cycle. The bit usually recovers from the stroke
   by means of a spring. The earliest form of a jackhammer, a "percussion
   drill" was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch
   of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In this drill, the drill bit passed
   through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit
   and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental
   model.^[109]

   1849 Safety pin

   The safety pin is a fastening device, a variation of the regular pin
   which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves
   two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin
   to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to
   protect the user from the sharp point. The safety pin was invented by
   Walter Hunt, and patented in April 1849. The rights to the invention
   were sold for $400.^[110]

   1850 Dishwasher

   The dishwasher cleans dishes, glassware, and eating utensils. The first
   dishwasher was a wooden one whereby a person would turn a handle to
   splash water on the dishware. It was invented in 1850 by Joel Houghton
   of Ogden, New York. The device was a failure.^[111] Houghton received
   U.S. patent #7,365 on May 14, 1850.^[112] The first successful and
   practical dishwasher was invented in 1886 by Josephine Cochrane. The
   motorized device turned a wheel while soapy water squirted up and
   rained down on the dishware.^[111] Cochran received U.S. patent #355139
   for the "Dish-Washing Machine" on December 28, 1886.^[113]

   1850 Feed dogs
     * Feed dogs are the critical component of a "drop feed" sewing
       machine. A set of feed dogs typically resembles two or three short,
       thin metal bars, crosscut with diagonal teeth, which move back and
       forth in slots in a sewing machine's needle plate. Their purpose is
       to pull ("feed") the fabric through the machine, in discrete steps,
       in-between stitches. Allen B. Wilson invented it during the time
       period 1850 to 1854.^[114] U.S. patent #12116 was issued on
       December 18, 1854.^[115]

   1850 Vibrating shuttle
   A vibrating shuttle in its carrier

   A vibrating shuttle is a bobbin driver design used in home lockstitch
   sewing machines during the second half of the 19th century and the
   first half of the 20th century. It supplanted the earlier transverse
   shuttle design invented by Elias Howe in 1846, but was itself
   supplanted by the rotary hook later on. American cabinetmaker Allen B.
   Wilson of Willet, New York invented the vibrating shuttle design in
   1850. The owners of the 1848 Bradshaw patent claimed infringement by
   Wilson. However, it was without justication. In order to avoid a
   lawsuit, Wilson relinquished his interest in U.S. Patent #7,776 that
   was issued to him on November 12, 1850. A.P. Kline and Edward Lee took
   ownership.^[116]

   1850 Inverted microscope

   An inverted microscope is a microscope with its light source and
   condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the
   objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up. The inverted
   microscope was invented in 1850 by J. Lawrence Smith, a faculty member
   of Tulane University and the Medical College of Louisiana.^[26]^[117]

   1851 Rotary hook

   A rotary hook is a bobbin driver design used in lockstitch sewing
   machines of the 19th and 20th century and beyond. It triumphed over
   competing designs because it could run at higher speeds with less
   vibration. Rotary hook machines hold their bobbin stationary, and
   continuously rotate the thread hook around it. The rotary hook was
   co-invented by American cabinetmaker Allen B. Wilson and Nathaniel
   Wheeler in 1851.^[118] U.S. Patent # 8,296 was issued to Wilson on
   August 12, 1851.^[119]

   1851 Fire alarm box
     * A fire alarm box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire
       department of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and
       were the main method of calling the fire department to a
       neighborhood in the days before people had telephones. When the box
       is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal
       onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The
       receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the
       neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in
       Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and
       Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their
       revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40
       miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.^[120]

   1852 Elevator brake
     * An elevator or lift is a vertical transport vehicle that
       efficiently moves people or goods between floors of a building. In
       1852, Elisha Graves Otis invented the first safety brake for
       elevators which prevents an elevator from spiralling into a free
       fall between numerous floors inside a building.^[121]

   1853 Burglar alarm
     * A burglar alarm contains sensors which are connected to a control
       unit via a low-voltage hardwire or narrowband RF signal which is
       used to interact with a response device. The alarm was patented
       (U.S. patent #9,802) on June 21, 1853 by the Reverend Augustus
       Russell Pope of Somerville, Massachusetts.^[122]^[123] As the first
       person to commercialize Pope's invention, Edwin Holmes acquired
       Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1,500.^[124]

   1853 Potato chips
     * Potato chips, also known as crisps in British English, are thin
       slices of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato
       chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips
       are cooked and salted, and additional varieties are manufactured
       using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings,
       herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original
       potato chip recipe was invented by chef George Crum at Moon's Lake
       House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853.^[125]
       Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes
       back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided
       to slice the potatoes so thin that they could not be eaten with a
       fork. As they could not be fried normally in a pan, he decided to
       stir-fry the potato slices. Against Crum's expectation, the guest
       was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular
       item on the lodge's menu, and were known as "Saratoga chips".^[126]

   1853 spring Clothespin
   A clothespin with metal lever action

   A clothespin is a fastener with a lever action used to hang up clothes
   for drying, usually on a clothes line. Clothespins often come in many
   different designs. Although wooden clothes pegs for a few decades
   already, the "spring-clamp" for clotheslines was patented by David M.
   Smith of Springfield, Vermont, in 1853.^[127]

   1854 Breast pump

   A breast pump is a mechanical device that extracts milk from the
   breasts of a lactating woman. Breast pumps may be manual devices
   powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by
   mains electricity or batteries. The first breast pump was patented by
   O.H. Needham on June 20, 1854.^[128]

   1855 Calliope

   Also known as a steam organ or steam piano, a calliope is a musical
   instrument that produces sound by sending a gas, originally steam or
   more recently compressed air, through large whistles, originally
   locomotive whistles. It was often played on riverboats and in circuses,
   where it was sometimes mounted on a carved, painted and gilded
   horse-drawn wagon in a circus parade. The calliope was invented in 1855
   by Joshua C. Stoddard of Worcester, Massachusetts.^[129] U.S. patent
   #13,668 was issued to Stoddard on October 9, 1855.^[130]

   1856 Egg beater
   A vintage egg beater

   An egg beater is a hand-cranked mixing device for whipping, beating,
   and folding food ingredients. It typically consists of a handle mounted
   over a piston, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are
   immersed in the food to be mixed. In 1856, American tinner Ralph
   Collier of Baltimore, Maryland, invented and patented the first rotary
   egg beater with rotating parts.^[131] Collier was issued U.S. patent
   #16,267 on December 23, 1856.^[132]

   1856 Condensed milk

   Condensed milk is cow's milk from which water has been removed and to
   which sugar has been added, yielding a very thick, sweet product that
   can last for years without refrigeration if unopened. Gail Borden
   invented condensed milk in 1856 and was later used by soldiers during
   the American Civil War.^[133]

   1856 Equatorial sextant

   The equatorial sextant is a navigational instrument that is used to get
   an accurate bearing and position of a ship at sea, and to take
   azimuths, altitude, time and declination while making
   observations.^[134] Also known as an altitude Instrument, the equatoral
   sextant was first invented and made by William Austin Burt. He patented
   it on November 4, 1856 in the United States as U.S. patent
   #16,002.^[135]

   1857 Toilet paper (mass-produced and rolled)
     * Toilet paper is a soft paper product (tissue paper) used to
       maintain personal hygiene after human defecation or urination.
       However, it can also be used for other purposes such as absorbing
       spillages or craft projects. Toilet paper in different forms has
       been used for centuries, namely in China. The ancient Greeks used
       clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But according
       to a CNN article, the idea of a commercial product designed solely
       to wipe a person's buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur
       Joseph Gayetty, who in 1857, invented aloe-infused sheets of manila
       hemp dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. However, Gayetty's toilet
       paper was a failure for several reasons. Americans soon grew
       accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, they saw no
       need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use
       came in the mail for free, and because during the 19th century, it
       was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others.
       Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers
       named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott of the Scott Paper Company
       co-invented rolled toilet paper.^[136]

   1857 Pink lemonade
     * Pink lemonade is a variant of lemonade that uses artificial flavors
       and colors as well as natural sources of juices (such as grenadine,
       cherry juice, red grapefruit juice, grape juice, cranberry juice,
       strawberry juice, and pomegranate) to give it a "pink" coloration.
       The earliest reference to the invention of pink lemonade according
       to historian Joe Nickell, was that Pete Conklin invented the drink
       in 1857 when he used water dyed pink from a horse rider's red
       tights to make his lemonade.^[137]

   1857 Brown Truss
     * A Brown truss is a type of bridge truss, used in covered bridges.
       It is noted for its economical use of materials, taking the form of
       a box truss. There may be vertical or almost vertical tension
       members, but there are no vertical members in compression. In
       practice, when used in a covered bridge, the most common
       application, the truss is protected with outside sheathing. The
       Brown Truss was invented and patented by Josiah Brown Jr. in
       1857.^[138]

   1858 screw top Pepper shaker
   A pepper shaker with a screw-on cap

   Salt and pepper shakers are typically placed on tabletops in
   restaurants and in home kitchens. Used as condiment holders in Western
   culture, salt and pepper shakers are designed to store and dispense
   edible salt and ground peppercorns. The first pepper shaker with
   screw-on cap was invented by John Landis Mason who received a patent on
   November 30, 1858.^[139]

   1858 Mason jar

   In home canning, food is packed into a jar, and the steel lid is placed
   on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim of
   the jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air
   and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was
   the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The
   earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing
   wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin
   lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John
   Landis Mason and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on
   millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.^[140]

   1858 Pencil eraser
   An eraser attached to a graphite pencil

   A pencil eraser is an article of stationery attached to the opposite
   end of a graphite pencil's sharpened tip. The eraser itself is
   typically made out of gum-like or synthetic rubber that is used for
   rubbing out pencil mistakes on paper. On April 15, 1770, English
   inventor Joseph Priestley described a vegetable gum to remove pencil
   marks. On March 30, 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for
   the conception and the idea of attaching an eraser to the end of a
   pencil.^[141] In 1862 Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for
   $100,000, who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber-Castell for
   infringement.^[142] In 1875, the Supreme Court of the United States
   ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid.^[143]

   1858 Ironing board

   An ironing board is a portable and foldable table with a heat resistant
   top used in the aid of removing wrinkles from clothing with an iron and
   spray starch. The first ironing board was co-patented on February 16,
   1858 by inventors William Vandenburg and James Harvey of New York
   City.^[144]

   1858 Twine knotter

   A twine binder is a mechanical device or machine that wraps knotted
   twine around a bundle or sheave of grain in bound form after it has
   been reaped. While working at a farm in Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1857,
   John Appleby invented the twine knotter. Incorporating many of Jacob
   Behel's innovations as found in his development of the "billhook"
   knotter in 1864, Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to
   William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the
   practicability of Appleby's twine knotter into a commercially
   profitable reaper-binder.^[145]

   1858 Dustpan
     * A dustpan is a cleaning utensil commonly used in combination with a
       broom. The dustpan may appear to be a type of flat scoop. The
       dustpan was invented and patented (U.S. patent #20,811) by the
       American inventor T.E. McNeill in 1858.^[146]

   1859 Electric stove
     * An electric stove is a large kitchen appliance that converts
       electricity into heat in order to cook and bake food. In addition
       to heated coils atop a stovetop range, glass-ceramic cooktops and
       induction stoves using electromagnetic induction have proven to be
       popular in commercial kitchens as well as for domestic use in
       homes. Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn is often credited with
       inventing the electric cooking range in 1882. However, the first
       such patent for an electrical stove apparatus was awarded in the
       United States much earlier to George B. Simpson on September 20,
       1859. Simpson's patent, US patent #25532 for an 'electro-heater'
       surface heated by an platinum-wire coil powered by batteries;^[147]
       is described in his own words to be useful to "warm rooms, boil
       water, cook victuals...".^[148]

   1859 Escalator
   A typical escalator tube on the London Underground

   An escalator is a moving staircase, a conveyor transport device for
   carrying people between floors of a building. Commonly found and used
   in shopping malls, department stores, airports, an escalator consists
   of a motor-driven chain of individual, linked steps that move up or
   down on tracks, allowing the step treads to remain horizontal. The
   escalator was invented in 1859 by Nathan Ames of Saugus, Massachusetts
   for an invention that he called "Revolving Stairs".^[26] However, Ames'
   escalator was never built. The earliest form of a working escalator,
   patented in 1892 by Jesse W. Reno, was introduced as a new novelty ride
   at the Old Iron Pier at Coney Island, New York in 1896.^[149]

   1860 Vacuum cleaner

   A vacuum cleaner uses a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt,
   usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the
   first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper instead of a
   vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a rotating brush like a
   traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows
   mechanism on top of the body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess
   received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first
   vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860.^[150]^[151]^[152] Despite credit
   usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the
   first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated
   two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who
   invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899.^[153] However, neither
   were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum
   cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from
   Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box,
   and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.^[154]

   1860 Repeating rifle (lever action)
     * A repeating rifle is a single barreled rifle containing multiple
       rounds of ammunition. Benjamin Tyler Henry, chief designer for
       Oliver Fisher Winchester's arms company, adapted a breech-loading
       rifle built by Walter Hunt and invented the first practical lever
       action repeating rifle in 1860. First known as the Henry rifle, it
       became famously known as the Winchester by Union soldiers in the
       American Civil War.^[155]

Civil War and the Reconstruction Era (1861–1877)[edit]

   1861 Jelly bean
   A handful of jelly beans

   Jelly beans are a small bean-shaped type of confectionery with a hard
   candy shell and a gummy interior which come in a wide variety of
   flavors. The confection is primarily made of sugar. The Turkish
   Delight, a Middle Eastern candy made of soft jelly, covered in
   confectioner's powder, with roots dating to biblical days, was an early
   precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior. However,
   it is generally thought that jelly beans first surfaced in 1861 when
   Boston confectioner and inventor William Schrafft urged people to send
   his jelly beans to soldiers during the American Civil War. It wasn't
   until July 5, 1905 that the mentioning of jelly beans was published in
   the Chicago Daily News. The advertisement publicized bulk jelly beans
   sold by volume for nine cents per pound, according to the book, "The
   Century in Food: America's Fads and Favorites". Today, most historians
   contend that in the United States, they were first linked with Easter
   in the 1930s.^[156]

   1861 Twist drill

   A twist drill is a bit with two cut grooves in opposite sides of a
   round bar, whereby the twisted bar produces a helical flute in order to
   drill holes in metal, plastic, or wood. The twist drill was invented by
   Stephen A. Morse in October 1861 and later patented on April 7,
   1863.^[157]

   1861 Kinematoscope
     * The kinematoscope is a device using the principles of stereoscopy
       in order to present the illusion of a motion picture. Viewed from
       inside a cabinet, the images with chronologically successive stages
       of action which were mounted on blades of a spinning paddle. The
       kinematoscope was invented by Coleman Sellers II of Philadelphia
       who received U.S. patent #31,357 on February 5, 1861.^[158]^[159]

   1861 Postcard
     * A postcard or post card is a rectangular piece of material, such as
       paper, leather or other materials, intended for writing and mailing
       without an envelope. "Postal card" is the term used for a post card
       issued by a postal authority, generally with postage prepaid. The
       post card was invented by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia in 1861
       for which he obtained the copyright later transferred to Hymen
       Lipman. The cards were adorned with a small border and labeled
       "Lipman's Postal Card, Patent Applied For". and later "Copy-right
       Secured 1861". They were on the market until 1873 when the first
       United States issued postcards appeared.^[160]

   1861 Machine gun (hand-cranked)
     * The machine gun is typically considered to be a fully automatic
       firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick
       succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. The
       Gatling gun, invented and patented in 1861 by Richard Gatling
       during the American Civil War, was the earliest precursor to a
       machine gun in the sense that it had all of the underlying features
       of reliable loading as well as the ability to fire sustained
       multiple bursts of rounds, the only drawback being, it had to be
       manually operated and hand-cranked unlike its 1884 successor, the
       Maxim gun, which was indisputably the world's first true machine
       gun.^[161]^[162]

   1863 Breakfast cereal
   A bowl of breakfast cereal filled with milk and topped with raspberries

   Breakfast cereal is a packaged food product intended to be consumed as
   part of a breakfast. The first breakfast cereal, Granula was invented
   in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of the
   Jackson Sanitorium in Dansville, New York. The cereal never became
   popular since it was inconvenient, as the heavy bran nuggets needed
   soaking overnight before they were tender enough to eat.^[163]

   1863 Ratchet wrench

   A socket wrench, more commonly referred to as a ratchet, is a type of
   wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to
   fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts
   and bolts. The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of
   Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratcher wrench from the
   Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.^[164]

   1863 Quad skates

   Quad skates are four-wheeled turning roller skates set in two
   side-by-side pairs. In 1863, James Leonard Plimpton of Medford,
   Massachusetts, invented the first four-wheeled roller skates arranged
   in two side-by-side pairs. Before Plimpton's invention, all wheels on
   the bottom of roller skates were inline.^[165]

   1863 Double-barreled cannon
   The double-barreled cannon prototype located in Athens, Georgia

   The double-barreled cannon is an American Civil War-era experimental
   weapon that was intended to fire two cannonballs connected with a
   chain. While originally built for warfare for the Confederacy, the
   cannon never saw battle. The prototype is now on display and is a
   modern landmark located in Athens, Georgia. In 1863, John Gilleland
   invented the double-barreled cannon.^[166]

   1864 Spar torpedo

   The spar torpedo consists of a bomb placed at the end of a long pole,
   or spar, and attached to a boat. The weapon is used by running the end
   of the spar into the enemy ship. Spar torpedoes were often equipped
   with a barbed spear at the end, so it would stick to wooden hulls. A
   fuse could then be used to detonate it. The spar torpedo was invented
   in 1864 during the American Civil War by E. C. Singer, a private
   engineer who worked on secret projects for the benefit of the
   Confederate States of America.^[167]

   1865 Cowboy hat

   The cowboy hat is a high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat best known as the
   defining piece of attire for the North American cowboy. Today it is
   worn by many people, and is particularly associated with ranch workers
   in the western and southern United States, western Canada and northern
   Mexico, with country-western singers, and for participants in the North
   American rodeo circuit. It is recognized around the world as part of
   Old West cowboy lore. The shape of a cowboy hat's crown and brim are
   often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against
   weather. The cowboy hat was invented in 1865 by John Batterson Stetson
   during a hunting trip, showing his companions how he could make fabric
   out of fur without weaving. Using the fur collected during the trip,
   his bare hands, and boiling water, Stetson made a piece of felt and
   then shaping it into a hat with a large brim which could protect he and
   his hunting party from weather elements such as rain, wind, and
   snow.^[168]

   1865 Rotary printing press (web)
     * In 1865, William Bullock invented a printing press that could feed
       paper on a continuous roll and print both sides of the paper at
       once. Used first by the Philadelphia Ledger, the machine would
       become an American standard. It would also kill its inventor, who
       died when he accidentally fell into one of his presses.^[169]

   1866 Urinal (restroom version)
     * Not to be confused with a urinal in bottle form that is used in
       health care, a urinal is a specialized toilet for urinating only,
       generally by men and boys. It has the form of being wall mounted,
       with drainage and automatic or manual flushing. The urinal was
       patented by Andrew Rankin on March 27, 1866.^[170]

   1866 Chuckwagon
     * The chuckwagon is a wagon that carries food and cooking equipment
       on the prairies of the United States and Canada. They were part of
       a wagon train of settlers to feed nomadic workers like cowboys or
       loggers. While mobile kitchens had existed for generations, the
       invention of the chuckwagon is attributed to Texan rancher Charles
       Goodnight who introduced the concept in 1866.^[171]

   1867 Motorcycle (steam-powered)
   An 1860s drawing of the Roper steam velocipede

   The motorcycle is a single-track, two-wheeled motor vehicle powered by
   an engine. Although the first gasoline/petrol motorcycle powered by an
   internal combustion engine was built in 1885 by a German named Gottlieb
   Daimler, his may not have been the first motorcycle. Ironically,
   Daimler's motorcycle used a four-stroke internal combustion engine that
   wasn't of his own creation, instead having to rely upon an engine built
   by Nicolaus August Otto which he simply mounted onto the frame of a
   bicycle. Furthermore, if the definition of a motorcycle is inclusive of
   a steam engine and not exclusive to an internal combustion engine, then
   the world's first motorcycle may either have been American; a
   coal-powered, two-cylinder, steam-driven motorcycle known as the Roper
   steam velocipede invented by Sylvester Howard Roper in
   1867;^[172]^[173] or perhaps a French one, independently invented by a
   competing claim by French blacksmith Pierre Michaux and engineer
   Louis-Guillaume Perreaux, who invented the Michaux-Perreaux steam
   velocipede in 1868.^[174]

   1867 Paper clip

   The paper clip attaches sheets of paper together, allowing them to be
   detached as necessary. The first patent for a bent wire paper clip was
   awarded to its inventor, Samuel B. Fay, in 1867.^[175]

   1867 Barbed wire
     * Barbed wire is a type of fencing wire constructed with sharp edges
       or points arranged at intervals along the strands. It is used to
       construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls surrounding
       secured property. It is also a major feature of the fortifications
       in trench warfare. A person or animal trying to pass through or
       over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury. Barbed
       wire fencing requires only fence posts, wire, and fixing devices
       such as staples. On June 25, 1867, Lucien B. Smith of Kent, Ohio,
       patented barbed wire. Shortly thereafter, several other inventors,
       such as Joseph F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois, patented inventions
       for similar products, but Smith patented his first, allowing him to
       claim that he invented barbed wire.^[176]

   1867 Ticker tape
     * Ticker tape is a means of transmitting stock price information over
       telegraph lines. It consists of a paper strip which ran through a
       machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company
       symbols followed by price and volume information. Ticker tape was
       invented in 1867 by Edward A. Calahan, an employee of the American
       Telegraph Company.^[177]

   1867 Water-tube boiler
     * A water-tube boiler is a type of boiler in which water circulates
       in tubes heated externally by the fire. Water-tube boilers are used
       for high-pressure boilers. Fuel is burned inside the furnace,
       creating hot gas which heats up water in the steam-generating
       tubes. The water-tube boiler was co-invented and co-patented by
       George Herman Babcock and Stephen Wilcox in 1867.^[178]

   1867 Refrigerator car
     * A refrigerator car or "reefer" is a refrigerated boxcar, designed
       to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator
       cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars,
       neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. They can be
       ice-cooled, or use one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration
       systems, or utilize carbon dioxide as a cooling agent. In the
       1860s, slaughtered cattle from the Great Plains were preserved in
       barrels of salt. Regular box cars were loaded with ice in another
       effort to preserve fresh meat that had limited success. Generally,
       it was found more economical in the early days of refrigeration to
       cool the cars with ice or frozen brine which was periodically
       replenished at icing stations along rail routes. In 1857, the first
       shipment of refrigerated beef was made from the Chicago stockyards
       to the East Coast in an ordinary box car packed with ice. Finally
       in 1867, the first patent (U.S. Patent #71,423) for a specialized
       refrigerator car was issued to its inventor, J.B. Sutherland of
       Detroit, Michigan.^[179]

   1868 Paper bag
   Two paper bags

   A bag is a non-rigid or semi-rigid container usually made of paper
   which is used to hold items or packages. In 1868, Margaret E. Knight
   while living in Springfield, Massachusetts invented a machine that
   folded and glued paper to form the brown paper bags familiar to what
   shoppers know and use today.^[180]

   1868 Tape measure

   A tape measure or measuring tape is a flexible form of ruler. It
   consists of a ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber glass, or metal strip
   with linear-measurement markings. The design on which most modern
   spring tape measures are built was invented and patented by a New
   Haven, Connecticut resident named Alvin J. Fellows on July 14,
   1868.^[181]

   1869 Vibrator

   A vibrator is a device intended to vibrate against the body and
   stimulate the nerves for a relaxing and pleasurable feeling. Some
   vibrators are designed as sex toys and are inserted inside the vagina
   or anus for erotic stimulation. The first vibrator was a steam-powered
   massager, which was invented by American physician George Taylor in
   1869.^[182] Dr. Taylor recommended his vibrators for treatment of an
   illness known at the time as "female hysteria". Hysteria, from the
   Greek for "suffering uterus", involved anxiety, irritability, sexual
   fantasies, pelvic heaviness, and excessive vaginal lubrication—in other
   words, sexual arousal.^[183]^[184]

   1869 American football
   A quarterback preparing to throw a pass

   American football, known in the United States simply as football, is a
   spectator sport known for combining strategy with competitive physical
   play. The objective of the game is to score points by advancing the
   ball into the opposing team's end zone. The ball can be advanced by
   carrying it (a running play) or by throwing it to a teammate (a passing
   play). Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying
   the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over
   that goal line, kicking the ball through the goal posts at the
   opponent's end zone, or tackling an opposing ball carrier within his
   end zone. The winner is the team with the most points when the time
   expires. The very first game of American football, a collegiate one,
   was held on November 6, 1869 between Rutgers University and Princeton
   University with a final score of Rutgers 6 Princeton 4.^[185] The first
   professional game of American football was held on November 12, 1892
   between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh Athletic
   Club ending in a 6–6 tie.^[186] As a descendant of rugby, the modern
   sport now known as American football is generally credited to its
   inventor, Walter Camp, who beginning in the 1880s, devised the play
   from scrimmage, the numerical assessment of goals and tries, the
   restriction of play to eleven men per side, set plays, sequences, and
   strategy features which led to the gradual evolution of the regulated
   game. Camp also was the leader of the American Football Rules Committee
   which devised the set of codified and regulated rules as to which
   American football continuously uses.^[187]

   1869 Pipe wrench
     * The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an adjustable wrench used
       for turning soft iron pipes and fittings with a rounded surface.
       The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame,
       such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws
       tighter together. Teeth angled in the direction of turn dig into
       the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson
       in 1869.^[188]

   1869 Clothes hanger
     * A clothes hanger, or coat hanger, is a device in the shape of human
       shoulders designed to facilitate the hanging of a coat, jacket,
       sweater, shirt, blouse, or dress in a manner that prevents
       wrinkles, with a lower bar for the hanging of trousers or skirts.
       The shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was inspired by a coat hook
       invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain, Connecticut.^[189]

   1870 Bee smoker
   Firing a bee smoker

   A bee smoker, usually called simply a smoker, is a device used in
   beekeeping to calm honey bees. It is designed to generate smoke from
   the smouldering of various fuels, hence the name. The first bee smoker,
   which incorporated a bellows with a fire pot, was invented in 1870 by
   the renowned American beekeeper, Moses Quinby.^[190]

   1870 Can opener (rotary)

   The can opener is a device used to open metal cans. Most non-electrical
   can openers today use the hand-cranked rotary version consisting of a
   wheel with serrated edges in order to pierce and cut the top of tin
   cans. The first rotary can opener with a cutting wheel was invented in
   1870 by William W. Lyman, of Meriden, Connecticut, who received a U.S.
   Patent 105,346 on July 12, 1870. In 1925 the Star Can Opener Company of
   San Francisco improved on Lyman's wheel blade by adding a second,
   serrated or toothed wheel, called a "feed wheel" or "turning gear" to
   ride below the rim of the can and rotate the can against the cutting
   wheel.^[191]

   1870 Sandblasting

   Sandblasting or bead blasting is a generic term for the process of
   smoothing, shaping, and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid
   particles across that surface at high speeds. Sandblasting equipment
   typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The
   mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles
   toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles come in a variety of shapes,
   sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles
   because it resists abrasive wear well. In 1870, the sandblasting
   process was invented and patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman.^[192]

   1870 Feather duster
     * A feather duster is an implement used for cleaning. It consists
       typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto
       the handle by a wrapped wire. In 1870, the original idea for the
       feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in Jones County,
       Iowa, USA. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the
       factory asking if they could be used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag
       used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a
       short broom stick and splitting the feathers with a pocket knife,
       the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag
       Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather
       dusters in the U.S. state of Iowa.^[193]

   1871 Rowing machine
     * A rowing machine or indoor rower, is a machine used to simulate the
       action of watercraft rowing for the purpose of exercise or training
       for rowing. Indoor rowing has become established as a sport in its
       own right. The term also refers to a participant in this sport.
       Rowing machines have been in use for bout 140 years. The earliest
       patent for such a machine was filed in the United States by William
       B. Curtis.^[194] Curtis was issued U.S. patent #116,417 on June 27,
       1871.^[195]

   1872 Railway air brake
   A valve on a railway air brake

   A railway air brake is a conveyance braking system which applies the
   means of compressed air which modern locomotives use to this day.
   George Westinghouse, a pioneer of the electrical industry, invented the
   railroad air brake in 1872.^[196]

   1872 Diner

   A diner is a restaurant characterized by a wide range of foods, a
   casual and often nostalgic atmosphere, a counter, and late operating
   hours. The precursor to the fast food eatery began in 1872 when Walter
   Scott, a myopic pressman for the Providence Journal, became serious
   about selling food and refreshments in the streets. Scott had a plan.
   Instead of wearing out the soles of his shoes and roaming the streets
   of Providence, Rhode Island, he decided to buy a horse-drawn delivery
   van. Rolling on four wagon wheels, he would take his food to the
   people.^[197]

   1873 Earmuffs

   Earmuffs cover a person's ears for thermal protection. Earmuffs consist
   of a thermoplastic or metal head-band, that fits over the top of the
   head, and a pad at each end, to cover the external ears. Earmuffs were
   invented by Chester Greenwood in 1873.^[198]

   1873 Silo
   Two farm silos

   A silo is a structure for storing bulk materials. Silos are used in
   agriculture to store grain, see grain elevators, or fermented feed
   known as silage. Silos are more commonly used for bulk storage of
   grain, coal, cement, carbon black, woodchips, food products and
   sawdust. The first modern silo, a wooden and upright one filled with
   grain, was invented and built in 1873 by Fred Hatch of McHenry County,
   Illinois, USA.^[199]^[200]

   1873 Jeans

   Jeans are trousers generally made from denim. Jeans became popular
   among teenagers starting in the 1950s which remains as a distinct icon
   of American fashion. In 1873, Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis co-invented
   and co-patented the idea of using copper rivets at the stress points of
   sturdy work pants. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth
   to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to
   reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at
   the top of the button fly. Davis did not have the required money to
   purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they both go
   into business together. Early Levis, called "waist overalls", came in a
   brown canvas duck fabric and a heavy blue denim fabric. His business
   became extremely successful, revolutionizing the apparel
   industry.^[201]

   1873 Knuckle coupler
   Two railway cars interlocked and joined together by a knuckle coupler

   Also known as a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler, the knuckle
   coupler is the derivative of a coupling device that links and connects
   rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and
   stock cars together on railroad track. The knuckle coupler have a
   bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when brought in
   contact with another coupler, automatically interlocks with its mate.
   Knuckle couplers replaced the much more dangerous link-and-pin couplers
   and became the basis for standard coupler design for the rest of the
   19th century. The knuckle coupler was invented and patented by Eli H.
   Janney in 1873.^[202]^[203]^[204]

   1874 Fire sprinkler (automated)

   A fire sprinkler is the part of a fire sprinkler system that discharges
   water when the effects of a fire have been detected, such as when a
   pre-determined temperature has been reached. Henry S. Parmelee of New
   Haven, Connecticut invented and installed the first closed-head or
   automated fire sprinkler in 1874.^[205]

   1874 Spork

   A spork or a foon is a hybrid form of cutlery taking the form of a
   spoon-like shallow scoop with three or four fork tines. The spork is a
   portmanteau word combining spoon and fork. The spork was invented in
   1874 by Samuel W. Francis. U.S. patent #147,119 was filed on January
   22, 1874 and issued to Francis on February 3, 1874.^[206]

   1874 Ice cream soda
     * An ice cream soda is a beverage that consists of one or more scoops
       of ice cream in either a soft drink or a mixture of flavored syrup
       and carbonated water. Variations of the ice cream soda are as
       countless as the varieties of soda and flavors of ice cream. An
       example of ice cream soda is the root beer float. In 1874, the ice
       cream soda was invented by Robert M. Green of Philadelphia. Green's
       invention paved the way for the soda fountain industry to flourish
       and for many new spoon novelties such as ice cream sundaes to be
       created.^[207]

   1874 Quadruplex telegraph
     * A quadruplex telegraph is a type of electrical telegraph which
       allows a total of four separate signals to be transmitted and
       received on a single wire at the same time. With two signals in
       each direction, quadruplex telegraphy thus implements a form of
       multiplexing. The quadruplex telegraph was invented by Thomas Alva
       Edison in 1874, which enabled Western Union to save money by
       greatly increasing the number of messages the company could send
       without building new lines. It also allowed the company to use its
       existing lines more efficiently to meet seasonal increases in
       message traffic and to lease excess capacity for private
       lines.^[208]

   1874 Jockstrap
   Marpage jockstrap and packaging, circa 1930

   A jockstrap, also known as a jock, jock strap, strap, supporter, or
   athletic supporter, is an undergarment designed for supporting the male
   genitalia during sports or other vigorous physical activity. A
   jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually elastic) with a support
   pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed to the base of
   the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip.
   The jockstrap has been part of men's undergarments since 1874 when it
   was invented by C.F. Bennett of Chicago to protect and support bicycle
   riders (back then they were known as "jockeys") who were navigating the
   cobblestone streets common to the era.^[209]^[210]

   1874 Forstner bit

   Forstner bits, also known as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers,
   bore precise, flat-bottomed holes in wood, in any orientation with
   respect to the wood grain. Forstner bits can cut on the edge of a block
   of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to
   the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to
   add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin
   Forstner in 1874.^[211]

   1874 QWERTY

   QWERTY is the most used modern-day keyboard layout on English-language
   computer and typewriter keyboards. It takes its name from the first six
   characters seen in the far left of the keyboard's top row of letters.
   The QWERTY design was invented and patented by Christopher Sholes in
   1874.^[212]

   1875 Biscuit cutter
     * A biscuit cutter a tool to cut out a biscuit from bread dough in a
       particular shape before they are put into an oven to bake. On May
       11, 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne filed the first patent for the
       biscuit cutter that consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out
       on and hinged to a metal plate with various biscuit cutter shapes
       mounted to it. It was later issued on November 30, 1875.^[213]

   1875 Dental drill (electric)
     * A dental drill is a small, high-speed drill used in dentistry to
       remove decayed tooth material prior to the insertion of a dental
       filling. George F. Green of Kalamazoo, Michigan invented the first
       electric powered device to drill teeth in 1875.^[214]

   1875 Mimeograph
     * The stencil duplicator or mimeograph machine is a low-cost printing
       press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once
       prepared, the stencil is wrapped around the ink-filled drum of the
       rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the
       rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the
       holes on the stencil onto the paper. Thomas Alva Edison invented
       the mimeograph in 1875.^[215]

   1876 Synthesizer
     * A synthesizer is an electronic instrument capable of producing
       sounds by generating electrical signals of different frequencies.
       These electrical signals are played through a loudspeaker or set of
       headphones. Synthesizers can usually produce a wide range of
       sounds, which may either imitate other instruments ("imitative
       synthesis") or generate new timbres. The first electric synthesizer
       was invented in 1876 by Elisha Gray who accidentally discovered
       that he could control sound from a self vibrating electromagnetic
       circuit and in doing so, invented a basic single note oscillator.
       This musical telegraph used steel reeds whose oscillations were
       created and transmitted, over a telephone line, by electromagnets.
       Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device in later models
       consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the
       oscillator audible.^[216]^[217]

   1876 Airbrush
     * An airbrush is a small, air-operated tool that sprays various media
       including ink and dye, but most often paint by a process of
       nebulization. Spray guns developed from the airbrush and are still
       considered a type of airbrush. The first airbrush was invented in
       1876 by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts.^[218]

   1876 Tattoo machine
     * A tattoo machine is a hand-held device generally used to create a
       tattoo, a permanent marking of the skin with ink. The basic
       machine, which was called Stencil-Pens, was invented by Thomas Alva
       Edison and patented in the United States in 1876. It was originally
       intended to be used as an engraving device, but in 1891, Sean Casey
       discovered that Edison's machine could be modified and used to
       introduce ink into the skin, and later patented it as a tube and
       needle system serving as an ink reservoir.^[219]

   1877 Phonograph
   Thomas Edison's talking machine

   The phonograph, record player or gramophone is an instrument for
   recording, reproducing and playing back sounds. The earliest
   phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on
   the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was
   played. Later, the gramophone record with modulated spiral grooves set
   atop a rotating turntable. The phonograph was invented in 1877 by
   Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey,
   USA.^[220]^[221]^[222]^[223] On February 8, 1878, Edison was issued the
   first patent (U.S. patent #200,521) for the phonograph.^[224]

   1877 District heating

   District heating distributes heat generated in a centralized location
   for residential and commercial heating requirements. The heat is often
   obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but
   increasingly biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal
   heating and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear
   power. A system was built in France in the 14th Century and the United
   States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland began steam district
   heating service in 1853. However, the first commercially successful
   district heating system was launched in Lockport, New York, in 1877 by
   American hydraulic engineer Birdsill Holly, considered the founder of
   modern district heating.^[225]

Gilded Age (1878–1889)[edit]

   1878 Carbon microphone
     * The carbon microphone is a sound-to-electrical signal transducer
       consisting of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon.
       When sound waves strike this plate, the pressure on the granules
       changes, which in turn changes the electrical resistance between
       the plates. A direct current is passed from one plate to the other,
       and the changing resistance results in a changing current, which
       can be passed through a telephone system, or used in other ways in
       electronics systems to change the sound into an electrical signal.
       After a lengthy court battle over patent rights filed in 1877, a
       United States federal court as well as a British court in 1878
       ruled in favor of Thomas Alva Edison over a claim held by Emile
       Berliner since Edison indisputably preceded Berliner in inventing
       the transmission of speech as well as the use of carbon in a
       transmitter.^[226]

   1878 Free jet water turbine
     * A free jet water turbine or impulse water turbine, also commonly
       known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets,
       that are split down the middle by a metal divider, so that in
       effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each "spoke" in the
       wheel. A high-pressure water jet aimed at the center of each bucket
       is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the
       other on the right. The design of this water turbine takes
       advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force
       defined as the product of the force and the time during which it
       acts. In 1878, Lester Pelton invented his prototype known as the
       Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra
       Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his
       invention.^[227]

   1878 Bolometer
     * A bolometer measures the energy of incident electromagnetic
       radiation. It was invented in 1878 by American astronomer Samuel
       Pierpont Langley.^[228]

   1879 mechanical production of Photographic plate
     * Photographic plates preceded photographic film as a means of
       photography. A light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was applied
       to a glass plate. This form of photographic material largely faded
       from the consumer market in the early years of the 20th century, as
       more convenient and less fragile films were introduced. The wet
       collodion process was replaced by dry plates at the start of the
       1870s.^[229] The mechanical production of dry photographic plates
       were invented by George Eastman who filed U.S. patent #226,503 on
       September 9, 1879 for (in his own words "An Improved Process for
       Preparing Gelatine Dry-Film Plates") which was issued to him on
       April 13, 1880.^[158]^[230]

   1879 Carton
     * A carton is the name of certain types of containers typically made
       from paperboard or cardboard. Many types of cartons are used in
       food packaging. Sometimes a carton is also called a box. The
       history of the carton goes as far back as 1879 when it was invented
       in a Brooklyn, New York factory. The inventor of the folded carton
       was Robert Gair. He cast a die-ruled, cut, and scored paperboard
       into a single impression of a folded carton. By 1896, the National
       Biscuit Company was the first to use cartons to package
       crackers.^[231]

   1879 Cash register
   An example of a cash register in Japan

   The cash register is a device for calculating and recording sales
   transactions. When a transaction was completed, the first cash
   registers used a bell that rang and the amount was noted on a large
   dial on the front of the machine. During each sale, a paper tape was
   punched with holes so that the merchant could keep track of sales.
   Known as the "Incorruptible Cashier", the mechanical cash register was
   invented and patented in 1879 by James Ritty of Dayton, Ohio. John H.
   Patterson bought Ritty's patent and his cash register company in
   1884.^[232]

   1880 Oil burner

   An oil burner is a heating device which burns fuel oil. The oil is
   directed under pressure through a nozzle to produce a fine spray, which
   is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced
   through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the oil
   burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed
   her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.^[233]

   1880 Candlepin bowling

   Candlepin bowling is a North American variation of bowling that is
   played primarily in the Canadian Maritime provinces, Quebec, Maine,
   Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. A candlepin bowling lane somewhat
   resembles lanes used in tenpin bowling. However, unlike tenpin bowling
   lanes that are flat, candlepin lanes are slightly depressed ahead of
   the pindeck. The candlepins themselves take on a cylindrical shape
   which are tapered at the tops and bottoms, thus giving them a
   resemblance to wax candles. In 1880, candlepin bowling was invented by
   Justin White of Worcester, Massachusetts.^[234]

   1881 Electric chair
     * Execution by electrocution is an execution method which the person
       being put to death is strapped to a specially built wooden chair
       and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. In 1881,
       Alfred Southwick witnessed an intoxicated man touch a live electric
       generator. After the man died quickly, Dr. Southwick concluded that
       electricity could be used as an alternative to hanging for
       executions. Southwick was a dentist who was accustomed to
       performing procedures on subjects in chairs, and so he designed an
       "electric chair". The first electric chair based on Southwick's
       design was made by Harold P. Brown and the first person to be
       executed via the electric chair was William Kemmler in New York's
       Auburn Prison on August 6, 1890.^[235]

   1881 Metal detector
     * Metal detectors use electromagnetic induction to detect metal. In
       1881, the Scots-American named Alexander Graham Bell invented the
       first metal detector as President James Garfield lay dying from a
       fatal gunshot wound. Despite an effort to locate the lodged bullet,
       Bell's invention proved to be unsuccessful as the metal detector
       was confused by the metal-framed bed which the assassinated
       president laid on.^[236]

   1881 Iron (electric)
     * An iron is a small appliance used to remove wrinkles from fabric.
       The electric iron was invented in 1881 and patented in 1882 by
       Henry W. Seely of New York. A second electric iron, a "cordless"
       one instead heated on a stand powered by electricity, was developed
       with his partner Dyer in 1883.^[237]

   1881 peristaltic pump
          A peristaltic pump was first patented in the United States by
          Eugene Allen in 1881 (U.S. Patent number 249285) for the
          transfusion of blood.

   1882 Fan (electric)
     * An electric fan contains an arrangement of blades usually powered
       by an electric motor in order to produce airflow for the purpose of
       creating comfort (particularly in the heat), ventilation, or
       exhaust. Between the years 1882 and 1886, New Orleans resident
       Schuyler Skaats Wheeler invented the first electric fan.^[238]

   1883 Salt water taffy
     * Salt water taffy is a variety of soft taffy. Despite the name, it
       does not contain sea water. The legend of how salt water taffy got
       its name is disputed. The most popular story, although unconfirmed,
       concerns a candy-store owner, David Bradley, whose shop was flooded
       during a major storm in 1883. His entire stock of taffy was soaked
       with salty Atlantic Ocean water. When a young girl came into his
       shop and asked if he had any taffy for sale, he is said to have
       offered some "salt water taffy". At the time it was a joke, because
       all his taffy had been soaked with salt water, but the girl was
       delighted, she bought the candy and proudly walked down to the
       beach to show her friends. Bradley's mother was in the back and
       heard the exchange. She loved the name and so Salt Water Taffy was
       born.^[239]

   1883 Solar cell
   Solar panels at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada generating and
   absorbing the sun's natural light

   A solar cell is any device that directly converts the energy in light
   into electrical energy through the process of photovoltaics. Although
   French physicist Antoine-César Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic
   effect much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to
   Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883, who
   used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer
   of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another
   American named Russell Ohl. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American
   researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin
   essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through
   their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing
   them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electrical
   current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.^[240]

   1883 Thermostat

   A thermostat is a device for regulating the temperature of a system so
   that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint
   temperature. The thermostat does this by switching heating or cooling
   devices on or off, or regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as
   needed, to maintain the correct temperature. The thermostat was
   invented in 1883 by Warren S. Johnson.^[241]

   1884 Machine gun
   Maxim's machine gun on display at the Military Museum of Finland

   The machine gun is defined as a fully automatic firearm, usually
   designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an
   ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. The world's first true
   machine gun, the Maxim gun, was invented in 1884 by the American
   inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, who devised a recoil power of the
   previously fired bullet to reload rather than the crude method of a
   manually operated, hand-cranked firearm.^[162]^[242] With the ability
   to fire 750 rounds per minute, Maxim's other great innovation was the
   use of water cooling to reduce overheating. Maxim's gun was widely
   adopted and derivative designs were used on all sides during World War
   I.^[243]

   1884 Dissolvable pill

   A dissolvable pill is any pharmaceutical in tablet form that is
   ingested orally, which are crushable and able to dissolve in the
   stomach unlike tablets with hard coatings. The dissolvable pill was
   invented in 1884 by William E. Upjohn.^[244]

   1884 Skyscraper

   A skyscraper is a tall building that uses a steel-frame construction.
   After the Great Fire of 1871, Chicago had become a magnet for daring
   experiments in architecture as one of those was the birth of the
   skyscraper. The edifice known as the world's first skyscraper was the
   10-story Home Insurance Company Building built in 1884. It was designed
   by the Massachusetts-born architect William Le Baron Jenney.^[245]

   1885 Popcorn machine
     * A popcorn machine, also called a popcorn maker, is a device used to
       pop popcorn. Commercial popcorn machines are usually found in movie
       theaters and carnivals, producing popcorn of the oil-popped type,
       which has approximately 45% of its calories derived from fat. The
       first commercial popcorn machine was invented by Chicago resident
       Charles Cretors in 1885. His business that he founded, C. Cretors &
       Company, still to this day manufactures popcorn machines and other
       specialty equipment.^[246]

   1885 Photographic film
     * Photographic film is a sheet of material coated with a
       photosensitive emulsion. When the emulsion is sufficiently exposed
       to light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays
       and is developed it forms an image. George Eastman and his company,
       Eastman Kodak, invented the first flexible photographic film as
       well as the invention of roll film in 1885. This original "film"
       used a paper carrier. The first transparent plastic film was
       produced in 1889. Before this, glass photographic plates were used,
       which were far more expensive and cumbersome, although of better
       quality due to their size. Early film was made from flammable
       nitrocellulose with camphor as a plasticizer.^[247]

   1885 Mixer (cooking)
     * An electric mixer is a kitchen appliance used for whipping,
       beating, and folding food ingredients. It typically consists of a
       handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor, which
       drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to
       be mixed. The first electric mixer was invented by Rufus M. Eastman
       in 1885.^[248] U.S. patent #330,829 for the first electric mixer
       was filed by Eastman on March 6, 1885 and issued on November 17,
       1885.^[249]

   1885 Fuel dispenser
   A man using a fuel dispenser by pumping gasoline into plastic fuel
   containers

   A fuel dispenser is used to pump gasoline, diesel, or other types of
   fuel into vehicles or containers. As the automobile was not invented
   yet, the gas pump was used for kerosene lamps and stoves. Sylvanus F.
   Bowser of Fort Wayne, Indiana invented the gasoline/petrol pump on
   September 5, 1885.^[250] Coincidentally, the term "bowser" is still
   often used in countries such as New Zealand and Australia as a
   reference to the fuel dispenser.^[251]

   1886 Filing cabinet (horizontal)

   A filing cabinet is a piece of office furniture used to store paper
   documents in file folders. It is an enclosure for drawers in which
   items are stored. On November 2, 1886, Henry Brown patented his
   invention of a "receptacle for storing and preserving papers". This was
   a fire and accident safe container made of forged metal, which could be
   sealed with a lock and key. It was special in that it kept the papers
   separated.^[252]

   1886 Telephone directory

   A telephone directory is a listing of telephone subscribers in a
   geographical area or subscribers to services provided by the
   organization that publishes the directory. R. H. Donnelley created the
   first official telephone directory which was referred to as the Yellow
   Pages in 1886.^[253]

   1887 Screen door

   A screen door can refer to a hinged storm door (cold climates) or
   hinged screen door (warm climates) covering an exterior door; or a
   screened sliding door used with sliding glass doors. In any case, the
   screen door incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from
   entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces,
   while allowing for air, light, and views. The screen door was invented
   in 1887 by Hannah Harger.^[254]

   1887 Gramophone record
   A selection of gramophone records and an album

   A gramophone record, commonly known as a record, or a vinyl record, is
   an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an
   inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the
   periphery and ends near the center of the disc. Ever since Thomas
   Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, it produced distorted sound
   because of gravity's pressure on the playing stylus. In response, Emile
   Berliner invented a new medium for recording and listening to sound in
   1887 in the form of a horizontal disc, originally known as the
   "platter".^[255]

   1887 Slot machine

   A slot machine is a casino gambling machine. Due to the vast number of
   possible wins with the original poker card based game, it proved
   practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable
   of making an automatic pay-out for all possible winning combinations.
   The first "one-armed bandit" was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San
   Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with
   three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols – horseshoes,
   diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the
   machine its name.^[256]

   1887 Softball

   As a bat-and-ball team sport, softball is a variant of baseball. The
   difference between the two sports is that softball uses larger balls
   and requires a smaller playing field. Beginning as an indoor game in
   Chicago, softball was invented in 1887 by George Hancock.^[257]

   1887 Comptometer
     * A comptometer is a mechanical or electro-mechanical adding machine.
       The comptometer was the first adding device to be driven solely by
       the action of pressing keys, which are arranged in an array of
       vertical and horizontal columns. Although the comptometer was
       designed primarily for adding, it could also do division,
       multiplication, and subtraction. Special comptometers with varying
       key arrays were produced for a variety of purposes, including
       calculating currencies, time and Imperial measures of weight. The
       original design was invented and patented in 1887 by Dorr
       Felt.^[258]

   1888 Induction motor
   Examples of modern induction motors

   An induction motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric
   current in the rotor needed to produce torque is induced by
   electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding
   instead of using mechanical commutation (brushes) that caused sparking
   in earlier electric motors. They are also self-starting. The
   Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla explored the idea of using a
   rotating magnetic induction field principle, using it in his invention
   of a poly-phase induction motor using alternating current which he
   received a patent for on May 1, 1888.^[259]^[260] The rights to Tesla's
   invention were licensed by George Westinghouse for the AC power system
   his company was developing.

   The induction motor Tesla patented in the U.S. is considered to been an
   independent invention since the Europe Italian physicist Galileo
   Ferraris published a paper on a rotating magnetic field based induction
   motor on 11 March 1888, almost two months before Tesla was granted his
   patent.^[261]^[262]^[263]^[264] A working model of the Ferraris
   inductionmotor may have been demonstrated at the University of Turin as
   early as 1885.^[265]^[266]^[267]

   1888 Kinetoscope

   The Kinetoscope was an early motion picture exhibition device. It was
   designed for films to be viewed individually through the window of a
   cabinet housing its components. The Kinetoscope introduced the basic
   approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection
   before the advent of video, creating the illusion of movement by
   conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a
   light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual
   terms by Thomas Alva Edison in 1888, his invention was largely
   developed by one of his assistants, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson,
   between 1889 and 1892.^[268]

   1888 Trolley pole
   An example of a trolley pole used in Japan

   A trolley pole is a tapered cylindrical pole of wood or metal placed in
   contact with an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley
   car. The trolley pole sits atop a sprung base on the roof of the
   trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the
   trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a
   Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the
   trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario was built
   in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways
   at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a
   pole system, there's no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright
   never filed or was issued a patent.^[269] Official credit for the
   invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, Frank
   J. Sprague, who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in
   1888.^[269] Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12 mile
   system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to
   great fanfare on February 12, 1888.^[270]

   1888 Drinking straw

   The drinking straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the
   mouth, usually a drink from one location to another. The first crude
   forms of drinking straws were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin
   Stone is the inventor of the drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a
   factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design
   because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on
   January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and
   wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw
   became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.^[271]

   1888 Stepping switch
   An example of a Strowger-type selector assembly

   In electrical controls, a stepping switch, also known as a stepping
   relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection
   to be connected to one of a number of possible output connections,
   under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for
   these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route
   telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on
   two axes (a Strowger switch). As the first automated telephone switch
   using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by
   Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on
   March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.^[272]

   1888 Revolving door

   A revolving door has three or four doors that hang on a center shaft
   and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In
   high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air
   pressure differentials. In order to address this problem, the revolving
   door was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented the revolving door on August 7,
   1888.^[273]

   1888 Ballpoint pen
   The tip of a ballpoint pen

   A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument with an internal ink reservoir
   and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber is filled with a viscous
   ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a
   small sphere. The first ballpoint pen is the creation of American
   leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which
   contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up his leather
   hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't
   a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged
   up.^[274]^[275]^[276] Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in
   the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888.^[277] However, it wasn't until
   1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved
   version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.^[276]

   1888 Telautograph

   The telautograph, an analog precursor to the modern fax machine,
   transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers at the sending
   station to stepping motors attached to a pen at the receiving station,
   thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing or signature made
   by sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a
   stationary sheet of paper. The telautograph's invention is attributed
   to Elisha Gray, who patented it in 1888.^[278]

   1888 Touch typing
     * Touch typing is typing on a keyboard without using the sense of
       sight to find the keys. Specifically, a touch typist will know
       their location on the keyboard through muscle memory. Touch typing
       typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row
       along the middle of the keyboard (the home row) and having them
       reach for other keys. Touch typing was invented in 1888 by Frank
       Edward McGurrin, a court stenographer from Salt Lake City,
       Utah.^[279]

   1888 Salisbury steak
     * Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of minced beef and
       other ingredients, which is shaped to resemble a steak, and is
       usually served with gravy or brown sauce. The Salisbury steak was
       invented in 1888 by American doctor and chemist James Salisbury,
       who prescribed his "meat cure" for such ailments like rheumatism,
       gout, colitis, and anemia.^[280]

   1889 Flexible flyer
   A boy atop a flexible flyer sled in 1945

   A flexible flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled with
   thin metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie
   on their stomach, allowing the possibility to descend a snowy slope
   feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push
   on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope
   attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in
   1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen.^[281] U.S. patent
   #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.^[282]

   1889 Payphone

   A payphone or pay phone is a public telephone, usually located in a
   stand-alone upright container such as a phone booth, with payment done
   by inserting money (usually coins), a credit or debit card, or a
   telephone card before the call is made. Pay telephone stations preceded
   the invention of the pay phone and existed as early as 1878. These
   stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who
   collected the money due after people made their calls. In 1889, the
   first coin-operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at
   a bank in Hartford, Connecticut. However, it was a "postpay" machine
   that only accepted coins deposited after the call was
   placed.^[283]^[284]
