   Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of chattel
   slavery that existed in the United States of America in the 18th and
   19th centuries. Slavery had been practiced in British North America
   from early colonial days, and was recognized in the Thirteen Colonies
   at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. When the United
   States was founded, even though some free persons of color were
   present, the status of slave was largely coincident with being of
   African descent, creating a system and legacy in which race played an
   influential role. After the Revolutionary War, abolitionist laws and
   sentiment gradually spread in the Northern states, while the rapid
   expansion of the cotton industry from 1800 led to the Southern states
   strongly identifying with slavery, and attempting to extend it into the
   new Western territories. The United States was polarized by slavery
   into slave and free states along the Mason-Dixon Line, which separated
   Maryland (slave) and Pennsylvania (free).

   Although the international slave trade was prohibited from 1808,
   internal slave-trading continued, and the slave population would
   eventually peak at four million before abolition.^[1]^[2]

   As the West opened up, the Southern states believed they needed to keep
   a balance between the numbers of slave and free states, in order to
   maintain a balance of power in Congress. The new territories acquired
   from Britain, France and Mexico were the subject of major political
   compromises. By 1850, the newly rich cotton-growing South was
   threatening to secede from the Union, and tensions continued to rise.
   With church ministers under pressure to preach slavery doctrine
   conforming to the local politics, the Baptist and Methodist churches
   split into regional organizations. When Abraham Lincoln won the 1860
   election on a platform of no new slave states, the South finally broke
   away to form the Confederacy. This marked the start of the Civil War,
   which caused a huge disruption of Southern life, with many slaves
   either escaping or being liberated by the Union armies. The war
   effectively ended slavery, before the Thirteenth Amendment (December
   1865) formally outlawed the institution throughout the United States.

Colonial America

   Main article: Slavery in the colonial United States

   In the early years of the Chesapeake Bay settlements, it was difficult
   to attract and retain laborers, and there was a high mortality
   rate.^[3] Most laborers came from Britain as indentured servants, who
   signed contracts of indenture to pay with work for their passage, their
   upkeep and training, usually on a farm, as the colonies were highly
   agricultural. These indentured servants were young people who intended
   to become permanent residents. Some masters treated them as well or as
   poorly as family members. In some cases, convicted criminals were
   transported to the colonies as indentured servants, rather than being
   imprisoned. Many Scots-Irish, Irish and Germans came in the 18th
   century. The indentured servants were not slaves. The planters found
   that the major problem with indentured servants was that many left
   after several years, just when they had become skilled and the most
   valuable workers. In addition, an improving economy in England in the
   late 17th and early 18th centuries meant that fewer workers chose to go
   to the colonies. Historians estimate that more than half of all white
   immigrants to the English colonies of North America during the 17th and
   18th centuries came as indentured servants. The number of indentured
   servants among immigrants was particularly high in the South.^[3]

   The first 19 or so Africans arrived ashore near the English colony of
   Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619, brought by Dutch traders who had seized
   them from a captured Spanish slave ship. The Spanish usually baptized
   slaves in Africa before embarking them. As English law considered
   baptized Christians exempt from slavery, these Africans were treated as
   indentured servants who joined about 1,000 English indentured servants
   already in the colony. They were freed after a prescribed period and
   given the use of land and supplies by their former masters. The
   historian Ira Berlin noted that what he called the "charter generation"
   was sometimes made up of mixed-race men who were indentured servants,
   and whose ancestry was African and Iberian. They were descendants of
   African women and Portuguese and Spanish men who worked in African
   ports as traders or facilitators in the slave trade. For example, like
   Anthony Johnson, who arrived in 1621 as an indentured servant, some
   Africans achieved freedom and became property owners. The
   transformation of the status of Africans from indentured servitude to
   slavery—whereby they could never leave—happened gradually. There were
   no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia's history. But, in 1640, a
   Virginia court sentenced John Punch to slavery after he attempted to
   flee his service.^[4] The two whites with whom he fled were only
   sentence to an additional year of their indenture, and three years
   service to the colony.^[5] This marked the first legal sanctioning of
   slavery in the English colonies and was one of the first legal
   distinctions made between Europeans and Africans.^[4]^[6]

   In 1654, John Casor, a black indentured servant, was the first man to
   be declared a slave in a civil case. He had claimed to an officer that
   his owner, free black colonist Anthony Johnson, had held him past his
   indenture term. A neighbor, Robert Parker told Johnson that if he did
   not release Casor, Parker would testify in court to this fact; which
   under local laws, may have resulted in Johnson losing some of his
   headright lands. Under duress, Johnson freed Casor, who entered into a
   seven years' indenture with Parker. Feeling cheated, Johnson sued
   Parker to repossess Casor. A Northampton County court ruled for
   Johnson, declaring that Parker illegally was detaining Casor from his
   rightful master who legally held him "for the duration of his
   life".^[9]

   Since persons with African origins were not English subjects by birth,
   they were considered foreigners and generally outside English common
   law. Elizabeth Key Grinstead, a mixed-race woman, successfully gained
   her freedom and that of her son in the Virginia courts in 1656 by
   making her case as the daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. She
   was also a baptized Christian. Her attorney and her son's father was
   also an English subject, which may have helped her case.^[10]

   Shortly after the Elizabeth Key trial and similar challenges, in 1662
   Virginia passed a law adopting the principle of partus sequitur ventrum
   (called partus, for short), stating that any children of an enslaved
   mother would take her status and be born into slavery, regardless if
   the father were a freeborn Englishman. This was a reversal of common
   law practice, which ruled that children of English subjects took the
   status of the father. The change institutionalized the power
   relationships between slaveowners and slave women, freed the white men
   from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support
   their mixed-race children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of
   mixed-race children and miscegenation to within the slave quarters.

   The Virginia Slave codes of 1705 further defined as slaves those people
   imported from nations that were not Christian, as well as Native
   Americans who were sold to colonists by other Native Americans or
   captured by Europeans during village raids.^[11] This established the
   basis for the legal enslavement of any non-Christian foreigner.

   In 1735, the Georgia Trustees enacted a law to prohibit slavery in the
   new colony, which had been established in 1733 to enable the "worthy
   poor" as well as persecuted European Protestants to have a new start.
   Slavery was then legal in the other twelve English colonies, and
   neighboring South Carolina had become particularly dedicated to mass
   enslavement of an African labor force. The Georgia Trustees wanted to
   eliminate the risk of slave rebellions and make Georgia better able to
   defend against attacks from the Spanish to the south, who offered
   freedom to escaped slaves. James Edward Oglethorpe was the driving
   force behind the colony, and the only trustee to reside in Georgia. He
   opposed slavery on moral grounds as well as for pragmatic reasons, and
   vigorously defended the ban on slavery against fierce opposition from
   Carolina slave merchants and land speculators.^[12]^[13]^[14]

   The Protestant Scottish highlanders who settled what is now Darien,
   Georgia added a moral anti-slavery argument, which was rare at the
   time, in their 1739 "Petition of the Inhabitants of New
   Inverness".^[15] By 1750 Georgia authorized slavery in the state
   because they had been unable to secure enough indentured servants as
   laborers, since economic conditions in England began to improve in the
   first half of the 18th century.

   During most of the British colonial period, slavery existed in all the
   colonies. People enslaved in the North typically worked as house
   servants, artisans, laborers and craftsmen, with the greater number in
   cities. The South depended on an agricultural economy, and it had a
   significantly higher number and proportion of slaves in the population,
   as its commodity crops were labor intensive.^[16] Early on, slaves in
   the South worked primarily in agriculture, on farms and plantations
   growing indigo, rice, and tobacco; cotton became a major crop after the
   1790s. The invention of the cotton gin enabled the cultivation of
   short-staple cotton in a wide variety of areas, leading to the
   development of the Deep South as cotton country. Tobacco was very labor
   intensive, as was rice cultivation.^[17] In South Carolina in 1720,
   about 65% of the population consisted of slaves.^[18] Planters (defined
   by historians as those who held 20 slaves or more) used slaves to
   cultivate commodity crops. They also worked in the artisanal trades on
   large plantations and in many southern cities. Backwoods subsistence
   farmers, the later wave of settlers in the 18th century who settled
   along the Appalachian Mountains and backcountry, seldom owned slaves.

   Some of the British colonies attempted to abolish the international
   slave trade, fearing that the importation of new Africans would be
   disruptive. Virginia bills to that effect were vetoed by the British
   Privy Council. Rhode Island forbade the import of slaves in 1774. All
   of the colonies except Georgia had banned or limited the African slave
   trade by 1786; Georgia did so in 1798. Some of these laws were later
   repealed.^[19]

   A total of about 600,000 slaves were imported into the Thirteen
   Colonies and the U.S, constituting 5% of the twelve million slaves
   brought from Africa to the Americas. The great majority of African
   slaves were transported to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to
   Brazil. As life expectancy was short, their numbers had to be
   continually replenished. Life expectancy was much higher in the U.S.
   and the slave population began to reproduce; enslaved peoples' numbers
   grew rapidly, reaching 4 million by the 1860 Census. From 1770 until
   1860, the rate of natural growth of North American enslaved people was
   much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was
   nearly twice as rapid as that of England.^[20]

   Slavery in Great Britain had never been authorized by statute. In 1772
   it was made unenforceable at common law by a decision of Lord
   Mansfield, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, but this decision did not
   govern the Atlantic slave trade, nor apply in the colonies, where the
   overwhelming majority of British slaves lived. A number of cases for
   emancipation were presented to the British courts. Numerous runaways
   hoped to reach Britain where they hoped to be free. The slaves' belief
   that King George III was for them and against their masters rose as
   tensions increased before the American Revolution; some colonial
   slaveholders feared that rebelling against the Crown might trigger a
   British-inspired slave revolt.

   In early 1775 Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia, wrote to Lord
   Dartmouth of his intent to free slaves in case of rebellion.^[23] On
   November 7, 1775, Lord Dunmore issued Lord Dunmore's Proclamation which
   declared martial law^[24] and promised freedom for any slaves of
   American patriots who would leave their masters and join the royal
   forces. Slaves owned by Loyalist masters, however, were unaffected by
   Dunmore's Proclamation. Of slaves owned by Rebel masters, approximately
   1500 did so; most died of disease before they could do any fighting.
   Only 300 made it to freedom in Britain.^[25]

Revolutionary War and freedom

   Many Northern states moved towards emancipation during the
   Revolutionary Era. The 1777 Constitution of the Vermont Republic banned
   slavery, freeing males over the age of 21 and women over the age of 18.
   Pennsylvania in 1780 passed An Act for the Gradual Abolition of
   Slavery, which declared all children born after the act to be free, and
   Massachusetts, via the Quock Walker Case of 1783, immediately ended
   slavery in the state. In response to the British offer of freedom for
   slaves owned by rebel masters, tens of thousands of slaves who were
   owned by Rebel masters tried to enlist in the British army when it
   controlled an area. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000
   slaves (30% of the total enslaved population) fled, migrated or died
   during the disruption of the war. Throughout the South, losses of
   slaves were high, with many due to escapes.^[26] Slaves escaped
   throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic, joining the British who
   had occupied New York. In the closing months of the war, the British
   evacuated 20,000 freedmen from major coastal cities, transporting more
   than 3,000 for resettlement in Nova Scotia, with others taken to the
   Caribbean islands, and some to England. Along with these freedmen, the
   British also transported the slaves of Loyalists. For example, over
   5,000 enslaved Africans owned by Loyalists were transported in 1782
   from Savannah to Jamaica and St. Augustine. Similarly, over half of the
   Blacks evacuated out of Charleston to the West Indies and Florida by
   the British in 1782 were slaves owned by White Loyalists.

   In the 18th century, Britain had become the world's largest slave
   trader. During the revolutionary era, all its rebellious colonies
   banned or suspended the international slave trade. This was done for a
   variety of economic, political, and moral reasons depending on the
   colony. The trade was later reopened in South Carolina and
   Georgia.^[27]

Constitution of the United States

   The Constitution of the United States was drafted in 1787, and included
   several provisions regarding slavery. Section 9 of Article I forbade
   the Federal government, from banning the "importation" of persons that
   an individual state's laws considered "proper to admit" until January
   1, 1808, though a tax of ten dollars each was allowed. Article V
   prohibited amending those portions of Section 9 before 1808. By
   prohibiting Federal banning of the slave trade for two decades, Article
   V effectively protected the trade until 1808, giving the States 20
   years to resolve this issue. During that time, planters in states of
   the Lower South imported tens of thousands of slaves, more than during
   any previous two decades in colonial history.^[28]

   As further protection for slavery, the delegates approved Section 2 of
   Article IV, which prohibited states from freeing slaves who fled to
   them from another state, and required the return of chattel property to
   owners.

   In a section negotiated by James Madison of Virginia, Section 2 of
   Article I designated "other persons" (slaves) to be added to the total
   of the state's free population, at the rate of three-fifths of their
   total number, to establish the state's official population for the
   purposes of apportionment of Congressional representation and federal
   taxation.^[29] This increased the power of southern states in Congress
   for decades, affecting national policies and legislation.^[30] The
   planter elite dominated the southern Congressional delegations and the
   United States presidency for nearly 50 years.^[30]

1790 to 1850

   Further information: Slave and free states

   While the Constitution protected the slave trade until 1808 in the
   national Congress, in the first two decades of the postwar era, state
   legislatures in both the North and South made decisions to free many
   slaves, resulting in a dramatic rise in the number and proportion of
   free blacks in the United States by 1810. Most free blacks were in the
   North, but in the Upper South, the proportion went from less than one
   percent of all blacks to more than 10 percent, even as the number of
   slaves was increasing.^[31] After 1810, the cotton gin made the
   cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable, as it could be
   processed, and the Deep South was developed for widespread cotton
   cultivation, dramatically increasing the demand for slaves in the
   southern United States. While it could not prohibit the import slave
   trade until 1808, the third Congress regulated it in 1794, by
   prohibition on the use of ports for ship building and outfitting for
   the trade in the Slave Trade Act. Subsequent acts in 1800 and 1803,
   further sought to discourage the trade by limiting investment in import
   trading and prohibiting importation into states that had abolished
   slavery.^[32] The final Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was
   adopted in 1807 to go into effect in 1808.

   The protections afforded slavery in the Constitution strengthened the
   political power of southern representatives, and the southern economy
   had links nationwide. As the historian James Oliver Horton noted,
   slaveholders and the commodity crops of the South had a strong
   influence on United States politics and economy; New York City's
   economy was closely tied to the South through shipping and
   manufacturing, for instance. By 1822 half of its exports were related
   to cotton.^[33] Horton said,

     in the 72 years between the election of George Washington and the
     election of Abraham Lincoln, 50 of those years [had] a slaveholder
     as president of the United States, and, for that whole period of
     time, there was never a person elected to a second term who was not
     a slaveholder.^[30]

Northern abolition

   During and after the American Revolutionary War, between 1777 and 1804,
   anti-slavery laws or constitutions were passed in every state north of
   the Ohio River and the Mason-Dixon Line. By 1810, 75 percent of all
   African Americans in the North were free. By 1840, virtually all
   African Americans in the North were free.^[34] Vermont's 1777
   constitution made no allowance for slavery. In Massachusetts, slavery
   was successfully challenged in court in 1783 in a freedom suit by Quock
   Walker as being in contradiction to the state's new constitution of
   1780 providing for equality of men. Freed slaves were subject to racial
   segregation in the North, and it took decades for some states to extend
   the franchise to them.^[35]

   Most northern states passed legislation for gradual abolition. As a
   result of this gradualist approach, New York did not free its last
   slaves until 1829, Rhode Island had five slaves still listed in the
   1840 census, Pennsylvania's last slaves were freed in 1847, Connecticut
   did not completely abolish slavery until 1848, and slavery was not
   completely lifted in New Hampshire and New Jersey until the nationwide
   emancipation in 1865.^[36]

   The principal organized bodies to advocate these reforms in the north
   were the Pennsylvania Abolition Society and the New York Manumission
   Society. The emancipation of slaves in the North led to the growth in
   the population of northern free blacks, from several hundreds in the
   1770s to nearly 50,000 by 1810.^[37]

   Through the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 under the Congress of the
   Confederation, slavery was prohibited in the territories northwest of
   the Ohio River (Existing slaves in the Territory were not freed for
   years, although they could no longer be sold). That was a compromise,
   as Thomas Jefferson's original proposal in 1784 to end slavery in all
   the territories lost in Congress by one vote. The territories south of
   the Ohio River (and Missouri) had authorized slavery.^[38] Yankees and
   Northerners predominated in the westward movement into the Midwestern
   territory after the American Revolution; as the states were organized,
   they voted to prohibit slavery in their constitutions when they
   achieved statehood: Ohio in 1803, Indiana in 1816, and Illinois in
   1818. What developed into a Northern block of free states united into
   one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti-slavery
   culture. The exceptions were areas along the Ohio River settled by
   Southerners, for instance, the southern portions of states such as
   Indiana, Ohio and Illinois, leading those areas generally to share in
   Southern culture and positions.

Post-revolution Southern manumissions

   Although Virginia, Maryland and Delaware were slave states, their
   legislatures made manumission easier following the Revolution. Quaker
   and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their
   slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose
   dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in
   the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion
   of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from
   less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810.^[31] In
   Delaware, nearly 75 percent of blacks were free by 1810.^[39]

   In the US as a whole, by 1810 the number of free blacks reached
   186,446, or 13.5 percent of all blacks.^[34] After that period, few
   were freed, as the development of cotton plantations featuring
   short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for
   slaves in the domestic slave trade.^[40]

Internal slave trade and forced migration

   Movement of slaves between 1790 and 1860

   The growing demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west
   in search of suitable land. In addition, the invention of the cotton
   gin in 1793 enabled more economic processing of short-staple cotton,
   which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention
   revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the
   quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. The mechanization
   could efficiently handle short-staple cotton, which could be grown in
   more places than the long-staple cotton of the Low Country. Results
   were the explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep
   South and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it.^[41]
   Manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.^[42] At the end of
   the War of 1812, fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced
   nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to
   600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000.

   By 1815, the internal slave trade had become a major economic activity
   in the United States; it lasted until the 1860s.^[43] Between 1830 and
   1840 nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines.^[43] In the
   1850s over 193,000 were transported, and historians estimate nearly one
   million in total took part in the forced migration of this new Middle
   Passage. By 1860 the slave population in the United States had reached
   4 million.^[43] Of all 1,515,605 free families in the fifteen slave
   states in 1860, nearly 400,000 held slaves (roughly one in four, or
   25%),^[44] amounting to 8% of all American families.^[45]

   As the internal slave trade became a dominant feature of American
   slavery, individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added
   to the earlier settlers' previous glossing over of origins and
   combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost all
   knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa, as most had families who
   had been in the United States for many generations.^[43]

   This boom in agricultural economies in the Deep South resulted in a
   large westward and southward forced migration of slaves. Historians
   have estimated that one million slaves were moved westward and
   southward between 1790 and 1860. Most of the slaves originated in
   Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, where changes in agriculture
   decreased demand for slaves. Before 1810, primary destinations were
   Kentucky and Tennessee, but after 1810 Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
   Louisiana and Texas received the most slaves.^[46] Kentucky and
   Tennessee became exporting states.

   The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration the "Second
   Middle Passage", because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the
   Middle Passage (the name given to the transportation of slaves from
   Africa to North America). This large migration of slaves broke up many
   families and caused much hardship. The historian Peter Kolchin wrote,
   "By breaking up existing families and forcing slaves to relocate far
   from everyone and everything they knew," this migration "replicated (if
   on a reduced level) many of [the] horrors" of the Atlantic slave
   trade.^[47] Characterizing it as the "central event” in the life of a
   slave between the American Revolution and the Civil War, Berlin wrote
   that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they
   or their families would be involuntarily moved, "the massive
   deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free."^[48]

   In the 1830s, almost 300,000 slaves were transported, with Alabama and
   Mississippi receiving 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and
   1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In
   the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Michael
   Tadman wrote in Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in
   the Old South (1989) that 60–70% of interregional migrations were the
   result of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a
   30% chance of being sold south by 1860.^[49] The death rate for the
   slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South
   was much less than that of the captives shipped across the Atlantic
   Ocean, but mortality was higher than the normal death rate.
   Slave trader's business in Atlanta, Georgia, 1864.

   Slave traders transported two-thirds of the slaves who moved west.^[50]
   Only a minority moved with their families and existing master. Slave
   traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave
   families; in the early years, planters demanded only young male slaves
   for heavy labor. Later, in the interest of creating a "self-reproducing
   labor force", planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women.
   Berlin wrote:

     The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South
     outside the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its
     employment of modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The
     slave trade industry developed its own unique language, with terms
     such as "prime hands, bucks, breeding wenches, and "fancy girls"
     coming into common use.^[51]

   The expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the
   "economic revival of once depressed seaboard states" as demand
   accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale.^[52]

   Some traders moved their "chattels" by sea, with Norfolk to New Orleans
   being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk
   overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as Louisville
   on the Ohio River, and Natchez on the Mississippi. Traders created
   regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards, and
   warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition,
   other vendors provided clothes, food, and supplies for slaves. As the
   trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin
   concluded, "In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional
   centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern
   society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched."^[53]

   1853

   Once the trip ended, slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly
   different from most labor in the Upper South. Clearing trees and
   starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work. A
   combination of inadequate nutrition, bad water, and exhaustion from
   both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and
   produced casualties. New plantations were located at rivers' edges for
   ease of transportation and travel. Mosquitoes and other environmental
   challenges spread disease, which took the lives of many slaves. They
   had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their
   previous homes. The death rate was so high that, in the first few years
   of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness, some planters preferred
   whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own.^[54]

   The harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led
   owners and overseers to rely on violence for control. Many of the
   slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the
   "sunrise-to-sunset gang labor" required by their new life. Slaves were
   driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or wheat
   back east. Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality
   of their lives by raising their own livestock or tending vegetable
   gardens, for either their own consumption or trade, as they could in
   the east.^[55]

   In Louisiana, French colonists had established sugar cane plantations
   and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop. After the Louisiana
   Purchase in 1803, Americans entered the state and joined the sugar
   cultivation. Between 1810 and 1830, planters bought slaves from the
   North and the number of slaves increased from less than 10,000 to more
   than 42,000. Planters preferred young males, who represented two-thirds
   of the slave purchases. Dealing with sugar cane was even more
   physically demanding than growing cotton. The largely young, unmarried
   male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners
   “especially savage.”^[56]

   New Orleans became nationally important as a slave market and port, as
   slaves were shipped from there upriver by steamboat to plantations on
   the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped
   downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, it had the largest
   slave market in North America. It became the wealthiest and the
   fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and
   associated businesses.^[57] The trading season was from September to
   May, after the harvest.^[58]

Treatment

   Main article: Treatment of slaves in the United States

   The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on
   conditions, times and places. Treatment was generally characterized by
   brutality, degradation, and inhumanity. Whippings, executions, and
   rapes were commonplace.^[citation needed] According to Adalberto
   Aguirre, there were 1,161 slaves executed in the U.S. between the 1790s
   and 1850s.^[59] Exceptions existed to virtually every generalization;
   for instance, there were slaves who employed white workers, slave
   doctors who treated upper-class white patients, and slaves who rented
   out their labor.^[60] After 1820, in response to the inability to
   import new slaves from Africa, some slaveholders improved the living
   conditions of their slaves, to influence them not to attempt
   escape.^[61]
   Peter or Gordon, a whipped Louisiana^[62] slave, photo taken at Baton
   Rouge, Louisiana, 1863; the guilty overseer was fired.^[63]

   The colonies and states generally denied slaves the opportunity to
   learn to read or write, to protect against their forming aspirations
   that could lead to escape or rebellion.^[64] Some slaves learned from
   planters' children, or from free laborers, while working alongside
   them.

   Medical care for slaves, which was limited in terms of medical
   knowledge available to anyone, was generally provided by other slaves
   or by slaveholders' family members. Many slaves possessed medical
   skills needed to tend to each other, and used many folk remedies
   brought from Africa. They also developed new remedies based on American
   plants and herbs.^[65]

   Some states prohibited religious gatherings of slaves, particularly
   following incidents such as Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831. Planters
   feared that group meetings would facilitate communication and may lead
   to rebellion.^[66]

   According to Andrew Fede, a master could be held criminally liable for
   killing a slave only if the slave he killed was "completely submissive
   and under the master's absolute control."^[67] For example, in 1791 the
   North Carolina legislature defined the willful killing of a slave as
   criminal murder, unless done in resisting or under moderate
   correction.^[68]

   Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning,
   mutilation, branding, and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted
   in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes
   abuse was carried out simply to re-assert the dominance of the master
   or overseer over the slave.^[69] Treatment was usually harsher on large
   plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by
   absentee slaveholders; in contrast with small slave-owning families,
   where the closer relationship between the owners and slaves sometimes
   resulted in a more humane environment.^[70] William Wells Brown, who
   escaped and became a fugitive slave, reported that on one plantation,
   slave-men were required to pick 80 pounds-per-day of cotton, while
   women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed in his or
   her quota, they were given lashes of the whip for each pound they were
   short. The whipping post stood right next to the cotton scales.^[71]

   Historian Lawrence M. Friedman wrote: "Ten Southern codes made it a
   crime to mistreat a slave. ... Under the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825
   (art. 192), if a master was “convicted of cruel treatment,” the judge
   could order the sale of the mistreated slave, presumably to a better
   master."^[72]

   Because of the power relationships of the institution, slave women in
   the United States were at high risk for rape and sexual
   abuse.^[73]^[74] Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks, and
   some died resisting. Others carried psychological and physical scars
   from the attacks.^[75] Sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a
   patriarchal Southern culture which treated black women as property or
   chattel.^[74] Southern culture strongly policed against sexual
   relations between white women and black men on the purported grounds of
   racial purity but, before the late 18th century, the many mixed-race
   slaves and slave children showed that white men had often taken
   advantage of slave women.^[74] Wealthy planter widowers, notably such
   as John Wayles and his son-in-law Thomas Jefferson, took slave women as
   concubines; each had six children with his partner: Elizabeth Hemings
   and her daughter Sally Hemings (the half-sister of Jefferson's late
   wife), respectively. Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble, wives of
   planters, wrote about this issue in the antebellum South in the decades
   before the Civil War. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as
   house servants or favored artisans because they were their children or
   other relatives.^[76]

   While slaves' living conditions were poor by modern standards, Robert
   Fogel argued that all workers, free or slave, during the first half of
   the 19th century were subject to hardship.^[77]

Slave codes

   Main article: Slave codes

   To help regulate the relationship between slave and owner, including
   legal support for keeping the slave as property, slave codes were
   established.

   While each state had its own slave code, many concepts were shared
   throughout the slave states.^[78] According to the slave codes,
   teaching a slave to read or write was illegal, although it often took
   place as children taught each other.

   Even though slave codes had many common features, each state had
   specific codes or variations that suited the laws in that region. For
   example in Alabama, slaves were not allowed to leave the premises of
   the owner without written consent, nor were slaves allowed to trade
   goods among themselves. In Virginia, slaves were not permitted to drink
   in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings. In
   Ohio, an emancipated slave was prohibited from returning to the state
   in which he or she had been enslaved. Slaves were not permitted to
   carry firearms in any of the slave states.

   The code for the District of Columbia defined a slave as "a human
   being, who is by law deprived of his or her liberty for life, and is
   the property of another."^[79]

Abolitionist movement

   clash of forces in Bleeding Kansas

          Main article: Abolitionism in the United States. See also
          Abolition of slavery timeline, List of notable opponents of
          slavery

   As noted above, soon after the Revolutionary War, northern states began
   to abolish slavery. Many states, including southern ones, passed laws
   prohibiting the importation of slaves to end the transatlantic slave
   trade.

   After Great Britain and the United States outlawed the international
   slave trade in 1807 and 1808 respectively, the British West Africa
   Squadron's slave trade suppression activities began in 1808. They were
   assisted by forces from the United States Navy, starting in 1820. With
   the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the relationship with Britain was
   formalised, and they jointly ran the Africa Squadron.^[80]

   Throughout the first half of the 19th century, abolitionism, a movement
   to end slavery, grew in strength throughout the United States; most
   abolitionist societies and supporters were in the North. This struggle
   took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners, who
   profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. Slavery was
   entwined with the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping
   and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic
   interests in slavery, as in some other major cities in the North.

   Slaveholders began to refer to slavery as the "peculiar institution" to
   differentiate it from other examples of forced labor. They justified it
   as less cruel than the free labor of the North.
   Henry Clay (1777–1852), one of three founders of the American
   Colonization Society, the vehicle for returning black Americans to
   greater freedom in Africa, founding Liberia.^[81]

   In the early part of the 19th century, a variety of organizations were
   founded that advocated moving black people from the United States to
   locations where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed
   colonization in Africa, while others advocated emigration. During the
   1820s and 1830s, the American Colonization Society (ACS) was the
   primary organization for proposals to "return" black Americans to
   Africa.^[81] The ACS was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders,
   who disagreed on the issue of slavery but found common ground in
   support of "repatriation". Most black Americans did not want to
   emigrate; rather, they wanted full rights in the United States, where
   they were native born, often for generations.

   In 1822 the ACS established the colony of Liberia.^[82] It assisted
   thousands of former African-American slaves and free blacks (with
   legislated limits) to emigrate there from the United States. Many white
   people saw this as preferable to emancipation in the United States.
   Henry Clay, one of the founders, said that blacks faced

     unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could
     amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable,
     therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population
     of the country, to drain them off.^[83]

   The slaveholder argued that it would be better for blacks to emigrate
   to Africa.^[83] Slaveholders opposed freedom for blacks, but saw
   "repatriation" as a way of avoiding rebellions.^[81]

   After 1830, William Lloyd Garrison worked for abolition by tying it to
   religion as a personal sin. He demanded the owners repent and start the
   process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness on the
   part of some southerners, who pointed to the long history of slavery
   among cultures. A few abolitionists, such as John Brown, favored the
   use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves. Most tried to
   raise public support for changed laws and to use the legal system.

High demand and smuggling

   1850

   The United States Constitution, adopted in 1787, prevented Congress
   from completely banning the importation of slaves until 1808, although
   Congress did regulate against it in the Slave Trade Act of 1794, and in
   subsequent Acts in 1800 and 1803.^[32] Knowing the trade would end, in
   the eight years from 1800 until December 31, 1807, Georgia and South
   Carolina reopened their trade and imported about 100,000 enslaved
   Africans into the country. Numerous states individually passed laws
   against importing slaves after the Revolution.

   By January 1, 1808, when Congress banned further imports, only South
   Carolina was still importing slaves. Congress allowed continued trade
   only in slaves who were descendants of those currently in the United
   States. The domestic slave trade was allowed, and it became more
   profitable than ever with the development of the Deep South for cotton
   and sugar crops. In addition, US citizens could participate in the
   international slave trade and the outfitting of ships for that trade.
   Slavery in the United States became, more or less, self-sustaining by
   natural increase among the current slaves and their descendants.

   Despite the ban, slave imports continued, if on a smaller scale, with
   smugglers continuing to bring in slaves past U.S. Navy patrols to South
   Carolina, and overland from Texas and Florida, both under Spanish
   control.^[84] Congress increased the punishment associated with
   importing slaves, classifying it in 1820 as an act of piracy, with
   smugglers subject to harsh penalties, including death if caught. After
   that, "it is unlikely that more than 10,000 [slaves] were successfully
   landed in the United States."^[85] Because of the high market demand,
   some smuggling of slaves into the United States continued until just
   before the start of the Civil War.

War of 1812

   During the War of 1812, British Royal Navy commanders of the blockading
   fleet, based at the Bermuda dockyard, were instructed to offer freedom
   to defecting American slaves, as the Crown had during the Revolutionary
   War. Thousands of escaped slaves went over to the Crown with their
   families. Men were recruited into the Corps of Colonial Marines on
   occupied Tangier Island, in the Chesapeake Bay.

   The freedmen fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign,
   including the attack on Washington D.C. and the Louisiana Campaign.
   Seven hundred.^[citation needed] of these ex-marines were granted land
   (they reportedly organised themselves in villages along the lines of
   their military companies). Many other freed American slaves were
   recruited directly into existing West Indian regiments, or newly
   created British Army units^[citation needed] The British later
   resettled a few thousand freed slaves at Nova Scotia.

   Slaveholders, primarily in the South, had considerable "loss of
   property" as tens of thousands of slaves^[citation needed] escaped to
   British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The
   planters' complacency about slave "contentment" was shocked by seeing
   that slaves would risk so much to be free.^[86] Afterwards, when some
   freed slaves had been settled at Bermuda, slaveholders such as Major
   Pierce Butler of South Carolina tried to persuade them to return to the
   United States, to no avail.

   The Americans protested that Britain's failure to return all slaves
   violated the Treaty of Ghent. After arbitration by the Tsar of Russia
   the British paid $1,204,960^[87] in damages to Washington, which
   reimbursed the slaveowners.^[88]

Religion

   Eastman Johnson's 1863 painting "The Lord is My Shepherd"

   Prior to the American Revolution, masters and revivalists spread
   Christianity to slave communities, supported by the Society for the
   Propagation of the Gospel. In the First Great Awakening, Baptists and
   Methodists from New England preached a message against slavery,
   encouraged masters to free their slaves, converted both slaves and free
   blacks, and gave them active roles in new congregations.^[89] The first
   black congregations were started in the South before the Revolution.

   Over the decades and with the growth of slavery throughout the South,
   Baptist and Methodist ministers gradually changed their messages to
   accommodate the institution. After 1830, white Southerners argued for
   the compatibility of Christianity and slavery, with a multitude of both
   Old and New Testament citations.^[90]

   Southern slaves generally attended their masters’ white churches, and
   often outnumbered the white congregants. They were usually permitted
   only to sit in the back or in the balcony. They listened to white
   preachers, who emphasized the appropriate behavior of slaves to keep in
   their place, and acknowledged the slave’s identity as both person and
   property.^[90] Preachers taught the master's responsibility and the
   concept of appropriate paternal treatment, using Christianity to
   improve conditions for slaves, and to treat them "justly and fairly”
   (Col. 4:1). This included having self-control, not disciplining under
   anger, not threatening, and ultimately fostering Christianity among
   their slaves by example.^[90]

   Slaves also created their own religious observances, meeting alone
   without the supervision of their white masters or ministers.
   Plantations that held groups of slaves numbering twenty, or more, lent
   the opportunity for nighttime meetings of one or several plantation
   slave populations.^[90] These congregations revolved around a singular
   preacher, often illiterate with limited knowledge of theology, who was
   marked by his personal piety and ability to foster a spiritual
   environment. One lasting influence of these secret congregations is the
   African-American spiritual.^[91]

Nat Turner and anti-literacy laws

   James Hopkinson's Plantation. Planting sweet potatoes. ca. 1862/63

   In 1831, a slave rebellion occurred in Southampton County, Virginia,
   organized by Nat Turner, a literate slave who claimed to have spiritual
   visions. He organized what became known as Nat Turner's Rebellion or
   the Southampton Insurrection. Turner and his followers killed nearly 60
   white inhabitants, mostly women and children, as many of the men in the
   area were attending a religious event in North Carolina.^[92]
   Eventually Turner was captured with 17 other rebels and subdued by the
   militia.^[92]

   Turner and his followers were hanged, and Turner's body was flayed. In
   a frenzy of fear and retaliation, the militia killed more than 100
   slaves who had not been involved in the rebellion. Planters whipped
   hundreds of innocent slaves to quell resistance.^[92] Across the South,
   harsh new laws were enacted to curtail the already limited rights of
   African Americans. New laws in Virginia prohibited blacks, free or
   slave, from practicing preaching, prohibited blacks from owning
   firearms, and forbade anyone to teach slaves how to read.^[92] Typical
   was the Virginia anti-literacy law against educating slaves, free
   blacks and children of whites and blacks, which specified heavy
   penalties both for student and teacher when slaves were educated.^[93]

Economics

   Slaves for sale, a scene in New Orleans.

   After Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin in 1793, most of the
   slaves in America were directed to the production of cotton.
   Statistical data shows that while less than 10% of the inhabitants of
   the North were slaves, by 1790, Virginia had up to 44% of the total
   slave population. Slavery in the antebellum US was the use of Negro
   labor in bondage.^[94] It was common in agriculture, with a more
   massive presence in the South – region where climate was more
   propitious for agricultural activity.

   Slavery is regarded by economists and historians as a profitable
   system. The transition from indentured servants to slaves is strong
   evidence that the use of slaves offered greater profits to
   farmers.^[95] The relative price of slaves and indentured servants in
   the antebellum period did decrease. Indentured servants became more
   costly with the increase in the demand of skilled labor in
   England.^[96] At the same time, slaves were mostly supplied by United
   States itself and had lower economical costs: lack of language barrier
   and low transportation cost of slaves from one state to the other. In
   the decades preceding the civil war, the United States experienced a
   rapid natural increase of black population.^[97] This fact is evidenced
   by the increase of slave population to nearly fourfold between 1810 and
   1860 even after the slave trade between England and the US was banned
   in 1808.^[94]

   Even though early discussions of scholars such as Eugene Genovese’s
   argue that slavery was a moribund, inefficient system that was only
   kept because of cultural reasons, close to 98 percent of the economists
   nowadays disagree with this possibility and believe that slavery was an
   investment with good returns compared to other assets.^[95] Therefore,
   the use of human beings in bondage would not have ended in 1860 without
   the Civil War.^[citation needed] The most-famous work on the
   profitability of slavery is attributed to Fogel and Engerman. In "Time
   on the Cross," they argue that the rate of return of slavery at the
   market price was close to 10 percent, a number close to investment in
   other assets.

Efficiency of Slaves

   Mixed-race slave girls showing European ancestry, New Orleans

   Scholars do not agree on how to quantify efficiency of slavery. In Time
   on the Cross, Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to Total Factor
   Productivity (TFP) – the output per average unit of input on a farm.
   Using this measurement, farms that employed slaves using the Gang
   System were southern farms were 35% more efficient than Northern farms
   which used free labor. Under the Gang System, groups of slaves perform
   synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each
   group was like a part of a machine. If perceived to be working below
   his capacity, a slave could be punished. However, Fogel argues that
   this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent; that slaves and
   free laborers had similar quality of life. This last statement is a
   controversial one and there is no agreement on this matter.^[98]

Prices of slaves

   Controlling for inflation, prices of slaves rose tremendously in the
   six decades prior to Civil War. There was a decline in the prices of
   slaves relative to indentured servants, but both got more expensive.
   Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield
   high profits. Fogel and Engeman argued that if the Civil War had not
   happened, the slave prices would have increased even more, an average
   of more than 50 percent by 1890.^[98]

   Prices reflected the characteristics of the slave – such factors as
   sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine
   the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, female slaves were more
   expensive than their male counterparts up to puberty age, as they had
   the extra benefit of potentially bearing children and producing more
   slaves. Males around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were
   at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable
   life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, then the value
   decreased significantly as planters believed there was the imminent
   risk of the same action happening again. Taller male slaves were priced
   at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and
   productivity.^[98]

   The conditions of the market led to shocks in the supply and demand of
   slaves, which in turn changed prices. For instance, slaves became more
   expensive after the decrease in supply caused by the ban on importation
   of slaves in 1808. The market for the products of their work also
   affected slaves' economic value: demand for slaves fell with the price
   of cotton in 1840. Anticipation of changes also had a huge influence on
   prices. As the civil war progressed, there was great doubt that slavery
   would continue to be legal, and prime males in New Orleans were sold by
   $1116 in 1862 as opposed to $1381 in 1861.^[99]

Effects of Slavery in Southern Development

   While slavery brought profits in the short run, there is a discussion
   on the economic benefits – or lack of them – of slavery in the
   long-run. Alexis de Tocqueville notes that “the colonies in which there
   were no slaves became more populous and richer than those in which
   slavery flourished^[100] ”. Because agriculture was a good investment
   in the antebellum period,^[98] Gavin Wright admits that the use of
   monetary resources in the cotton industry, among others, lagged the
   development of commercial and industrial institutions. Railroads were
   also less developed in the South as a result. Wright argues that
   agricultural technology was far more developed in the South,
   representing an economic advantage of the South over the North of the
   United States.^[101]

1850s

   Because of the three-fifths compromise in the U.S. Constitution, in
   which slaves counted in the calculation of how many representatives a
   state had in Congress (though only three-fifths as much as a free
   person), the elite planter class had long held power in Congress out of
   proportion to the total number of white Southerners. In 1850 they
   passed a more stringent Federal fugitive slave law. Refugees from
   slavery continued to flee the South across the Ohio River and other
   parts of the Mason-Dixon Line dividing North from South, to the North
   via the Underground Railroad. The physical presence of African
   Americans in Cincinnati, Oberlin, and other Northern towns agitated
   some white Northerners, though others helped hide former slaves from
   their former owners, and others helped them reach freedom in Canada.
   After 1854, Republicans argued that the Slave Power, especially the
   pro-slavery Democratic Party, controlled two of the three branches of
   the Federal government.

   Congress abolished the slave trade (though not the legality of slavery)
   in the District of Columbia as part of the Compromise of 1850.

Bleeding Kansas

   Main article: Bleeding Kansas

   After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, border wars broke
   out in Kansas Territory, where the question of whether it would be
   admitted to the Union as a slave or free state was left to the
   inhabitants. Abolitionist John Brown was active in the rebellion and
   killing in "Bleeding Kansas", as were many white Southerners. At the
   same time, fears that the Slave Power was seizing full control of the
   national government swept anti-slavery Republicans into office.

Dred Scott

   Main article: Dred Scott v. Sandford

   Dred Scott and his wife Harriet Scott each sued for freedom in St.
   Louis after the death of their master on the grounds that they had
   lived in a territory where slavery was forbidden (the northern part of
   the Louisiana Purchase, from which slavery was excluded under the terms
   of the Missouri Compromise). (Later the two cases were combined under
   Dred Scott's name.) Scott filed suit for freedom in 1846 and went
   through two state trials, the first denying and the second granting
   freedom to the couple (and, by extension, their two daughters, who had
   also been held illegally in free territories). Missouri state precedent
   for 28 years had generally provided for freedom in such cases during
   the 19th century, but the State Supreme Court ruled against Scott,
   saying that "times were not what they once were."

   After the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, it denied Scott
   his freedom in a sweeping decision that set the United States on course
   for civil war. The court ruled that, under the Constitution, neither
   Dred Scott nor any descendant of Africans, slave or free, was a citizen
   who had a right to sue in the Federal courts, and that Congress had had
   no constitutional power to pass the Missouri Compromise.

   The 1857 decision, decided 7–2, held that a slave did not become free
   when taken into a free state; Congress could not bar slavery from a
   territory; and people of African descent imported into the United
   States and held as slaves, or their descendants, could not be citizens.
   A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state.
   Many Republicans, including Abraham Lincoln, considered the decision
   unjust and as proof that the Slave Power had seized control of the
   Supreme Court. Written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the decision
   effectively barred slaves and their descendants from citizenship.
   Abolitionists were enraged and slave owners encouraged, contributing to
   tensions on this subject that led to civil war.^[102]

Civil War and emancipation

1860 presidential election

   The divisions became fully exposed with the 1860 presidential election.
   The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed
   slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats
   said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally, state
   by state and territory by territory. The Constitutional Union Party
   said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should
   be compromised.

   Lincoln, the Republican, won with a plurality of popular votes and a
   majority of electoral votes. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the
   ballots of ten southern states: thus his election necessarily split the
   nation along sectional lines. Many slave owners in the South feared
   that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in
   states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of
   four million slaves would be problematic for the slave owners and for
   the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who
   were not paid.

   They also argued that banning slavery in new states would upset what
   they saw as a delicate balance of free states and slave states. They
   feared that ending this balance could lead to the domination of the
   industrial North with its preference for high tariffs on imported
   goods. The combination of these factors led the South to secede from
   the Union, and thus began the American Civil War. Northern leaders had
   viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically, and with
   secession, they viewed the prospect of a new southern nation, the
   Confederate States of America, with control over the Mississippi River
   and the West, as politically and militarily unacceptable.

Civil War

   1870

   The consequent American Civil War, beginning in 1861, led to the end of
   chattel slavery in America. Not long after the war broke out, through a
   legal maneuver credited to Union General Benjamin F. Butler, a lawyer
   by profession, slaves who came into Union "possession" were considered
   "contraband of war". General Butler ruled that they were not subject to
   return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war. Soon word
   spread, and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory, desiring to
   be declared "contraband." Many of the "contrabands" joined the Union
   Army as workers or troops, forming entire regiments of the U.S. Colored
   Troops. Others went to refugee camps such as the Grand Contraband Camp
   near Fort Monroe or fled to northern cities. General Butler's
   interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the Confiscation Act
   of 1861, which declared that any property used by the Confederate
   military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces.

   At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were
   supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it
   became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do
   about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military
   effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to
   protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying
   Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves "…cannot be
   neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the
   rebels, or of the Union."^[103] The same Congressman—and his fellow
   Radical Republicans—put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the
   slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual,
   compensated emancipation and colonization.^[104] Copperheads, the
   border states and War Democrats opposed emancipation, although the
   border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of total
   war needed to save the Union.

Emancipation Proclamation

   Main article: Emancipation Proclamation

   In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at
   emancipation would mean the loss of the border states. He believed that
   "to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."^[105]
   At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War
   Simon Cameron and Generals John C. Fremont (in Missouri) and David
   Hunter (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) in order to keep the
   loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.
   Escaped slaves, ca. 1862

   Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his
   cabinet on July 21, 1862. Secretary of State William H. Seward told
   Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do
   otherwise would seem like "our last shriek on the retreat".^[106] In
   September 1862 the Battle of Antietam provided this opportunity, and
   the subsequent War Governors' Conference added support for the
   proclamation.^[107] Lincoln had already published a letter^[108]
   encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as
   necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was
   "somehow the cause of the war".^[109] Lincoln issued his preliminary
   Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, and said that a final
   proclamation would be issued if his gradual plan based on compensated
   emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. Only the District
   of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln issued his
   final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to
   Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that

     If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong … And yet I have never
     understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted
     right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim
     not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have
     controlled me.^[110]

   Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a powerful
   move that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy as soon as the
   Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African
   Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free
   slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states that bordered the
   Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the
   authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in
   the border states, at first the proclamation freed only slaves who had
   escaped behind Union lines. Still, the proclamation made the abolition
   of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took
   territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this
   policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total
   population of the United States.

   most famous abolitionist novel

   Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war
   powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time.
   However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing
   commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of
   liberty.^[111] Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress
   to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment,^[112] which made emancipation
   universal and permanent.

   Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before
   escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of
   the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union
   lines, especially in Union-controlled areas like Norfolk and the
   Hampton Roads region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line
   of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines
   that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults
   and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary
   Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such
   contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on
   nearby plantations. In addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men
   served with distinction as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most
   of those were escaped slaves. The Confederacy was outraged by black
   soldiers and refused to treat them as prisoners of war. Many were shot,
   as at the Fort Pillow Massacre, and others re-enslaved.^[113]

   The Arizona Organic Act abolished slavery on February 24, 1863 in the
   newly formed Arizona Territory. Tennessee and all of the border states
   (except Kentucky) abolished slavery by early 1865. Thousands of slaves
   were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union
   armies marched across the South. Emancipation as a reality came to the
   remaining southern slaves after the surrender of all Confederate troops
   in spring 1865.

   In spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern
   leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates
   discussed arming slaves, and some free blacks had offered to fight for
   the South. Finally in early 1865 General Robert E. Lee said black
   soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed. The first black
   units were in training when the war ended in April.^[114]

The end of slavery

   Proclamation to his cabinet. Painted by Francis Bicknell Carpenter in
   1864

   The war ended in June 22, 1865 and following that surrender, the
   Emancipation Proclamation was enforced throughout remaining regions of
   the South that had not yet freed the slaves. Slavery continued for a
   couple of months in some locations.^[115] Federal troops arrived in
   Galveston, Texas on June 19, to enforce the emancipation, and that day
   is now celebrated as Juneteenth in several states.

   The thirteenth amendment, abolishing slavery except as punishment for a
   crime, was passed by the Senate in April 1864, and by the House of
   Representatives in January 1865.^[116] The amendment did not take
   effect until it was ratified by three fourths of the states, which
   occurred on December 6, 1865, when Georgia ratified it. On that date,
   all remaining slaves became officially free.^[117]

   Legally, the last 40,000-45,000 slaves were freed in the last two
   slaves states of Kentucky and Delaware^[118] by the final ratification
   of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in December 18, 1865.
   Slaves still held in Tennessee, Kentucky, Kansas, New Jersey, Delaware,
   West Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, Washington, D.C., and twelve
   parishes of Louisiana^[119] also became legally free on this date.
   American historian R.R. Palmer opined that the abolition of slavery in
   the United States without compensation to the former slave owners was
   an "annihilation of individual property rights without parallel...in
   the history of the Western world".^[120] Economic historian Robert E.
   Wright argues that it would have been much cheaper, with minimal
   deaths, if the federal government had purchased and freed all the
   slaves, rather than fighting the Civil War.^[121] Another economic
   historian, Roger Ransom, writes about how Gerald Gunderson compared
   compensated emancipation to the cost of the war and "notes that the two
   are roughly the same order of magnitude — 2.5 to 3.7 billion dollars"
   ^[122]^[123] Ransom also writes that compensated emancipation would
   have tripled federal outlays if paid over the period of 25 years and
   was a program that had no political support within the United States
   during the 1860s.^[123]

   Booker T. Washington, remembered the day in early 1863, when he was a
   boy of nine in Virginia:^[124]

     As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave
     quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later
     into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some
     reference to freedom.... Some man who seemed to be a stranger (a
     United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read
     a rather long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After
     the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when
     and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned
     over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her
     cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day
     for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would
     never live to see.

Reconstruction to present

   In spite of the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation and the
   adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
   the road to freedom remained elusive for most former slaves in the
   United States. While the Constitution of the United States is the
   supreme law of the land, it is not self-enforcing, nor was the
   Emancipation Proclamation. The text and principles outlined in them
   were only words without enforcement, and so alone, they could not and
   did not abolish slavery. The enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment
   simply made slavery and all forms of involuntary servitude, except as
   punishment for crime, unconstitutional. The actual abolition of slavery
   – that is the full enforcement of the 13th Amendment took many decades
   beyond 1865 to be realized. Enforcement of the 13th amendment began
   during the Reconstruction period, but there were many setbacks between
   that time and full enforcement.

   Proponents of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution knew that without
   legislation that codified the 13th Amendment in the form of laws and
   statutes along with law enforcement agencies to uphold the laws, there
   would be no true end to slavery, and this is the reason for the
   inclusion of Section 2 of the 13th Amendment authorizing Congress to
   establish laws upholding the amendment. The federal government also
   sent troops to the south to provide protection to the former slaves who
   were still living among their former captors.

   From 1865 to 1875, federal troops were stationed in the south
   specifically to keep blacks from being re-enslaved. However, after ten
   years of protection the federal troops were withdrawn, leaving blacks
   at the mercy of their former captors. When African Americans in the
   south no longer had the protection of the federal troops, whites found
   other ways to practice involuntary servitude.

   This lasted well into the 20th century, with the last state, Maryland,
   finally abolishing in 1972. Although slavery is commonly understood to
   have ended with the Emancipation Proclamation, or the Thirteenth
   Amendment, exhaustive research conducted by journalist Douglas A.
   Blackmon and reported in his Pulitzer Prize winning book Slavery By
   Another Name shows that thousands of African Americans were re-enslaved
   with shocking force and brutality after the period of Reconstruction
   was over.

   The continued involuntary servitude took various forms but the primary
   forms included convict leasing, peonage, and sharecropping, with the
   latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well. Using convict
   leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at
   all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought
   and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of masters. Sharecropping as it
   was practiced during this period often involved severe restrictions on
   the freedom of movement of sharecroppers who could be whipped for
   leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were
   legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was
   an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by
   authorities while thousands of African Americans were subjugated and
   held in bondage well into the 20th century.

   With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of
   Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce
   the 13th Amendment until December 1941 when President Franklin Delano
   Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after Pearl Harbor,
   at the request of the president Attorney General Francis Biddle issued
   Circular No. 3591 to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to
   actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or
   slavery.

   During Reconstruction, it was a serious question whether slavery had
   been permanently abolished or whether some form of semi-slavery would
   appear after the Union armies left. Over time a large civil rights
   movement arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to
   all Americans.

Convict leasing

   Main article: Convict lease

   With emancipation a legal reality, white Southerners were concerned
   with both controlling the newly freed slaves and keeping them in the
   labor force at the lowest level. The system of convict leasing began
   during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s. This
   system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts
   from the state or local governments for a specific time period. African
   Americans, due to “vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and
   discriminatory sentencing” made up the vast majority of the convicts
   leased.^[125] Writer Douglas A. Blackmon writes of the system:

     It was a form of bondage distinctly different from that of the
     antebellum South in that for most men, and the relatively few women
     drawn in, this slavery did not last a lifetime and did not
     automatically extend from one generation to the next. But it was
     nonetheless slavery – a system in which armies of free men, guilty
     of no crimes and entitled by law to freedom, were compelled to labor
     without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were
     forced to do the bidding of white masters through the regular
     application of extraordinary physical coercion.^[126]

   The constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the Thirteenth
   Amendment, while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude
   generally, expressly permits it as a punishment for crime.

Educational issues

   people during the Civil War
   An industrial school set up for ex-slaves in Richmond during
   Reconstruction

   The anti-literacy laws after 1832 contributed greatly to the problem of
   widespread illiteracy facing the freedmen and other African Americans
   after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later. The problem of
   illiteracy and need for education was seen as one of the greatest
   challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the free
   enterprise system and support themselves during Reconstruction and
   thereafter.

   Consequently, many black and white religious organizations, former
   Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were
   inspired to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the
   betterment of African Americans; some African Americans had started
   their own schools before the end of the war. Northerners helped create
   numerous normal schools, such as those that became Hampton University
   and Tuskegee University, to generate teachers. Blacks held teaching as
   a high calling, with education the first priority for children and
   adults. Many of the most talented went into the field. Some of the
   schools took years to reach a high standard, but they managed to get
   thousands of teachers started. As W. E. B. Du Bois noted, the black
   colleges were not perfect, but "in a single generation they put thirty
   thousand black teachers in the South" and "wiped out the illiteracy of
   the majority of black people in the land."^[127]

   Northern philanthropists continued to support black education in the
   20th century, even as tensions rose within the black community,
   exemplified by Dr. Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, as to
   the proper emphasis between industrial and classical academic education
   at the college level. An example of a major donor to Hampton Institute
   and Tuskegee was George Eastman, who also helped fund health programs
   at colleges and in communities.^[128] Collaborating with Dr. Washington
   in the early decades of the 20th century, philanthropist Julius
   Rosenwald provided matching funds for community efforts to build rural
   schools for black children. He insisted on white and black cooperation
   in the effort, wanting to ensure that white-controlled school boards
   made a commitment to maintain the schools. By the 1930s local parents
   had helped raise funds (sometimes donating labor and land) to create
   over 5,000 rural schools in the South. Other philanthropists, such as
   Henry H. Rogers and Andrew Carnegie, each of whom had arisen from
   modest roots to become wealthy, used matching fund grants to stimulate
   local development of libraries and schools.

Apologies

   On February 24, 2007, the Virginia General Assembly passed House Joint
   Resolution Number 728 acknowledging "with profound regret the
   involuntary servitude of Africans and the exploitation of Native
   Americans, and call for reconciliation among all Virginians."^[129]
   With the passing of this resolution, Virginia became the first state to
   acknowledge through the state's governing body their state's negative
   involvement in slavery. The passing of this resolution came on the
   heels of the 400th anniversary celebration of the city of Jamestown,
   Virginia, which was one of the first slave ports of the American
   colonies.

   On July 30, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a
   resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent
   discriminatory laws.^[130]

   The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a similar resolution on June 18,
   2009, apologizing for the "fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality,
   and inhumanity of slavery".^[131] It also explicitly states that it
   cannot be used for restitution claims.^[132]

Justification

   See also: Proslavery in the antebellum United States

"A necessary evil"

   In the 19th century, proponents of slavery often defended the
   institution as a "necessary evil". White people of that time feared
   that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and
   economic consequences than the continuation of slavery. In 1820, Thomas
   Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, wrote in a
   letter that with slavery:

     We have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely
     let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the
     other.^[133]

   Robert E. Lee wrote in 1856:

     There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not
     acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political
     evil. It is idle to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it is a
     greater evil to the white than to the colored race. While my
     feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my
     sympathies are more deeply engaged for the former. The blacks are
     immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically,
     and socially. The painful discipline they are undergoing is
     necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare
     them, I hope, for better things. How long their servitude may be
     necessary is known and ordered by a merciful Providence.^[134]

   Alexis de Tocqueville, in Democracy in America, also expressed an
   opposition to slavery, but felt that the existence of a multiracial
   society without slavery untenable, and observed prejudice against
   negroes increasing as they were granted more rights (for example, in
   northern states). He considered the attitudes of white southerners, and
   the concentration of the black population in the south–due to
   exportation resulting from restrictions in the north, and climatic and
   economic reasons–that was bringing the white and black population to a
   state of equilibrium, as a danger to both races. Thus, because of the
   racial differences between master and slave, the latter could not be
   emancipated.^[100]

"A positive good"

   However, as the abolition agitation increased and the planting system
   expanded, apologies for slavery became more faint in the South. Then
   apologies were superseded by claims that slavery was a beneficial
   scheme of labor control. John C. Calhoun, in a famous speech in the
   Senate in 1837, declared that slavery was "instead of an evil, a good—a
   positive good." Calhoun supported his view with the following
   reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must
   live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built
   upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and
   mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free
   laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between
   capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this
   respect, he concluded, "will become more and more manifest, if left
   undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in
   wealth and numbers."^[135]

   Others who also moved from the idea of necessary evil to positive good
   are James Henry Hammond and George Fitzhugh. They presented several
   arguments to defend the act of slavery in the South.^[136] Hammond,
   like Calhoun, believed slavery was needed to build the rest of society.
   In a speech to the Senate on March 4, 1858, Hammond developed his
   Mudsill Theory defending his view on slavery stating, “Such a class you
   must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress,
   civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of
   society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to
   build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other,
   except on this mud-sill.” Hammond believed that in every class you must
   have one group to do all the menial duties, because without them the
   leaders in society could not progress.^[137] He argued that the hired
   laborers of the North are slaves too: “The difference… is, that our
   slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation,
   no begging, no want of employment,” while those in the North had to
   search for employment.^[138] George Fitzhugh, like many white people of
   his time, believed in racism and used this belief to justify slavery,
   writing that, “the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed
   as a child.” In "The Universal Law of Slavery" Fitzhugh argues that
   slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is
   unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy, and cannot
   compete with the intelligent European white race. He states that "The
   negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the
   freest people in the world."^[139] Without the South "He (slave) would
   become an insufferable burden to society" and "Society has the right to
   prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic
   slavery."^[140]^[141]

   On March 21, 1861, new southern Confederate, Vice President Alexander
   Stephens, delivered the Cornerstone Speech. The speech explained the
   differences between the constitution of the Confederate Republic and
   that of the United States, and laid out the cause for the American
   Civil War, and a defense of slavery.^[142]

     The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating
     questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as
     it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of
     civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and
     present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated
     this, as the "rock upon which the old Union would split." He was
     right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But
     whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock
     stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained
     by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the
     formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the
     African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in
     principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they
     knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men
     of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence,
     the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas,
     however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption
     of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy
     foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the
     "storm came and the wind blew, it fell."

     Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its
     foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth
     that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery,
     subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral
     condition.^[142]

Native Americans

   Main article: Slavery among Native Americans in the United States

   During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Indian slavery, the
   enslavement of Native Americans by European colonists, was common. Many
   of these Native slaves were exported to the Northern colonies and to
   off-shore colonies, especially the "sugar islands" of the
   Caribbean.^[11] Historian Alan Gallay estimates that from 1670–1715,
   British slave traders sold between 24,000 and 51,000 Native Americans
   from what is now the southern part of the U.S.^[143]

   Slavery of Native Americans was organized in colonial and Mexican
   California through Franciscan missions, theoretically entitled to ten
   years of Native labor, but in practice maintaining them in perpetual
   servitude, until their charge was revoked in the mid-1830s. Following
   the 1847–48 invasion by U.S. troops, the "loitering or orphaned
   Indians" were de facto enslaved in the new state from statehood in 1850
   to 1867.^[144] Slavery required the posting of a bond by the slave
   holder and enslavement occurred through raids and a four-month
   servitude imposed as a punishment for Indian "vagrancy".^[145]

Inter-tribal slavery

   The Haida and Tlingit Indians who lived along southeast Alaska's coast
   were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding
   as far as California. Slavery was hereditary after slaves were taken as
   prisoners of war. Among some Pacific Northwest tribes, about a quarter
   of the population were slaves.^[146]^[147] Other slave-owning tribes of
   North America were, for example, Comanche of Texas, Creek of Georgia,
   the fishing societies, such as the Yurok, that lived along the coast
   from what is now Alaska to California, the Pawnee, and Klamath.^[17]

   After 1800, the Cherokees and the other civilized tribes started buying
   and using black slaves, a practice they continued after being relocated
   to Indian Territory in the 1830s, when as many as 15,000 enslaved
   blacks were taken with them.^[11]^[148]

   The nature of slavery in Cherokee society often mirrored that of white
   slave-owning society. The law barred intermarriage of Cherokees and
   enslaved African Americans.^[11] Cherokee who aided slaves were
   punished with one hundred lashes on the back. In Cherokee society,
   those with African-American descent were barred from holding office
   even if they were a mixed blood Cherokee, bearing arms, and owning
   property, and they made it illegal to teach African Americans to read
   and write.^[11]^[149]^[150]

   By contrast, the Seminoles welcomed into their nation African Americans
   who had escaped slavery (Black Seminoles).

Post-Emancipation Proclamation slavery

   A few captives from other tribes who were used as slaves were not freed
   when African-American slaves were emancipated. Ute Woman, a Ute
   captured by the Arapaho and later sold to a Cheyenne, was one example.
   Used as a prostitute for sale to American soldiers at Cantonment in the
   Indian Territory, she lived in slavery until about 1880 when she died
   of a haemorrhage resulting from "excessive sexual intercourse".^[151]

Black slaveholders

   Some slaveholders were black or had some black ancestry. An African
   former indentured servant arrived to Virginia in 1621, Anthony Johnson,
   became one of the earliest documented slave owners in the mainland
   American colonies when he won a civil suit for ownership of John
   Casor.^[152] In 1830 there were 3,775 such slaveholders in the South
   who owned 12,760 slaves,^[153] with 80% of them located in Louisiana,
   South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. There were economic differences
   between free blacks of the Upper South and Deep South, with the latter
   fewer in number, but wealthier and typically of mixed race. Half of the
   black slaveholders lived in cities rather than the countryside, with
   most in New Orleans and Charleston. Especially New Orleans had a large,
   relatively wealthy free black population (gens de couleur) composed of
   people of mixed race, who had become a third class between whites and
   enslaved blacks under French and Spanish rule. Relatively few
   slaveholders were “substantial planters.” Of those who were, most were
   of mixed race, often endowed by white fathers with some property and
   social capital.^[154] For example, Andrew Durnford of New Orleans was
   listed as owning 77 slaves.^[153] According to Rachel Kranz: “Durnford
   was known as a stern master who worked his slaves hard and punished
   them often in his efforts to make his Louisiana sugar plantation a
   success.”^[155] The historians John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger
   wrote:

     A large majority of profit-oriented free black slaveholders resided
     in the Lower South. For the most part, they were persons of mixed
     racial origin, often women who cohabited or were mistresses of white
     men, or mulatto men.... Provided land and slaves by whites, they
     owned farms and plantations, worked their hands in the rice, cotton,
     and sugar fields, and like their white contemporaries were troubled
     with runaways.^[156]

   The historian Ira Berlin wrote:

     In slave societies, nearly everyone—free and slave—aspired to enter
     the slaveholding class, and upon occasion some former slaves rose
     into slaveholders’ ranks. Their acceptance was grudging, as they
     carried the stigma of bondage in their lineage and, in the case of
     American slavery, color in their skin.^[157]

   African American history and culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.
   wrote: "...the percentage of free black slave owners as the total
   number of free black heads of families was quite high in several
   states, namely 43 percent in South Carolina, 40 percent in Louisiana,
   26 percent in Mississippi, 25 percent in Alabama and 20 percent in
   Georgia."^[158]

   Free blacks were perceived “as a continual symbolic threat to
   slaveholders, challenging the idea that ‘black’ and ‘slave’ were
   synonymous.” Free blacks were seen as potential allies of fugitive
   slaves and “slaveholders bore witness to their fear and loathing of
   free blacks in no uncertain terms.”^[159] For free blacks, who had only
   a precarious hold on freedom, “slave ownership was not simply an
   economic convenience but indispensable evidence of the free blacks'
   determination to break with their slave past and their silent
   acceptance – if not approval – of slavery.”^[160]

   The historian James Oakes in 1982 notes that “[t]he evidence is
   overwhelming that the vast majority of black slaveholders were free men
   who purchased members of their families or who acted out of
   benevolence.”^[161] After 1810 southern states made it increasingly
   difficult for any slaveholders to free slaves. Often the purchasers of
   family members were left with no choice but to maintain, on paper, the
   owner–slave relationship. In the 1850s “there were increasing efforts
   to restrict the right to hold bondsmen on the grounds that slaves
   should be kept ‘as far as possible under the control of white men
   only.’”^[162]

   In his 1985 statewide study of black slaveholders in South Carolina,
   Larry Koger challenged the benevolent view. He found that the majority
   of black slaveholders appeared to hold slaves as a commercial decision.
   For instance, he noted that in 1850 more than 80 percent of black
   slaveholders were of mixed race, but nearly 90 percent of their slaves
   were classified as black.^[163] He also noted the number of small
   artisans in Charleston who held slaves to help with their businesses.

Barbary pirates

   Barbary pirates from North Africa began to seize North American
   colonists as early as 1625,^[164] and roughly 700 Americans were held
   captive in this region as slaves between 1785 and 1815.^[165] Some
   captives used their experiences as a North African slave to criticize
   slavery in the United States, such as William Ray in his book Horrors
   of Slavery.^[166]

   The Barbary situation led directly to the creation of the United States
   Navy in March 1794. While the United States managed to secure peace
   treaties, these obliged it to pay tribute for protection from attack.
   Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of
   United States government annual expenditures in 1800.^[167] The First
   Barbary War in 1801 and the Second Barbary War in 1815 led to more
   favorable peace terms ending the payment of tribute.

Distribution of slaveholders

   As of the 1860 Census, one may compute the following statistics on
   slaveholding:^[169]
     * Enumerating slave schedules by county, 393,975 named persons held
       3,950,546 unnamed slaves, for an average of about ten slaves per
       holder. As some large holders held slaves in multiple counties and
       are thus multiply counted, this slightly overestimates the number
       of slaveholders.
     * Excluding slaves, the 1860 U.S. population was 27,167,529, yielding
       about 1 in 70 free persons (1.5%) being slaveholders. By counting
       only named slaveowners, this approach does not acknowledge people
       who benefited from slavery by being in a slaveowning household,
       e.g. the wife and children of an owner. Only 8% of all US families
       owned slaves,^[170] while in the South, 33% of families owned
       slaves. According to recent research by historian Joseph Glatthaar,
       the number of soldiers of the Confederacy's Army of Northern
       Virginia who either owned slaves or came from slave owning
       households is "almost one of every two 1861 recruits". In addition
       he notes that, "Untold numbers of enlistees rented land from, sold
       crops to, or worked for slaveholders. In the final tabulation, the
       vast majority of the volunteers of 1861 had a direct connection to
       slavery."^[171]
     * The distribution of slaves among holders was very unequal: holders
       of 200 or more slaves, constituting less than 1% of all US
       slaveholders (fewer than 4,000 persons, 1 in 7,000 free persons, or
       0.015% of the population) held an estimated 20–30% of all slaves
       (800,000 to 1,200,000 slaves). Nineteen holders of 500 or more
       slaves have been identified.^[172] The largest slaveholder was
       Joshua John Ward, of Georgetown, South Carolina, who in 1850 held
       1,092 slaves,^[173] and whose heirs in 1860 held 1,130 or 1,131
       slaves^[172]^[173] – he was dubbed "the king of the rice
       planters",^[173] and one of his plantations is now part of
       Brookgreen Gardens.

Historiography

   Main article: Historiography of the United States § Slavery

   The historian Peter Kolchin, writing in 1993, noted that until the
   latter decades of the 20th century, historians of slavery had primarily
   concerned themselves with the culture, practices and economics of the
   slaveholders, not with the slaves. This was in part due to the
   circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind
   written records, whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a
   position to leave written records. Scholars differed as to whether
   slavery should be considered a benign or a “harshly exploitive”
   institution.^[174]

   Much of the history written prior to the 1950s had a distinctive racist
   slant to it.^[174] By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using
   archaeological records, black folklore, and statistical data to develop
   a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals
   were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of
   their activities, within the limits of their situation and despite its
   precariousness. Historians who wrote in this era include John
   Blassingame (Slave Community), Eugene Genovese (Roll, Jordan, Roll),
   Leslie Howard Owens (This Species of Property), and Herbert Gutman (The
   Black Family in Slavery and Freedom).^[175]

       Leone. Cuffee believed that African Americans could more easily
       "rise to be a people" in Africa than in the U.S. because of its
       slavery and limits on black rights. Although Cuffee died in 1817,
       his early efforts encouraged the ACS to lead further settlements.
       The Friends opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better
       chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The slaveholders
       opposed freedom for blacks, but saw repatriation as a way of
       avoiding rebellions.
