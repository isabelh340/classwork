   A probabilistic programming language (PPL) is a programming language
   specially designed to describe and infer with probabilistic models.

   PPLs often extend from a basic language. The inventors' choices of
   underlying basic language depend on the similarity of their models to
   the basic language's ontology, as well as commercial considerations and
   personal preference. For instance, Dimple^[1] and Chimple^[2] are based
   on Java, Infer.NET is based on .NET framework,^[3] while PRISM extends
   from Prolog.^[4] However, some PPLs such as WinBUGS and Stan (software)
   define a self-contained language for their users to use, which is not
   obviously derived from a predecessor language.^[5]^[6]

   Currently there are several PPLs in active development, some of them
   have advanced to the beta stage. However because PRMs are new, up to
   year 2010 there have been no well-known software projects utilizing
   those languages.

Probabilistic relational programming language[edit]

   A probabilistic relational programming language (PRPL) is a PPL
   specially designed to describe and infer with probabilistic relational
   models (PRMs).

   A PRM is usually developed with a set of algorithms for reducing,
   inference about and discovery of concerned distributions, which are
   embedded into the corresponding PRPL.
