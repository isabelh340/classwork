   The Executive Office of the President (EOPOTUS or EOP) consists of the
   immediate staff of the current President of the United States and
   multiple levels of support staff reporting to the President. The EOP is
   headed by the White House Chief of Staff, currently Denis McDonough.
   The size of the White House staff has increased dramatically since
   1939, and has grown to include an array of policy experts in various
   fields.

History[edit]

   In 1939, during Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term in office, the
   foundations of the modern White House staff were created. Based on the
   recommendations of a presidentially commissioned panel of political
   science and public administration experts (led by Dr. Amanda Townsend)
   that were known as the Brownlow Committee, Roosevelt was able to get
   Congress to approve the Reorganization Act of 1939. The Act led to
   Reorganization Plan No. 1,^[1] which created the EOP,^[2] which
   reported directly to the president. The EOP encompassed two subunits at
   its outset: the White House Office (WHO) and the Bureau of the Budget,
   the predecessor to today's Office of Management and Budget, which had
   been created in 1921 and originally located in the Treasury Department.
   It absorbed most of the functions of the National Emergency
   Council.^[3] Initially, the new staff system appeared more ambitious on
   paper than in practice; the increase in the size of the staff was quite
   modest at the start. But it laid the groundwork for the large and
   organizationally complex White House staff that would emerge during the
   presidencies of Roosevelt's successors.^[4]
   The Eisenhower Executive Office Building at night.

   Roosevelt's efforts are also notable in contrast to those of his
   predecessors in office. During the nineteenth century, presidents had
   few staff resources. Thomas Jefferson had one messenger and one
   secretary at his disposal, both of whose salaries were paid by the
   president personally. It was not until 1857 that Congress appropriated
   money ($2,500) for the hiring of one clerk. By Ulysses S. Grant's
   presidency (1869–1877), the staff had grown to three. By 1900, the
   White House staff included one "secretary to the president" (then the
   title of the president's chief aide), two assistant secretaries, two
   executive clerks, a stenographer, and seven other office personnel.
   Under Warren G. Harding, the size of the staff expanded to thirty-one,
   although most were clerical positions. During Herbert Hoover's
   presidency, two additional secretaries to the president were added by
   Congress, one of whom Hoover designated as his Press Secretary. From
   1933 to 1939, even as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal
   government's policies and powers in response to the Great Depression,
   Roosevelt muddled through: his "brains trust" of top advisers, although
   working directly for the President, often were appointed to vacant
   positions in agencies and departments, whence they drew their salaries
   since the White House lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create
   new staff positions.

   From 1939 through the present, the situation changed dramatically. New
   units within the EOP were created, some by statute, some by executive
   order of the president. Among the most important are the Council of
   Economic Advisers (1946), the National Security Council and its staff
   (1947), the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (1963), the Council
   on Environmental Quality (1970), the Office of Science and Technology
   Policy (1976), the Office of Administration (1977), and the Office of
   National Drug Control Policy (1989). Under George W. Bush, additional
   units were added, such as the Office of Homeland Security (2001), which
   later became a Cabinet department, and the Office of Faith-based and
   Community Initiatives (2001). Precise estimates as to the size and
   budget of the EOP are difficult to come by. Many people who work on the
   staff are "detailed" from other federal departments and agencies, and
   budgetary expenses are often charged elsewhere, for example Defense
   Department staff for the White House Military Office. Ballpark
   estimates indicate some 2,000 to 2,500 persons serve in EOP staff
   positions with policy-making responsibilities, with a budget of $300 to
   $400 million (George W. Bush's budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 was
   for $341 million in support of 1,850 personnel).^[5]

Organization[edit]

   Senior staff within the Executive Office of the President have the
   title Assistant to the President, second-level staff have the title
   Deputy Assistant to the President, and third-level staff have the title
   Special Assistant to the President.

   Very few EOP (Executive Office of the President) officials are required
   to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, although there are a handful of
   exceptions to this rule (e.g., the Director of the Office of Management
   and Budget, the Chair and members of the Council of Economic Advisers,
   and the United States Trade Representative). The core White House Staff
   appointments do not require Senate approval. The staff of the Executive
   Office of the President is managed by the White House Chief of Staff.
