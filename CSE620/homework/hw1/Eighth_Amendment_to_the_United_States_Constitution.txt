   The Eighth Amendment (Amendment VIII) to the United States Constitution
   is the part of the United States Bill of Rights (ratified December 15,
   1791^[1]) prohibiting the federal government from imposing excessive
   bail, excessive fines or cruel and unusual punishments, including
   torture. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that this amendment's Cruel
   and Unusual Punishment Clause also applies to the states. The phrases
   in this amendment originated in the English Bill of Rights of 1689.

     Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,
     nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.^[2]

Background

   The Eighth Amendment was adopted, as part of the Bill of Rights, in
   1791. It is almost identical to a provision in the English Bill of
   Rights of 1689, in which Parliament declared, "as their ancestors in
   like cases have usually done...that excessive bail ought not to be
   required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
   punishments inflicted."^[3]

   The provision was largely inspired by the case in England of Titus
   Oates who, after the ascension of King James II in 1685, was tried for
   multiple acts of perjury which had caused many executions of people
   whom Oates had wrongly accused. Oates was sentenced to imprisonment
   including an annual ordeal of being taken out for two days pillory plus
   one day of whipping while tied to a moving cart. The Oates case
   eventually became a topic of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Eighth Amendment
   jurisprudence.^[4] The punishment of Oates involved ordinary penalties
   collectively imposed in a barbaric, excessive and bizarre manner.^[5]
   The reason why the judges in Oates' perjury case were not allowed to
   impose the death penalty (unlike in the cases of those whom Oates had
   falsely accused) may be because such a punishment would have deterred
   even honest witnesses from testifying in later cases.^[6]

   England’s declaration against "cruel and unusual punishments" was
   approved by Parliament in February 1689, and was read to King William
   III and his wife Queen Mary II on the following day.^[7] Members of
   Parliament then explained in August 1689 that “the Commons had a
   particular regard…when that Declaration was first made” to punishments
   like the one that had been inflicted by the King's Bench against Titus
   Oates.^[7] Parliament then enacted the English Bill of Rights into law
   in December 1689.^[7] Members of parliament characterized the
   punishment in the Oates case as not just "barbarous" and "inhuman" but
   also "extravagant" and “exorbitant".^[8]

   In England, the "cruel and unusual punishments" clause was a limitation
   on the discretion of judges, and required judges to adhere to
   precedent. According to the great treatise of the 1760s by William
   Blackstone entitled Commentaries on the Laws of England:

     [H]owever unlimited the power of the court may seem, it is far from
     being wholly arbitrary; but its discretion is regulated by law. For
     the bill of rights has particularly declared, that excessive fines
     ought not to be imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments
     inflicted: (which had a retrospect to some unprecedented proceedings
     in the court of king's bench, in the reign of king James the
     second)....^[9]

   Virginia adopted this provision of the English Bill of Rights in the
   Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and the Virginia convention
   that ratified the U.S. Constitution recommended in 1788 that this
   language also be included in the Constitution.^[10]

   Virginians such as George Mason and Patrick Henry wanted to ensure that
   this restriction would also be applied as a limitation on Congress.
   Mason warned that, otherwise, Congress may “inflict unusual and severe
   punishments.”^[11] Henry emphasized that Congress should not be allowed
   to depart from precedent:

     What has distinguished our ancestors?--That they would not admit of
     tortures, or cruel and barbarous punishment. But Congress may
     introduce the practice of the civil law, in preference to that of
     the common law. They may introduce the practice of France, Spain,
     and Germany....^[12]

   Ultimately, Henry and Mason prevailed, and the Eighth Amendment was
   adopted. James Madison changed "ought" to "shall", when he proposed the
   amendment to Congress in 1789.^[10]

Excessive bail

   Main article: Excessive Bail Clause

   In England, sheriffs originally determined whether to grant bail to
   criminal suspects. Since they tended to abuse their power, Parliament
   passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses
   were defined. The King's judges often subverted the provisions of the
   law. It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the
   Sovereign's command. Eventually, the Petition of Right of 1628 argued
   that the King did not have such authority. Later, technicalities in the
   law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even
   where the offenses were bailable; such loopholes were for the most part
   closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. Thereafter, judges were compelled
   to set bail, but they often required impracticable amounts. Finally,
   the English Bill of Rights (1689) held that "excessive bail ought not
   to be required." Nevertheless, the Bill did not determine the
   distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses. Thus, the
   Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied
   if the charges are sufficiently serious. The Supreme Court has also
   permitted "preventive" detention without bail. In United States v.
   Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), the Supreme Court held that the only
   limitation imposed by the bail clause is that "the government's
   proposed conditions of release or detention not be 'excessive' in light
   of the perceived evil." In Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951), the
   Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is "excessive" under the
   Eighth Amendment if it were "a figure higher than is reasonably
   calculated" to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial.^[13]

Excessive fines

   In Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 212 U.S. 86 (1909), the Supreme
   Court held that excessive fines are those which are "so grossly
   excessive as to amount to a deprivation of property without due process
   of law." The Court wrote in its syllabus:

     The fixing of punishment for crime and penalties for unlawful acts
     is within the police power of the state, and this Court cannot
     interfere with state legislation in fixing fines, or judicial action
     in imposing them, unless so grossly excessive as to amount to
     deprivation of property without due process of law. Where a state
     antitrust law fixed penalties at $5,000 a day, and, after verdict of
     guilty for over 300 days, a defendant corporation was fined over
     $1,600,000, this Court will not hold that the fine is so excessive
     as to amount to deprivation of property without due process of law
     where it appears that the business was extensive and profitable
     during the period of violation, and that the corporation has over
     $40,000,000 of assets and has declared dividends amounting to
     several hundred percent

   The Court further stated in its opinion:

     [I]t is contended that the fines imposed are so excessive as to
     constitute a taking of the defendant's property without due process
     of law. It is not contended in this connection that the prohibition
     of the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution against
     excessive fines operates to control the legislation of the states.
     The fixing of punishment for crime or penalties for unlawful acts
     against its laws is within the police power of the state. We can
     only interfere with such legislation and judicial action of the
     states enforcing it if the fines imposed are so grossly excessive as
     to amount to a deprivation of property without due process of law.

   In Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas the Supreme Court set up a standard
   for judging whether or not a fine is "excessive." The standard set up
   is that a fine must not be "so grossly excessive as to amount to
   deprivation of property without due process of law." In other words,
   the government must not be able to confiscate such a large amount of
   property without following an established set of rules created by the
   legislature.^[14]

   In United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998), the Supreme Court
   ruled that it was unconstitutional to take $357,144 from a person who
   failed to report his taking of more than $10,000 in US currency out of
   the United States.^[15] In what was the first case in which the Supreme
   Court ruled a fine to violate the Excessive Fines Clause,^[16] the
   Court held that it was "grossly disproportional" to take all of the
   money which Mr. Bajakajian attempted to take out of the United States,
   in violation of a federal law that required him to report an amount in
   excess of $10,000. In describing what constituted "gross
   disproportionality," the Court could not find any guidance from the
   history of the Excessive Fines Clause and so relied on Cruel and
   Unusual Punishment Clause case law:

     We must therefore rely on other considerations in deriving a
     constitutional excessiveness standard, and there are two that we
     find particularly relevant. The first, which we have emphasized in
     our cases interpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, is
     that judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense
     belong in the first instance to the legislature. See, e.g., Solem v.
     Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983) (“Reviewing courts … should grant
     substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures
     necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of
     punishments for crimes”); see also Gore v. United States, 357 U.S.
     386, 393 (1958) (“Whatever views may be entertained regarding
     severity of punishment, … these are peculiarly questions of
     legislative policy”). The second is that any judicial determination
     regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offense will be
     inherently imprecise. Both of these principles counsel against
     requiring strict proportionality between the amount of a punitive
     forfeiture and the gravity of a criminal offense, and we therefore
     adopt the standard of gross disproportionality articulated in our
     Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause precedents. See, e.g., Solem v.
     Helm, supra, at 288; Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 271 (1980).

   Thus the Court declared that, within the context of judicial deference
   to the legislature's power to set punishments, a fine would not offend
   the Eighth Amendment unless it were "grossly disproportional to the
   gravity of a defendant's offense." ^[13]

Cruel and unusual punishments

   Main article: Cruel and unusual punishment

   According to the Supreme Court, the Eighth Amendment forbids some
   punishments entirely, and forbids some other punishments that are
   excessive when compared to the crime, or compared to the competence of
   the perpetrator.

   In Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947), the
   Supreme Court assumed arguendo that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
   Clause applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the
   Fourteenth Amendment. In Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962),
   the Court ruled that it did apply to the states through the Fourteenth
   Amendment. Robinson was the first case in which the Supreme Court
   applied the Eighth Amendment against the state governments through the
   Fourteenth Amendment. Before Robinson, the Eighth Amendment had only
   been applied against the federal government.^[17]

   Justice Potter Stewart's opinion for the Robinson Court held that
   "infliction of cruel and unusual punishment [is] in violation of the
   Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments." The framers of the Fourteenth
   Amendment, such as John Bingham, had discussed this subject:

     [M]any instances of State injustice and oppression have already
     occurred in the State legislation of this Union, of flagrant
     violations of the guarantied privileges of citizens of the United
     States, for which the national Government furnished and could
     furnish by law no remedy whatever. Contrary to the express letter of
     your Constitution, "cruel and unusual punishments" have been
     inflicted under State laws within this Union upon citizens, not only
     for crimes committed, but for sacred duty done, for which and
     against which the Government of the United States had provided no
     remedy and could provide none.^[18]

   In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), Justice Brennan wrote,
   "There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a
   particular punishment is 'cruel and unusual'."
     * The "essential predicate" is "that a punishment must not by its
       severity be degrading to human dignity," especially torture.
     * "A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly
       arbitrary fashion."
     * "A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected
       throughout society."
     * "A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary."

   Justice Brennan also wrote that he expected no state would pass a law
   obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions
   regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a "cumulative" analysis of
   the implication of each of the four principles. In this way, the United
   States Supreme Court "set the standard that a punishment would be cruel
   and unusual [,if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was
   arbitrary, if it offended society's sense of justice, or if it was not
   more effective than a less severe penalty."^[19]

Punishments forbidden regardless of the crime

   In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130 (1878), the Supreme Court commented
   that drawing and quartering, public dissection, burning alive, or
   disembowelment constituted cruel and unusual punishment.^[20] In
   Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988), the Supreme Court ruled that
   the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment if the
   defendant is under age 16 when the crime was committed. In Atkins v.
   Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), the Court declared that executing people
   who are mentally handicapped constituted cruel and unusual punishment.
   Likewise, in Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), the Court barred
   the executing of people who were under age 18 when the crime was
   committed.

Punishments forbidden for certain crimes

   The case of Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910), marked the
   first time that the Supreme Court exercised judicial review to overturn
   a criminal sentence as cruel and unusual.^[21] The Court overturned a
   punishment called cadena temporal, which mandated "hard and painful
   labor," shackling for the duration of incarceration, and permanent
   civil disabilities. This case is often viewed as establishing a
   principle of proportionality under the Eighth Amendment.^[22] However,
   others have written that "it is hard to view Weems as announcing a
   constitutional requirement of proportionality."^[23]

   In Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), the Supreme Court held that
   punishing a natural-born citizen for a crime by taking away his
   citizenship is unconstitutional, being "more primitive than torture"
   because it involved the "total destruction of the individual's status
   in organized society."

   In Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), the Court decided that
   a California law authorizing a 90-day jail sentence for "be[ing]
   addicted to the use of narcotics" violated the Eighth Amendment, as
   narcotics addiction "is apparently an illness," and California was
   attempting to punish people based on the state of this illness, rather
   than for any specific act. The Court wrote:

     "To be sure, imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a
     punishment which is either cruel or unusual. But the question cannot
     be considered in the abstract. Even one day in prison would be a
     cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common
     cold."

   However, in Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), the Court upheld a
   statute barring public intoxication by distinguishing Robinson on the
   basis that Powell dealt with a person who was drunk in public, not
   merely for being addicted to alcohol.^[24]

   Traditionally, the length of a prison sentence was not subject to
   scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment, regardless of the crime for which
   the sentence was imposed. It was not until the case of Solem v. Helm,
   463 U.S. 277 (1983), that the Supreme Court held that incarceration,
   standing alone, could constitute cruel and unusual punishment if it
   were "disproportionate" in duration to the offense. The Court outlined
   three factors that were to be considered in determining if the sentence
   is excessive: "(i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the
   penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same
   jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the
   same crime in other jurisdictions." The Court held that in the
   circumstances of the case before it and the factors to be considered, a
   sentence of life imprisonment without parole for cashing a $100 check
   on a closed account was cruel and unusual.

   However, in Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), a fractured
   Court retreated from the Solem test and held that for non-capital
   sentences, the Eighth Amendment only constrains the length of prison
   terms by a "gross disproportionality principle." Under this principle,
   the Court sustained a mandatory sentence of life without parole imposed
   for possession of 672 grams (1.5 pounds) or more of cocaine. The Court
   acknowledged that a punishment could be cruel but not unusual, and
   therefore not prohibited by the Constitution.^[25]^[26] Additionally,
   in Harmelin, Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, said
   "the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality guarantee," and that
   "what was 'cruel and unusual' under the Eighth Amendment was to be
   determined without reference to the particular offense." Scalia wrote
   "If 'cruel and unusual punishments' included disproportionate
   punishments, the separate prohibition of disproportionate fines (which
   are certainly punishments) would have been entirely superfluous."
   Moreover, "There is little doubt that those who framed, proposed, and
   ratified the Bill of Rights were aware of such provisions [outlawing
   disproportional punishments], yet chose not to replicate them."

   In Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. ___ (2010), the Supreme Court declared
   that a life sentence without any chance of parole, for a crime other
   than murder, is cruel and unusual punishment for a minor.^[27]^[28] Two
   years later, in Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. ___ (2012), the Court went
   further, holding that mandatory life sentences without parole cannot be
   imposed on minors, even for homicide.^[29]

Death penalty for rape

   In Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977), the Court declared that the
   death penalty was unconstitutionally excessive for rape of a woman and,
   by implication, for any crime where a death does not occur. The
   majority in Coker stated that "death is indeed a disproportionate
   penalty for the crime of raping an adult woman." The dissent countered
   that the majority "takes too little account of the profound suffering
   the crime imposes upon the victims and their loved ones." The dissent
   also characterized the majority as "myopic" for only considering legal
   history of "the past five years".

   In Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008), the Court extended the
   reasoning of Coker by ruling that the death penalty was excessive for
   child rape "where the victim’s life was not taken."^[30] The Supreme
   Court failed to note a federal law, which applies to military
   court-martial proceedings, providing for the death penalty in cases of
   child rape.^[31] On October 1, 2008, the Court declined to reconsider
   its opinion in this case, but did amend the majority and dissenting
   opinions in order to acknowledge that federal law. Justice Scalia
   (joined by Chief Justice Roberts) wrote in dissent that "the proposed
   Eighth Amendment would have been laughed to scorn if it had read 'no
   criminal penalty shall be imposed which the Supreme Court deems
   unacceptable.'"^[32]

Special procedures for death penalty cases

   The first significant general challenge to capital punishment that
   reached the Supreme Court was the case of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S.
   238 (1972). In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court overturned the death
   sentences of Furman for murder, as well as two other defendants for
   rape. Of the five justices voting to overturn the death penalty, two
   found capital punishment to be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual,
   while three found that the statutes at issue were implemented in a
   random and capricious fashion, discriminating against blacks and the
   poor. Furman v. Georgia did not hold – even though it is sometimes
   claimed that it did – that capital punishment is per se
   unconstitutional.^[33]

   States with capital punishment rewrote their laws to address the
   Supreme Court's decision, and the Court then revisited the issue in a
   murder case: Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976). In Gregg, the Court
   found, in a 7–2 ruling, that Georgia's new death penalty laws passed
   Eighth Amendment scrutiny: the statutes provided a bifurcated trial in
   which guilt and sentence were determined separately; and, the statutes
   provided for "specific jury findings" followed by state supreme court
   review comparing each death sentence "with the sentences imposed on
   similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a
   particular case is not disproportionate." Because of the Gregg
   decision, executions resumed in 1977.

   Some states have passed laws imposing mandatory death penalties in
   certain cases. The Supreme Court found these laws to be
   unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, in the murder case of
   Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976), because these laws
   remove discretion from the trial judge to make an individualized
   determination in each case.^[34] Other statutes specifying factors for
   courts to use in making their decisions have been upheld. Some have
   not: in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980), the Supreme Court
   overturned a sentence based upon a finding that a murder was
   "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman," as it deemed
   that any murder may be reasonably characterized in this manner.
   Similarly, in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356 (1988), the Court
   found that an "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel" standard in a
   homicide case was too vague. However, the meaning of this language
   depends on how lower courts interpret it. In Walton v. Arizona, 497
   U.S. 639 (1990), the Court found that the phrase "especially heinous,
   cruel, or depraved" was not vague in a murder case, because the state
   supreme court had expounded on its meaning.^[35]

   The Court has generally held that death penalty cases require extra
   procedural protections. As the Court said in Herrera v. Collins, 506
   U.S. 390 (1993), which involved the murder of a police officer, "the
   Eighth Amendment requires increased reliability of the process..."

Punishments specifically allowed

   In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130 (1878), the Court stated that death
   by firing squad was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth
   Amendment.

   In Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263 (1980), the Court upheld a life
   sentence with the possibility of parole imposed per Texas's three
   strikes law for fraud crimes totaling $230. A few months after pleading
   guilty Rummel was released.^[36]

   In Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), the Court upheld a life
   sentence without the possibility of parole for possession of 672 grams
   (1.5 pounds) of cocaine.

   In Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63 (2003), the Court upheld a 50 years
   to life sentence with the possibility of parole imposed under
   California's three strikes law when the defendant was convicted of
   shoplifting videotapes worth a total of about $150.

Evolving standards of decency

   In Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), Chief Justice Earl Warren said:
   "The [Eighth] Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving
   standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."
   Subsequently, the Court has looked to societal developments, as well as
   looking to its own independent judgment, in determining what are those
   "evolving standards of decency".^[37]

   Originalists like Justice Antonin Scalia argue that societies may rot
   instead of maturing, and may decrease in virtue or wisdom instead of
   increasing. Thus, they say, the framers wanted the amendment to be
   understood as it was written and ratified, instead of morphing as times
   change, and in any event legislators are more competent than judges to
   take the pulse of the public as to changing standards of decency.^[38]

   The "evolving standards" test is not without its scholarly critics as
   well. For example, Professor John Stinneford asserts that the "evolving
   standards" test misinterprets the Eighth Amendment:

     The Framers of the Bill of Rights understood the word “unusual” to
     mean “contrary to long usage.” Recognition of the word’s original
     meaning will precisely invert the “evolving standards of decency”
     test, and ask the Court to compare challenged punishments with the
     longstanding principles and precedents of the common law, rather
     than shifting and nebulous notions of “societal consensus” and
     contemporary “standards of decency.”^[39]

   On the other hand, Dennis Baker defends the evolving standards of
   decency test as a way to advance the moral purpose of the Eighth
   Amendment and the Framer’s intent to ban all forms of unjust
   punishment.^[40]

Proportionality

   The Court has applied evolving standards not only to say what
   punishments are inherently cruel, but also to say what punishments that
   are not inherently cruel are nevertheless "grossly disproportionate" to
   the offense in question.^[37] An example can be seen in Jackson v.
   Bishop (8th Cir., 1968), an Eighth Circuit decision outlawing corporal
   punishment in the Arkansas prison system: "The scope of the Amendment
   is not static....[D]isproportion, both among punishments and between
   punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered...."^[41]

   Professor Stinneford asserts that the Eighth Amendment forbids
   punishments that are very disproportionate to the offense, even if the
   punishment by itself is not intrinsically barbaric, but Stinneford
   argues that "proportionality is to be measured primarily in terms of
   prior practice" according to the word "unusual" in the amendment,
   instead of being measured according to shifting and nebulous evolving
   standards.^[8] Similarly, Professor John Bessler points to "An Essay on
   Crimes and Punishments," written by Cesare Beccaria in the 1760s, which
   advocated proportionate punishments; many of the Founding Fathers,
   including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, read Beccaria's treatise
   and were influenced by it.^[42]

   Thus, Stinneford and Bessler disagree with the view of Justice Scalia,
   joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, in Harmelin v. Michigan where they
   denied that the Punishments Clause contains any proportionality
   principle.^[43] With Scalia and Rehnquist, Richard Epstein argues that
   the amendment does not refer broadly to the imposition of penalties,
   but rather refers more narrowly to the penalties themselves; Epstein
   says that judges who favor the broad view tend to omit the letter "s"
   at the end of the word "punishments".^[44]

       Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause,” 97 Virginia Law Review 899,
       926–61 (2011). Stinneford writes (emphasis added):

     [E]ven if one stacked up all of Oates’s punishments together—the
     fine, the whippings, the imprisonment, the pillorying, and the
     defrockment—their cumulative effect was less harsh as an absolute
     matter than some punishments considered acceptable at the time, such
     as drawing and quartering or burning at the stake. If the
     punishments inflicted on Oates were unacceptably cruel, this could
     only be because they were disproportionate to the crime of perjury.
       But, says Stinneford, punishment is unacceptable only if it is
       "both cruel and 'contrary to long usage'". Id. at 977 (emphasis
       added).

       such provisions [outlawing disproportional punishments], yet chose
       not to replicate them."
