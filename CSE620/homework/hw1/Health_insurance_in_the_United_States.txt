   In the United States, health insurance is any program that helps pay
   for medical expenses, whether through privately purchased insurance,
   social insurance or a social welfare program funded by the
   government.^[1] Synonyms for this usage include "health coverage,"
   "health care coverage" and "health benefits."

   In a more technical sense, the term is used to describe any form of
   insurance that provides protection against the costs of medical
   services. This usage includes private insurance and social insurance
   programs such as Medicare, which pools resources and spreads the
   financial risk associated with major medical expenses across the entire
   population to protect everyone, as well as social welfare programs such
   as Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which
   provide assistance to people who cannot afford health coverage.

   In addition to medical expense insurance, "health insurance" may also
   refer to insurance covering disability or long-term nursing or
   custodial care needs. Different health insurance provides different
   levels of financial protection and the scope of coverage can vary
   widely, with more than 40 percent of insured individuals reporting that
   their plans do not adequately meet their needs as of 2007.^[2]

   The share of Americans with health insurance has been steadily
   declining since at least 2000. As of 2010 just under 84% of Americans
   had some form of health insurance, which meant that more than 49
   million people went without coverage for at least part of the year.
   Declining rates of coverage and underinsurance are largely attributable
   to rising insurance costs and high unemployment. As the pool of people
   with private health insurance has shrunk, Americans are increasingly
   reliant on public insurance. Public programs now cover 31% of the
   population and are responsible for 44% of health care spending. Public
   insurance programs tend to cover more vulnerable people with greater
   health care needs. Many of the reforms instituted by the Affordable
   Care Act of 2010 were designed to extend health care coverage to those
   without it.^[3]

Enrollment and the Uninsured[edit]

   Uninsured patients share their experience with the health care system
   in the United States.

   According to the United States Census Bureau, roughly 55% obtain
   insurance through an employer, while about 10% purchase it directly.
   About 31% of Americans were enrolled in a public health insurance
   program: 14.5% (45 million – although that number has since risen to 48
   million) had Medicare, 15.9% (49 million) had Medicaid, and 4.2% (13
   million) had military health insurance (there is some overlap, causing
   percentages to add up to more than 100%).^[3] Employers may also
   provide reimbursement for health insurance purchased individually by
   their employees through a Defined contribution health benefits plan.
   Employers are allowed to pay employees cash in lieu of health
   insurance, but this is uncommon as it is subject to strict IRS
   regulations.^[4]

Trends in private coverage[edit]

   The percentage of non-elderly workers with employer-sponsored coverage
   has been falling, from 68% in 2000 to 61% in 2009, the latest year for
   which data is available.^[5] While the primary cause of falling rates
   of insurance is the rising cost of health care for employers,^[6] the
   economic downturn since 2008 has swelled the ranks of the uninsured, in
   large part because workers who lose their jobs also lose
   employer-sponsored insurance.^[7] Over 1 million workers lost their
   health care coverage in January, February and March 2009.
   Approximately, 268,400 more workers lost health care coverage in March
   2009 than in March 2008,^[8] so the decline of employer sponsored
   insurance has likely accelerated in recent years.

   Industry experts expect that in the coming decade there will be a shift
   to defined contribution health benefits plans, similar to the recent
   shift in retirement plans from defined benefit to defined
   contribution.^[9]^[10]

Trends in public coverage[edit]

   As a smaller and smaller share of the public is covered by private
   insurance, public insurance has grown more essential. In 2000, 10.5% of
   the public was covered by Medicaid, while 13.5% had Medicare. By 2010,
   those figures had risen to 14.5% and 15.9% respectively.^[3]

   A report published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2008 found
   that economic downturns dramatically increase the public's reliance on
   state Medicaid and SCHIP and can cause significant financial strain for
   the programs. The authors estimated that a 1% increase in the
   unemployment rate would increase Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by 1
   million, and increase the number uninsured by 1.1 million. State
   spending on Medicaid and SCHIP would increase by $1.4 billion (total
   spending on these programs would increase by $3.4 billion). This
   increased spending would occur at the same time state government
   revenues were declining. During the last downturn, the Jobs and Growth
   Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) included federal
   assistance to states, which helped states avoid tightening their
   Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility rules. The authors conclude that
   Congress should consider similar relief for the current economic
   downturn.^[11] Funding for Medicaid and SCHIP was in fact expanded
   significantly under the 2010 health reform bill.^[12]

Status of the uninsured[edit]

   2008.

   (darker means higher percentage).
   Main article: Uninsured in the United States

   Based on self-reported census data, in 2010, more than 49 million
   people in the US (more than 16% of the population) were without health
   insurance as defined in the questions asked. The percentage of the
   non-elderly population who are uninsured has been generally increasing
   since the year 2000.^[6] Among the uninsured population, some 40
   million were employment-age adults (ages 18 to 64), and more than 28
   million worked at least part-time. About 37% of the uninsured live in
   households with incomes over $50,000.^[3]

   According to the Census Bureau, more than 40 million of the uninsured
   are US citizens. Another 9.7 million are non-citizens, but the Census
   Bureau does not distinguish in its estimate between documented and
   undocumented migrants.^[3] It has been estimated that nearly one fifth
   of the uninsured population is able to afford insurance, almost one
   quarter is eligible for public coverage, and the remaining 56% need
   financial assistance (8.9% of all Americans).^[13] An estimated 5
   million of those without health insurance are considered "uninsurable"
   because of pre-existing conditions.^[14]

   A 2011 study found that there were 2.1 million hospital stays for
   uninsured patients, accounting for 4.4 percent ($17.1 billion) of total
   aggregate inpatient hospital costs in the United States.^[15] The costs
   of treating the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as
   charity care, passed on to the insured via cost-shifting and higher
   health insurance premiums, or paid by taxpayers through higher
   taxes.^[16]

Death[edit]

   Since people who lack health insurance are unable to obtain timely
   medical care, they have a 40 percent higher risk of death in any given
   year than those with health insurance, according to a study published
   in the American Journal of Public Health. The study estimated that in
   2005 in the United States, there were 45,000 deaths associated with
   lack of health insurance.^[17]

   A Johns Hopkins Hospital study found that heart transplant
   complications occurred most often amongst the uninsured, and that
   patients who had private health plans fared better than those covered
   by Medicaid or Medicare.^[18] Gallup issued a report in July 2014
   stating that the uninsured rate for adults 18 and over declined from
   18% in 2013 to 13.4% by in 2014, largely due to new coverage options
   and market reforms under the Affordable Care Act.^[19] Rand Corporation
   had similar findings.^[20]

Reform[edit]

   The Affordable Care Act of 2010 was designed primarily to extend health
   coverage to those without it by expanding Medicaid, creating financial
   incentives for employers to offer coverage, and requiring those without
   employer or public coverage to purchase insurance in newly created
   state-run health insurance exchanges. The CBO has estimated that
   roughly 33 million who would have otherwise been uninsured will receive
   coverage because of the act by 2022.^[21]

History[edit]

   See also: History of insurance

   Accident insurance was first offered in the United States by the
   Franklin Health Assurance Company of Massachusetts. This firm, founded
   in 1850, offered insurance against injuries arising from railroad and
   steamboat accidents. Sixty organizations were offering accident
   insurance in the US by 1866, but the industry consolidated rapidly soon
   thereafter. While there were earlier experiments, the origins of
   sickness coverage in the US effectively date from 1890. The first
   employer-sponsored group disability policy was issued in 1911, but this
   plan's primary purpose was replacing wages lost due to an inability to
   work, not medical expenses.^[22]

   Before the development of medical expense insurance, patients were
   expected to pay all other health care costs out of their own pockets,
   under what is known as the fee-for-service business model. During the
   middle to late 20th century, traditional disability insurance evolved
   into modern health insurance programs. Today, most comprehensive
   private health insurance programs cover the cost of routine,
   preventive, and emergency health care procedures, and also most
   prescription drugs, but this was not always the case. The rise of
   private insurance was accompanied by the gradual expansion of public
   insurance programs for those who could not acquire coverage through the
   market.

   Hospital and medical expense policies were introduced during the first
   half of the 20th century. During the 1920s, individual hospitals began
   offering services to individuals on a pre-paid basis, eventually
   leading to the development of Blue Cross organizations in the
   1930s.^[22] The first employer-sponsored hospitalization plan was
   created by teachers in Dallas, Texas in 1929.^[23] Because the plan
   only covered members' expenses at a single hospital, it is also the
   forerunner of today's health maintenance organizations
   (HMOs).^[23]^[24]^[25]

   In the 1930s, The Roosevelt Administration explored possibilities for
   creating a national health insurance program, while it was designing
   the Social Security system. But it abandoned the project because the
   American Medical Association (AMA) fiercely opposed it, along with all
   forms of health insurance at that time.^[26]

The rise of employer-sponsored coverage[edit]

   Employer-sponsored health insurance plans dramatically expanded as a
   direct result of wage controls imposed by the federal government during
   World War II.^[23] The labor market was tight because of the increased
   demand for goods and decreased supply of workers during the war.
   Federally imposed wage and price controls prohibited manufacturers and
   other employers from raising wages enough to attract workers. When the
   War Labor Board declared that fringe benefits, such as sick leave and
   health insurance, did not count as wages for the purpose of wage
   controls, employers responded with significantly increased offers of
   fringe benefits, especially health care coverage, to attract
   workers.^[23]

   President Harry S. Truman proposed a system of public health insurance
   in his November 19, 1945, address. He envisioned a national system that
   would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants
   would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any
   and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government
   would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to
   join the program. In addition, the insurance plan would give a cash
   balance to the policy holder to replace wages lost due to illness or
   injury. The proposal was quite popular with the public, but it was
   fiercely opposed by the Chamber of Commerce, the American Hospital
   Association, and the AMA, which denounced it as “socialism.”^[27]

   Foreseeing a long and costly political battle, many labor unions chose
   to campaign for employer-sponsored coverage, which they saw as a less
   desirable but more achievable goal, and as coverage expanded the
   national insurance system lost political momentum and ultimately failed
   to pass. Using health care and other fringe benefits to attract the
   best employees, private sector, white-collar employers nation-wide
   expanded the U.S. health care system. Public sector employers followed
   suit in an effort to compete. Between 1940 and 1960, the total number
   of people enrolled in health insurance plans grew seven-fold, from
   20,662,000 to 142,334,000,^[28] and by 1958, 75% of Americans had some
   form of health coverage.^[29]

Medicare and Medicaid[edit]

   Still, private insurance remained unaffordable or simply unavailable to
   many, including the poor, the unemployed, and the elderly. Before 1965,
   only half of seniors had health care coverage, and they paid three
   times as much as younger adults, despite having lower incomes.^[30]
   Consequently, interest persisted in creating public health insurance
   for those left out of the private marketplace.

   The 1960 Kerr-Mills Act provided matching funds to states assisting
   patients with their medical bills. In the early 1960s, Congress
   rejected a plan to subsidize private coverage for people with Social
   Security as unworkable, and an amendment to the Social Security Act
   creating a publicly run alternative was proposed. Finally, President
   Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare and Medicaid programs into law in
   1965, creating publicly run insurance for the elderly and the
   poor.^[31] Medicare was later expanded to cover people with
   disabilities, end-stage renal disease, and ALS.

Towards universal coverage[edit]

   Persistent lack of insurance among many working Americans continued to
   create pressure for a comprehensive national health insurance system.
   In the early 1970s, there was fierce debate between two alternative
   models for universal coverage. Senator Ted Kennedy proposed a universal
   single-payer system, while President Nixon countered with his own
   proposal based on mandates and incentives for employers to provide
   coverage while expanding publicly run coverage for low-wage workers and
   the unemployed. Compromise was never reached, and Nixon’s resignation
   and a series of economic problems later in the decade diverted
   Congress’s attention away from health reform.

   Shortly after his inauguration, President Clinton offered a new
   proposal for a universal health insurance system. Like Nixon’s plan,
   Clinton’s relied on mandates, both for individuals and for insurers,
   along with subsidies for people who could not afford insurance. The
   bill would have also created “health-purchasing alliances” to pool risk
   among multiple businesses and large groups of individuals. The plan was
   staunchly opposed by the insurance industry and employers’ groups and
   received only mild support from liberal groups, particularly unions,
   which preferred a single payer system. Ultimately it failed after the
   Republican takeover of Congress in 1994.^[32]

   Finally achieving universal health coverage remained a top priority
   among Democrats, and passing a health reform bill was one of the Obama
   Administration’s top priorities. The Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act was similar to the Nixon and Clinton plans, mandating
   coverage, penalizing employers who failed to provide it, and creating
   mechanisms for people to pool risk and buy insurance collectively.^[12]
   Earlier versions of the bill included a publicly run insurer that could
   compete to cover those without employer sponsored coverage (the
   so-called public option), but this was ultimately stripped to secure
   the support of moderates. The bill passed the Senate in December 2009
   with all Democrats voting in favor and the House in March 2010 with the
   support of most Democrats. Not a single Republican voted in favor of it
   either time.

Public health care coverage[edit]

   Public programs provide the primary source of coverage for most seniors
   and also low-income children and families who meet certain eligibility
   requirements. The primary public programs are Medicare, a federal
   social insurance program for seniors (generally persons aged 65 and
   over) and certain disabled individuals; Medicaid, funded jointly by the
   federal government and states but administered at the state level,
   which covers certain very low income children and their families; and
   SCHIP, also a federal-state partnership that serves certain children
   and families who do not qualify for Medicaid but who cannot afford
   private coverage. Other public programs include military health
   benefits provided through TRICARE and the Veterans Health
   Administration and benefits provided through the Indian Health Service.
   Some states have additional programs for low-income individuals.^[33]
   In 2011, approximately 60 percent of stays were billed to Medicare and
   Medicaid—up from 52 percent in 1997.^[34]

Medicare[edit]

   Main article: Medicare (United States)

   In the United States, Medicare is a federal social insurance program
   that provides health insurance to people over the age of 65,
   individuals who become totally and permanently disabled, end stage
   renal disease (ESRD) patients, and people with ALS. Recent research has
   found that the health trends of previously uninsured adults, especially
   those with chronic health problems, improves once they enter the
   Medicare program.^[35] Traditional Medicare requires considerable
   cost-sharing, but ninety percent of Medicare enrollees have some kind
   of supplemental insurance - either employer-sponsored or retiree
   coverage, Medicaid, or a private Medigap plan – that covers some or all
   of their cost-sharing.^[36] With supplemental insurance, Medicare
   ensures that its enrollees have predictable, affordable health care
   costs regardless of unforeseen illness or injury.

   As the population covered by Medicare grows, its costs are projected to
   rise from slightly over 3 percent of GDP to over 6 percent,
   contributing substantially to the federal budget deficit.^[37] In 2011,
   Medicare was the primary payer for an estimated 15.3 million inpatient
   stays, representing 47.2 percent ($182.7 billion) of total aggregate
   inpatient hospital costs in the United States.^[15] The Affordable Care
   Act took some steps to reduce Medicare spending, and various other
   proposals are circulating to reduce it further.

Medicare Advantage[edit]

   Main article: Medicare Advantage

   Medicare Advantage plans expand the health insurance options for people
   with Medicare. Medicare Advantage was created under the Balanced Budget
   Act of 1997, with the intent to better control the rapid growth in
   Medicare spending, as well as to provide Medicare beneficiaries more
   choices. But on average, Medicare Advantage plans cost 12% more than
   traditional Medicare.^[38] The ACA took steps to align payments to
   Medicare Advantage plans with the cost of traditional Medicare.

   There is some evidence that Medicare Advantage plans select patients
   with low risk of incurring major medical expenses to maximize profits
   at the expense of traditional Medicare.^[39]

Medicare Part D[edit]

   Main article: Medicare Part D

   Medicare Part D provides a private insurance option to allow Medicare
   beneficiaries to purchase subsidized coverage for the costs of
   prescription drugs. It was enacted as part of the Medicare Prescription
   Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and went into
   effect on January 1, 2006.^[40]

Medicaid[edit]

   Main article: Medicaid

   Medicaid was instituted for the very poor in 1965. Since enrollees must
   pass a means test, Medicaid is a social welfare or social protection
   program rather than a social insurance program. Despite its
   establishment, the percentage of US residents who lack any form of
   health insurance has increased since 1994.^[41] It has been reported
   that the number of physicians accepting Medicaid has decreased in
   recent years due to lower reimbursement rates.^[42]

   The Affordable Care Act dramatically expanded Medicaid. The program
   will now cover everyone with incomes under 133% of the federal poverty
   level who does not qualify for Medicare, provided this expansion of
   coverage has been accepted by the state where the person resides.
   Meanwhile, Medicaid benefits must be the same as the essential benefit
   in the newly created state exchanges. The federal government will fully
   fund the expansion of Medicaid initially, with some of the financial
   responsibility gradually devolving back to the states by 2020.

   In 2011, there were 7.6 million hospital stays billed to Medicaid,
   representing 15.6% (approximately $60.2 billion) of total aggregate
   inpatient hospital costs in the United States.^[15]

State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)[edit]

   Main article: State Children's Health Insurance Program

   The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a joint
   state/federal program to provide health insurance to children in
   families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, yet cannot
   afford to buy private insurance. The statutory authority for SCHIP is
   under title XXI of the Social Security Act. SCHIP programs are run by
   the individual states according to requirements set by the federal
   Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and may be structured as
   independent programs separate from Medicaid (separate child health
   programs), as expansions of their Medicaid programs (SCHIP Medicaid
   expansion programs), or combine these approaches (SCHIP combination
   programs). States receive enhanced federal funds for their SCHIP
   programs at a rate above the regular Medicaid match.

Military health benefits[edit]

   Main article: Military Health System

   Health benefits are provided to active duty service members, retired
   service members and their dependents by the Department of Defense
   Military Health System (MHS). The MHS consists of a direct care network
   of Military Treatment Facilities and a purchased care network known as
   TRICARE. Additionally, veterans may also be eligible for benefits
   through the Veterans Health Administration.

Indian health service[edit]

   The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical assistance to eligible
   American Indians at IHS facilities, and helps pay the cost of some
   services provided by non-IHS health care providers.^[33]

State risk pools[edit]

   In 1976, some states began providing guaranteed-issuance risk pools,
   which enable individuals who are medically uninsurable through private
   health insurance to purchase a state-sponsored health insurance plan,
   usually at higher cost. Minnesota was the first to offer such a plan;
   34 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
   Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
   Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
   Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota,
   Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
   Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming) now offer them. Plans
   vary greatly from state to state, both in their costs and benefits to
   consumers and in their methods of funding and operations. They serve a
   very small portion of the uninsurable market—about 182,000 people in
   the U.S. as of 2004,^[43] and about 200,000 in 2008.^[44]

   These risk pools allow people with pre-existing conditions such as
   cancer, diabetes, heart disease or other chronic illnesses to be able
   to switch jobs or seek self-employment without fear of being without
   health care benefits.^[45] However, the plans are expensive, with
   premiums that can be double the average policy, and the pools currently
   cover only 1 in 25 of the so-called "uninsurable" population.^[14]
   Additionally, even plans which are not expensive can leave those
   enrolled with little real health insurance beyond "catastrophic"
   insurance; for example, one insurance plan through Minnesota's
   high-risk pool, while costing only $215 per quarter, includes a $10,000
   deductible with no preventative or other health care covered unless and
   until the enrollee has spent $10,000 of their own money during the year
   on health care.^[46] Very sick people can accumulate large medical
   bills during mandatory waiting periods before their medical expenses
   are covered, and there are often lifetime expenditure caps (maximums),
   after which the risk pool no longer pays for any medical expenses.^[47]

   Efforts to pass a national pool have been unsuccessful, but some
   federal tax money has been awarded to states to innovate and improve
   their plans. With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
   effective by 2014, it will be easier for people with pre-existing
   conditions to afford regular insurance, since all insurers will be
   fully prohibited from discriminating against or charging higher rates
   for any individuals based on pre-existing medical conditions.^[48]^[49]

Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan[edit]

   Main article: Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan

   The Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, or PCIP, is a transitional
   program created in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
   (PPACA). Those eligible for PCIP are citizens of the United States or
   those legally residing in the U.S., who have been uninsured for the
   last 6 months and "have a pre-existing condition or have been denied
   health coverage because of their health condition." However, if one has
   health insurance or is enrolled in a state high risk pool, they are not
   eligible for PCIP, even if that coverage does not cover their medical
   condition. PCIP is run by the individual states or through the U.S.
   Department of Health and Human Services, which has a contract with the
   Government Employees Health Association, or GEHA, to administer
   benefits. Both will be funded by the federal government and provide
   three plan options. These options are the standard, extended, and the
   Health Savings Account option. PCIP only covers the individual enrollee
   and does not include family members or dependents. In 2014, the
   Affordable Care Act provision banning discrimination based on
   pre-existing conditions will be implemented and PCIP enrollees will be
   transitioned into new state-based health care exchanges.^[50]^[51]^[52]

Private health care coverage[edit]

   Private health insurance may be purchased on a group basis (e.g., by a
   firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. Most
   Americans with private health insurance receive it through an
   employer-sponsored program. According to the United States Census
   Bureau, some 60% of Americans are covered through an employer, while
   about 9% purchase health insurance directly.^[53] Private insurance was
   billed for 12.2 million inpatient hospital stays in 2011, incurring
   approximately 29% ($112.5 billion) of the total aggregate inpatient
   hospital costs in the United States.^[15]

   The US has a joint federal/state system for regulating insurance, with
   the federal government ceding primary responsibility to the states
   under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. States regulate the content of health
   insurance policies and often require coverage of specific types of
   medical services or health care providers.^[54]^[55] State mandates
   generally do not apply to the health plans offered by large employers,
   due to the preemption clause of the Employee Retirement Income Security
   Act.

Employer-sponsored[edit]

   Employer-sponsored health insurance is paid for by businesses on behalf
   of their employees as part of an employee benefit package. Most private
   (non-government) health coverage in the US is employment-based. Nearly
   all large employers in America offer group health insurance to their
   employees.^[56] The typical large-employer PPO plan is typically more
   generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits
   Program Standard Option.^[57]

   The employer typically makes a substantial contribution towards the
   cost of coverage.^[58] Typically, employers pay about 85% of the
   insurance premium for their employees, and about 75% of the premium for
   their employees' dependents. The employee pays the remaining fraction
   of the premium, usually with pre-tax/tax-exempt earnings. These
   percentages have been stable since 1999.^[59] Health benefits provided
   by employers are also tax-favored: Employee contributions can be made
   on a pre-tax basis if the employer offers the benefits through a
   section 125 cafeteria plan.

   Although workers are effectively paid less than they would be, because
   of the cost of insurance premiums to the employer, employer-sponsored
   health insurance offers several benefits to workers, including
   economies of scale, a reduction in adverse selection pressures on the
   insurance pool (premiums are lower when all employees participate
   rather than just the sickest), and reduced income taxes.^[23] The
   disadvantages include disruptions related to changing jobs, the
   regressive tax effect (high-income workers benefit far more from the
   tax exemption for premiums than low-income workers), and increased
   spending on healthcare.^[23]

   Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since
   2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have
   risen 19% and inflation has risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the
   Kaiser Family Foundation.^[60] Employer costs have risen noticeably per
   hour worked, and vary significantly. In particular, average employer
   costs for health benefits vary by firm size and occupation. The cost
   per hour of health benefits is generally higher for workers in
   higher-wage occupations, but represent a smaller percentage of
   payroll.^[61] The percentage of total compensation devoted to health
   benefits has been rising since the 1960s.^[62] Average premiums,
   including both the employer and employee portions, were $4,704 for
   single coverage and $12,680 for family coverage in 2008.^[59]^[63]

   However, in a 2007 analysis, the Employee Benefit Research Institute
   concluded that the availability of employment-based health benefits for
   active workers in the US is stable. The "take-up rate," or percentage
   of eligible workers participating in employer-sponsored plans, has
   fallen somewhat, but not sharply. EBRI interviewed employers for the
   study, and found that others might follow if a major employer
   discontinued health benefits. Effective by January 1, 2014, the Patient
   Protection and Affordable Care Act will impose a $2000 per employee tax
   penalty on employers with over 50 employees who do not offer health
   insurance to their full-time workers. (In 2008, over 95% of employers
   with at least 50 employees offered health insurance.^[64])^[65] On the
   other hand, public policy changes could also result in a reduction in
   employer support for employment-based health benefits.^[66]

   Although much more likely to offer retiree health benefits than small
   firms, the percentage of large firms offering these benefits fell from
   66% in 1988 to 34% in 2002.^[56]

Small employer group coverage[edit]

   According to a 2007 study, about 59% of employers at small firms (3-199
   workers) in the US provide employee health insurance. The percentage of
   small firms offering coverage has been dropping steadily since 1999.
   The study notes that cost remains the main reason cited by small firms
   who do not offer health benefits.^[67] Small firms that are new are
   less likely to offer coverage than ones that have been in existence for
   a number of years. For example, using 2005 data for firms with fewer
   than 10 employees, 43% of those that had been in existence at least 20
   years offered coverage, but only 24% of those that had been in
   existence less than 5 years did. The volatility of offer rates from
   year to year also appears to be higher for newer small businesses.^[68]

   The types of coverage available to small employers are similar to those
   offered by large firms, but small businesses do not have the same
   options for financing their benefit plans. In particular, self-funded
   health care (whereby an employer provides health or disability benefits
   to employees with its own funds rather than contracting an insurance
   company^[69]) is not a practical option for most small employers.^[70]
   A RAND Corporation study published in April 2008 found that the cost of
   health care coverage places a greater burden on small firms, as a
   percentage of payroll, than on larger firms.^[71] A study published by
   the American Enterprise Institute in August 2008 examined the effect of
   state benefit mandates on self-employed individuals, and found that
   "the larger the number of mandates in a state, the lower the
   probability that a self-employed person will be a significant
   employment generator."^[72] Beneficiary cost sharing is, on average,
   higher among small firms than large firms.^[73]

   When small group plans are medically underwritten, employees are asked
   to provide health information about themselves and their covered family
   members when they apply for coverage. When determining rates, insurance
   companies use the medical information on these applications. Sometimes
   they will request additional information from an applicant's physician
   or ask the applicants for clarification. [4]

   States regulate small group premium rates, typically by placing limits
   on the premium variation allowable between groups (rate bands).
   Insurers price to recover their costs over their entire book of small
   group business while abiding by state rating rules.^[74] Over time, the
   effect of initial underwriting "wears off" as the cost of a group
   regresses towards the mean. Recent claim experience - whether better or
   worse than average - is a strong predictor of future costs in the near
   term. But the average health status of a particular small employer
   group tends to regress over time towards that of an average group.^[75]
   The process used to price small group coverage changes when a state
   enacts small group reform laws.^[76]

   Insurance brokers play a significant role in helping small employers
   find health insurance, particularly in more competitive markets.
   Average small group commissions range from 2 percent to 8 percent of
   premiums. Brokers provide services beyond insurance sales, such as
   assisting with employee enrollment and helping to resolve benefits
   issues.^[77]

College-sponsored health insurance for students[edit]

   Many colleges, universities, graduate schools, professional schools and
   trade schools offer a school-sponsored health insurance plan. Many
   schools require that you enroll in the school-sponsored plan unless you
   are able to show that you have comparable coverage from another source.

   Effective group health plan years beginning after September 23, 2010,
   if an employer-sponsored health plan allows employees' children to
   enroll in coverage, then the health plan must allow employees' adult
   children to enroll as well as long as the adult child is not yet age
   26. Some group health insurance plans may also require that the adult
   child not be eligible for other group health insurance coverage, but
   only before 2014.^[78]

   This extension of coverage will help cover one in three young adults,
   according to White House documents.

Federal employees health benefit plan (FEHBP)[edit]

   In addition to such public plans as Medicare and Medicaid, the federal
   government also sponsors a health benefit plan for federal
   employees—the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). FEHBP
   provides health benefits to full-time civilian employees. Active-duty
   service members, retired service members and their dependents are
   covered through the Department of Defense Military Health System (MHS).
   FEHBP is managed by the federal Office of Personnel Management.

"Portability" of group coverage[edit]

   Two federal laws address the ability of individuals with
   employment-based health insurance coverage to maintain coverage.

   The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA)
   enables certain individuals with employer-sponsored coverage to extend
   their coverage if certain "qualifying events" would otherwise cause
   them to lose it. Employers may require COBRA-qualified individuals to
   pay the full cost of coverage, and coverage cannot be extended
   indefinitely. COBRA only applies to firms with 20 or more employees,
   although some states also have "mini-COBRA" laws that apply to small
   employers.

   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
   provides for forms of both "group-to-group" and "group-to-individual"
   portability. When an individual moves from one employer's benefit plan
   to another's, the new plan must count coverage under the old plan
   against any waiting period for pre-existing conditions, as long as
   there is not a break in coverage of more than 63 days between the two
   plans. When certain qualified individuals lose group coverage
   altogether, they must be guaranteed access to some form of individual
   coverage. To qualify, they must have at least 18 months of prior
   continuous coverage. The details of access and the price of coverage
   are determined on a state-by-state basis.

Association group health insurance[edit]

   Regular health insurance is sometimes available to members of
   associations. Associations such as the American Bar Association offer
   health insurance to their members,^[not in citation given] using an
   established insurance company to write the policies for a group
   plan.^[79]

Individually purchased[edit]

   Main article: Individually purchased health insurance in the United
   States

   According to the US Census Bureau, about 9% of Americans are covered
   under health insurance purchased directly.^[53] The range of products
   available is similar to those provided through employers. However,
   average out-of-pocket spending is higher in the individual market, with
   higher deductibles, co-payments and other cost-sharing
   provisions.^[73]^[80] Major medical is the most commonly purchased form
   of individual health insurance. Although a major medical health
   insurance policy is primarily a catastrophic plan, qualified preventive
   benefits are still covered at 100% without any waiting period or
   copay.^[81]

   In the individual market, the consumer pays the entire premium without
   benefit of an employer contribution.^[80]^[82] While self-employed
   individuals receive a tax deduction for their health insurance and can
   buy health insurance with additional tax benefits, most consumers in
   the individual market do not receive any tax benefit.^[83]

   Premiums vary significantly by age.^[80]^[84]^[85] In states that allow
   individual medical plan underwriting, premiums also vary by health
   status.^[80] However, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
   Act, effective by 2014, all insurers will be fully prohibited from
   discriminating against or charging higher rates for any individuals
   based on pre-existing medical conditions.^[48]^[49]

   In August 2008, the Hartford Courant reported that competition was
   increasing in the individual health insurance market, with more
   insurers entering the market, an increased variety of products, and a
   broader spread of prices.^[86]

   Individual health insurance is primarily regulated at the state level,
   consistent with the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Model acts and regulations
   promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
   (NAIC) provide some degree of uniformity state to state. These models
   do not have the force of law and have no effect unless they are adopted
   by a state. They are, however, used as guides by most states, and some
   states adopt them with little or no change.

Types of medical insurance[edit]

Traditional indemnity or fee-for-service[edit]

   Early hospital and medical plans offered by insurance companies paid
   either a fixed amount for specific diseases or medical procedures
   (schedule benefits) or a percentage of the provider's fee. The
   relationship between the patient and the medical provider was not
   changed. The patient received medical care and was responsible for
   paying the provider. If the service was covered by the policy, the
   insurance company was responsible for reimbursing or indemnifying the
   patient based on the provisions of the insurance contract
   ("reimbursement benefits"). Health insurance plans that are not based
   on a network of contracted providers, or that base payments on a
   percentage of provider charges, are still described as indemnity or
   fee-for-service plans.^[22]

Blue Cross Blue Shield Association[edit]

   Main article: Blue Cross Blue Shield Association

   The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) is a federation of
   38 separate health insurance organizations and companies in the United
   States. Combined, they directly or indirectly provide health insurance
   to over 100 million Americans.^[87] BCBSA insurance companies are
   franchisees, independent of the association (and traditionally each
   other), offering insurance plans within defined regions under one or
   both of the association's brands. Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers offer
   some form of health insurance coverage in every U.S. state. They also
   act as administrators of Medicare in many states or regions of the
   U.S., and provide coverage to state government employees as well as to
   the federal government employees under a nationwide option of the
   Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan.^[88]

Health Maintenance Organizations[edit]

   Main article: Health Maintenance Organization

   A health maintenance organization (HMO) is a type of managed care
   organization (MCO) that provides a form of health care coverage that is
   fulfilled through hospitals, doctors, and other providers with which
   the HMO has a contract. The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973
   required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally
   certified HMO options.^[89] Unlike traditional indemnity insurance, an
   HMO covers only care rendered by those doctors and other professionals
   who have agreed to treat patients in accordance with the HMO's
   guidelines and restrictions in exchange for a steady stream of
   customers. Benefits are provided through a network of providers.
   Providers may be employees of the HMO ("staff model"), employees of a
   provider group that has contracted with the HMO ("group model"), or
   members of an independent practice association ("IPA model"). HMOs may
   also use a combination of these approaches ("network model").^[22]^[90]

Managed care[edit]

   Main article: Managed care

   The term managed care is used to describe a variety of techniques
   intended to reduce the cost of health benefits and improve the quality
   of care. It is also used to describe organizations that use these
   techniques ("managed care organization").^[91] Many of these techniques
   were pioneered by HMOs, but they are now used in a wide variety of
   private health insurance programs. Through the 1990s, managed care grew
   from about 25% US employees with employer-sponsored coverage to the
   vast majority.^[92]

   ^[93]

Network-based managed care[edit]

   Many managed care programs are based on a panel or network of
   contracted health care providers. Such programs typically include:
     * A set of selected providers that furnish a comprehensive array of
       health care services to enrollees;
     * Explicit standards for selecting providers;
     * Formal utilization review and quality improvement programs;
     * An emphasis on preventive care; and
     * Financial incentives to encourage enrollees to use care
       efficiently.

   Provider networks can be used to reduce costs by negotiating favorable
   fees from providers, selecting cost effective providers, and creating
   financial incentives for providers to practice more efficiently.^[25] A
   survey issued in 2009 by America's Health Insurance Plans found that
   patients going to out-of-network providers are sometimes charged
   extremely high fees.^[94]^[95]

   Network-based plans may be either closed or open. With a closed
   network, enrollees' expenses are generally only covered when they go to
   network providers. Only limited services are covered outside the
   network—typically only emergency and out-of-area care. Most traditional
   HMOs were closed network plans. Open network plans provide some
   coverage when an enrollee uses non-network provider, generally at a
   lower benefit level to encourage the use of network providers. Most
   preferred provider organization plans are open-network (those that are
   not are often described as exclusive provider organizations, or EPOs),
   as are point of service (POS) plans.

   The terms "open panel" and "closed panel" are sometimes used to
   describe which health care providers in a community have the
   opportunity to participate in a plan. In a "closed panel" HMO, the
   network providers are either HMO employees (staff model) or members of
   large group practices with which the HMO has a contract. In an "open
   panel" plan the HMO or PPO contracts with independent practitioners,
   opening participation in the network to any provider in the community
   that meets the plan's credential requirements and is willing to accept
   the terms of the plan's contract.

Other managed care techniques[edit]

   Other managed care techniques include such elements as disease
   management, case management, wellness incentives, patient education,
   utilization management and utilization review. These techniques can be
   applied to both network-based benefit programs and benefit programs
   that are not based on a provider network. The use of managed care
   techniques without a provider network is sometimes described as
   "managed indemnity."

Blurring lines[edit]

   Over time, the operations of many Blue Cross and Blue Shield operations
   have become more similar to those of commercial health insurance
   companies.^[96] However, some Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans continue
   to serve as insurers of last resort.^[97] Similarly, the benefits
   offered by Blues plans, commercial insurers, and HMOs are converging in
   many respects due to market pressures. One example is the convergence
   of preferred provider organization (PPO) plans offered by Blues and
   commercial insurers and the point of service plans offered by HMOs.
   Historically, commercial insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans,
   and HMOs might be subject to different regulatory oversight in a state
   (e.g., the Department of Insurance for insurance companies, versus the
   Department of Health for HMOs). Today, it is common for commercial
   insurance companies to have HMOs as subsidiaries, and for HMOs to have
   insurers as subsidiaries (the state license for an HMO is typically
   different from that for an insurance company).^[22]^[90]^[98] At one
   time the distinctions between traditional indemnity insurance, HMOs and
   PPOs were very clear; today, it can be difficult to distinguish between
   the products offered by the various types of organization operating in
   the market.^[99]

   The blurring of distinctions between the different types of health care
   coverage can be seen in the history of the industry's trade
   associations. The two primary HMO trade associations were the Group
   Health Association of America and the American Managed Care and Review
   Association. After merging, they were known as American Association of
   Health Plans (AAHP). The primary trade association for commercial
   health insurers was the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA).
   These two have now merged, and are known as America’s Health Insurance
   Plans (AHIP).

New types of medical plans[edit]

   In recent years, various new types of medical plans have been
   introduced.

   High-deductible health plan (HDHP)

   Plans with much higher deductibles than traditional health plans –
   primarily providing coverage for catastrophic illness – have been
   introduced.^[100] Because of the high deductible, these provide little
   coverage for everyday expenses – and thus have potentially high
   out-of-pocket expenses – but do cover major expenses. Couple with these
   are various forms of savings plans.

   Tax-preferenced health care spending account

   Coupled with high-deductible plans are various tax-advantaged savings
   plans – funds (such as salary) can be placed in a savings plan, and
   then go to pay the out-of-pocket expenses. This approach to addressing
   increasing premiums is dubbed "consumer driven health care", and
   received a boost in 2003, when President George W. Bush signed into law
   the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. The
   law created tax-deductible Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), untaxed
   private bank accounts for medical expenses, which can be established by
   those who already have health insurance. Withdrawals from HSAs are only
   penalized if the money is spent on non-medical items or services. Funds
   can be used to pay for qualified expenses, including doctor's fees,
   Medicare Parts A and B, and drugs, without being taxed.^[101]

   Consumers wishing to deposit pre-tax funds in an HSA must be enrolled
   in a high-deductible insurance plan (HDHP) with a number of
   restrictions on benefit design; in 2007, qualifying plans must have a
   minimum deductible of US$1,050. Currently, the minimum deductible has
   risen to $1.200 for individuals and $2,400 for families. HSAs enable
   healthier individuals to pay less for insurance and deposit money for
   their own future health care, dental and vision expenses.^[102]

   HSAs are one form of tax-preferenced health care spending accounts.
   Others include Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), Archer Medical
   Savings Accounts (MSAs), which have been superseded by the new HSAs
   (although existing MSAs are grandfathered), and Health Reimbursement
   Accounts (HRAs). These accounts are most commonly used as part of an
   employee health benefit package.^[103] While there are currently no
   government-imposed limits to FSAs, legislation currently being
   reconciled between the House of Representatives and Senate would impose
   a cap of $2,500. While both the House and Senate bills would adjust the
   cap to inflation, approximately 7 million Americans who use their FSAs
   to cover out-of-pocket health care expenses greater than $2,500 would
   be forced to pay higher taxes and health care costs.

   In July 2009, Save Flexible Spending Plans, a national grassroots
   advocacy organization, was formed to protect against the restricted use
   of FSAs in health care reform efforts, Save Flexible Spending Accounts
   is sponsored by the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation (ECFC),
   a non-profit organization “dedicated to the maintenance and expansion
   of the private employee benefits on a tax-advantaged basis”.^[104] ECFC
   members include companies such as WageWorks Inc., a benefits provider
   based in San Mateo, California.

   Most FSA participants are middle income Americans, earning
   approximately $55,000 annually.^[105] Individuals and families with
   chronic illnesses typically receive the most benefit from FSAs; even
   when insured, they incur annual out-of-pocket expenses averaging $4,398
   .^[106] Approximately 44 percent of Americans have one or more chronic
   conditions .^[107]

   Limited benefit plan

   Opposite to high-deductible plans are plans which provide limited
   benefits – up to a low level – have also been introduced. These limited
   medical benefit plans pay for routine care and do not pay for
   catastrophic care, they do not provide equivalent financial security to
   a major medical plan. Annual benefit limits can be as low as
   $2,000.^[citation needed] Lifetime maximums can be very low as
   well.^[citation needed]

   Discount medical card

   One option that is becoming more popular is the discount medical card.
   These cards are not insurance policies, but provide access to discounts
   from participating health care providers. While some offer a degree of
   value, there are serious potential drawbacks for the consumer.^[108]

   Short term

   Short term health insurance plans have a short policy period (typically
   months) and are intended for people who only need insurance for a short
   time period before longer term insurance is obtained.^[109] Short term
   plans typically cost less than traditional plans and have shorter
   application processes, but do not cover pre-existing conditions.

   Health care sharing

   A Health care sharing ministry is an organization that facilitates
   sharing of health care costs between individual members who have common
   ethical or religious beliefs. Though a health care sharing ministry is
   not an insurance company, members are exempted from the individual
   responsibility requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act.^[110]

Health care markets and pricing[edit]

   The US health insurance market is highly concentrated, as leading
   insurers have carried out over 400 mergers from the mid-1990s to the
   mid-2000s (decade). In 2000, the two largest health insurers (Aetna and
   UnitedHealth Group) had total membership of 32 million. By 2006 the top
   two insurers, WellPoint and UnitedHealth, had total membership of 67
   million. The two companies together had more than 36% of the national
   market for commercial health insurance. The AMA has said that it "has
   long been concerned about the impact of consolidated markets on patient
   care." A 2007 AMA study found that in 299 of the 313 markets surveyed,
   one health plan accounted for at least 30% of the combined health
   maintenance organization (HMO)/preferred provider organization (PPO)
   market. In 90% of markets, the largest insurer controls at least 30% of
   the market, and the largest insurer controls more than 50% of the
   market in 54% of metropolitan areas.^[111] The US Department of Justice
   has recognized this percentage of market control as conferring
   substantial monopsony power in the relations between insurer and
   physicians.^[112]

   Most provider markets (especially hospitals) are also highly
   concentrated, - roughly 80%, according to criteria established by the
   FTC and Department of Justice^[113] - so insurers usually have little
   choice about which providers to include in their networks, and
   consequently little leverage to control the prices they pay. Large
   insurers frequently negotiate most-favored nation clauses with
   providers, agreeing to raise rates significantly while guaranteeing
   that providers will charge other insurers higher rates.^[114]

   According to some experts, such as Uwe Reinhardt,^[115] Sherry Glied,
   Megan Laugensen,^[116] Michael Porter, and Elizabeth Teisberg,^[117]
   this pricing system is highly inefficient and is a major cause of
   rising health care costs. Health care costs in the United States vary
   enormously between plans and geographical regions, even when input
   costs are fairly similar, and rise very quickly. Health care costs have
   risen faster than economic growth at least since the 1970s. Public
   health insurance programs typically have more bargaining power as a
   result of their greater size and typically pay less for medical
   services than private plans, leading to slower cost growth, but the
   overall trend in health care prices have led public programs’ costs to
   grow at an rapid pace as well.

Other types of health insurance (non-medical)[edit]

   While the term "health insurance" is most commonly used by the public
   to describe coverage for medical expenses, the insurance industry uses
   the term more broadly to include other related forms of coverage, such
   as disability income and long-term care insurance.

Disability income insurance[edit]

   Main article: Disability insurance

   Disability income (DI) insurance pays benefits to individuals who lose
   their ability to work due to injury or illness. DI insurance replaces
   income lost while the policyholder is unable to work during a period of
   disability (in contrast to medical expense insurance, which pays for
   the cost of medical care).^[118] For most working age adults, the risk
   of disability is greater than the risk of premature death, and the
   resulting reduction in lifetime earnings can be significant. Private
   disability insurance is sold on both a group and an individual basis.
   Policies may be designed to cover long-term disabilities (LTD coverage)
   or short-term disabilities (STD coverage).^[119] Business owners can
   also purchase disability overhead insurance to cover the overhead
   expenses of their business while they are unable to work.^[120]

   A basic level of disability income protection is provided through the
   Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program for qualified
   workers who are totally and permanently disabled (the worker is
   incapable of engaging in any "substantial gainful work" and the
   disability is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death).

Long-term care insurance[edit]

   Main article: Long term care insurance

   Long-term care (LTC) insurance reimburses the policyholder for the cost
   of long-term or custodial care services designed to minimize or
   compensate for the loss of functioning due to age, disability or
   chronic illness.^[121] LTC has many surface similarities to long-term
   disability insurance. There are at least two fundamental differences,
   however. LTC policies cover the cost of certain types of chronic care,
   while long-term-disability policies replace income lost while the
   policyholder is unable to work. For LTC, the event triggering benefits
   is the need for chronic care, while the triggering event for disability
   insurance is the inability to work.^[118]

   Private LTC insurance is growing in popularity in the US. Premiums have
   remained relatively stable in recent years. However, the coverage is
   quite expensive, especially when consumers wait until retirement age to
   purchase it. The average age of new purchasers was 61 in 2005, and has
   been dropping.^[122]

Supplemental coverage[edit]

   Private insurers offer a variety of supplemental coverages in both the
   group and individual markets. These are not designed to provide the
   primary source of medical or disability protection for an individual,
   but can assist with unexpected expenses and provide additional peace of
   mind for insureds. Supplemental coverages include Medicare supplement
   insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, dental insurance, vision
   insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and specified
   disease insurance.^[22]

   Supplemental coverages are intended to:
     * Supplement a primary medical expense plan by paying for expenses
       that are excluded or subject to the primary plan's cost-sharing
       requirements (e.g., co-payments, deductibles, etc.);
     * Cover related expenses such as dental or vision care;
     * Assist with additional expenses that may be associated with a
       serious illness or injury.^[22]

Medicare Supplement Coverage (Medigap)[edit]

   Main article: Medigap

   Medicare Supplement policies are designed to cover expenses not covered
   (or only partially covered) by the "original Medicare" (Parts A & B)
   fee-for-service benefits. They are only available to individuals
   enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B. Medigap plans may be purchased on a
   guaranteed issue basis (no health questions asked) during a six-month
   open enrollment period when an individual first becomes eligible for
   Medicare. The benefits offered by Medigap plans are standardized.

Hospital indemnity insurance[edit]

   Hospital indemnity insurance provides a fixed daily, weekly or monthly
   benefit while the insured is confined in a hospital. The payment is not
   dependent on actual hospital charges, and is most commonly expressed as
   a flat dollar amount. Hospital indemnity benefits are paid in addition
   to any other benefits that may be available, and are typically used to
   pay out-of-pocket and non-covered expenses associated with the primary
   medical plan, and to help with additional expenses (e.g., child care)
   incurred while in the hospital.^[22]^[90]

Scheduled health insurance plans[edit]

   Scheduled health insurance plans are an expanded form of Hospital
   Indemnity plans. In recent years, these plans have taken the name
   mini-med plans or association plans. These plans may provide benefits
   for hospitalization, surgical, and physician services. However, they
   are not meant to replace a traditional comprehensive health insurance
   plan. Scheduled health insurance plans are more of a basic policy
   providing access to day-to-day health care such as going to the doctor
   or getting a prescription drug, but these benefits will be limited and
   are not meant to be effective for catastrophic events. Payments are
   based upon the plan's "schedule of benefits" and are usually paid
   directly to the service provider. These plans cost much less than
   comprehensive health insurance. Annual benefit maximums for a typical
   scheduled health insurance plan may range from $1,000 to $25,000.^[123]

Dental insurance[edit]

   Main article: Dental insurance

   Dental insurance helps pay for the cost of necessary dental care. Few
   medical expense plans include coverage for dental expenses. About 97%
   of dental benefits in the United States is provided through separate
   policies from carriers—both stand-alone and medical affiliates—that
   specialize in this coverage. Typically, these dental plans offer
   comprehensive preventive benefits. However, major dental expenses, such
   as crowns and root canals, are just partially covered. Also, most
   carriers offer a lower rate if you select a plan that utilizes their
   Network providers. Discount dental programs are also available. These
   do not constitute insurance, but provide participants with access to
   discounted fees for dental work.

Vision care insurance[edit]

   Main article: Vision insurance

   Vision care insurance provides coverage for routine eye care and is
   typically written to complement other medical benefits. Vision benefits
   are designed to encourage routine eye examinations and ensure that
   appropriate treatment is provided.^[22]

Specified disease[edit]

   Main article: Critical illness insurance

   Specified disease provides benefits for one or more specifically
   identified conditions. Benefits can be used to fill gaps in a primary
   medical plan, such as co-payments and deductibles, or to assist with
   additional expenses such as transportation and child care costs.^[22]

Accidental death and dismemberment insurance[edit]

   Main article: Accidental death and dismemberment insurance

   AD&D insurance is offered by group insurers and provides benefits in
   the event of accidental death. It also provides benefits for certain
   specified types of bodily injuries (e.g., loss of a limb or loss of
   sight) when they are the direct result of an accident.^[22]
     * Insurance companies have high administrative costs.^[124] Private
       health insurers are a significant portion of the U.S. economy
       directly employing (in 2004) almost 470,000 people at an average
       salary of $61,409.^[125]

     * Health insurance companies are not actually providing traditional
       insurance, which involves the pooling of risk, because the vast
       majority of purchasers actually do face the harms that they are
       "insuring" against. Instead, as Edward Beiser and Jacob Appel have
       separately argued, health insurers are better thought of as
       low-risk money managers who pocket the interest on what are really
       long-term healthcare savings accounts.^[126]^[127]

     * According to a study by a pro-health reform group published
       February 11, the nation's largest five health insurance companies
       posted a 56 percent gain in 2009 profits over 2008. The insurers
       (Wellpoint, UnitedHealth, Cigna, Aetna and Humana) cover the
       majority of Americans with health insurance.^[128]
