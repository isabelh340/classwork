   President Ronald Reagan being administered the oath of office by Chief
   Justice Warren E. Burger on January 21, 1985.

   The oath of office of the President of the United States is an oath or
   affirmation required by the United States Constitution before the
   President begins the execution of the office. The wording is specified
   in Article Two, Section One, Clause Eight:

     Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the
     following Oath or Affirmation:— “I do solemnly swear (or affirm)
     that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
     States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and
     defend the Constitution of the United States.”

Administrator of the oath[edit]

   While the Constitution does not mandate that anyone in particular
   should administer the oath, the oath is typically administered by the
   Chief Justice, but sometimes by another federal or state judge (George
   Washington was first sworn in by Robert Livingston, the chancellor of
   the State of New York in 1789, while Calvin Coolidge was first sworn in
   by his father, a Justice of the Peace and a Vermont notary public in
   1923). By convention, incoming Presidents raise their right hand and
   place the left on a Bible or other book while taking the oath of
   office.

   William R. King is the only executive official sworn into office on
   foreign soil. By special act of Congress, he was allowed to take his
   oath of the office of the Vice President on March 24, 1853 in Cuba,
   where he had gone because of his poor health.^[1] He died 25 days
   later.

   From 1789 through 2013, the swearing-in has been administered by 15
   Chief Justices, one Associate Justice, three federal judges, two New
   York state judges, and one notary public. To date the only person to
   swear in a president who was not a judge was John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.,
   Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary whose home the then-Vice President
   was visiting in 1923 when he learned of the death of President Warren
   G. Harding.

   Sarah T. Hughes is the only woman to administer the oath of office. She
   was a U.S. District Court judge who swore Lyndon B. Johnson into office
   on Air Force One after John F. Kennedy's assassination.

Option of taking an oath or an affirmation[edit]

   The Constitutional language gives the option to "affirm" instead of
   "swear". While the reasons for this are not documented, it may relate
   to certain Christians, including Quakers, who apply this scripture
   literally: "But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
   heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your
   yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation" (James
   5:12, KJV).^[2] Franklin Pierce was the only president known to use the
   word "affirm" rather than "swear." Herbert Hoover is often listed to
   have used "affirm" as well, owing to his being a Quaker, but a newsreel
   taken of the ceremony indicates that the words used were "solemnly
   swear."^[3] Richard Nixon, who was also a Quaker, also swore, rather
   than affirm.^[4]^[5]

Forms of administering the oath[edit]

   There have been two forms of administering, and taking, the oath of
   office.

   Under the first form, now in disuse, the administrator articulated the
   constitutional oath in the form of a question, and modifying the
   wording from the first to the second person, as in, "Do you George
   Washington solemnly swear ..." and then requested an affirmation. At
   that point a response of "I do" or "I swear" completed the
   oath.^[citation needed]

   It is believed that this was the common procedure at least until the
   early 20th century. In 1881, the New York Times article covering the
   swearing in of Chester A. Arthur, reported that he responded to the
   question of accepting the oath with the words, "I will, so help me
   God."^[6] In 1929, Time magazine reported that the Chief Justice began
   the oath uttering, "You, Herbert Hoover, do you solemnly
   swear ...",^[7] Hoover replied with a simple "I do". (A Youtube video,
   found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAKm9G8ji8, confirms this.)

   Under the second, and current form, the administrator articulates the
   oath in the affirmative, and in the first person, so that the President
   takes the oath by repeating it verbatim.^[citation needed] Franklin
   Roosevelt, in 1933, stood silent as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes
   recited the entire oath, then repeated that oath from beginning to end
   himself (as indicated by http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHoSUBzO0f0).
   By the time of Harry Truman's inauguration in 1949, the practice was
   for the Chief Justice to utter the oath in chunks, with the
   President-elect repeating those chunks, until the oath was completed
   (as shown by http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR-rjy2FqFw).

   Many times the President-elect's name is added after the "I"; for
   example, "I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, do ... " Lyndon B. Johnson did not
   add his name when swearing his first oath of office after Kennedy's
   death since he was never asked to say his name; there is evidence that
   in all other inaugurations since Franklin D. Roosevelt's first, the
   name of the president was added to the oath.^[citation needed]

Use of Bibles[edit]

   Theodore Roosevelt did not use a Bible when taking the oath in 1901.
   Barack Obama, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Harry S. Truman, and Richard Nixon
   (also a Quaker) swore the oath on two Bibles. John Quincy Adams swore
   on a book of law, with the intention that he was swearing on the
   constitution.^[8] Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in on a Roman Catholic
   missal on Air Force One.^[9] Washington kissed the Bible
   afterwards,^[10] and subsequent presidents followed suit, up to and
   including Harry Truman,^[11] but Dwight D. Eisenhower broke that
   tradition by saying his own prayer instead of kissing the Bible.^[12]

Oath mishaps[edit]

   President Barack Obama being administered the oath of office by Chief
   Justice John Roberts for the second time, on January 21, 2009.
     * In 1909, when President William Howard Taft was sworn in, Chief
       Justice Melville Fuller misquoted the oath, but the error was not
       publicized at the time. The mistake was similar to the one Taft
       himself would make twenty years later when swearing in President
       Hoover. Recalling the incident, Taft wrote, "When I was sworn in as
       President by Chief Justice Fuller, he made a similar slip," and
       added, "but in those days when there was no radio, it was observed
       only in the Senate chamber where I took the oath."^[7]
     * In 1929, Taft, later the Chief Justice, garbled the oath when he
       swore in President Herbert Hoover using the words "preserve,
       maintain, and defend the Constitution", instead of "preserve,
       protect, and defend". The error was picked up by schoolgirl Helen
       Terwilliger on the radio. Taft eventually acknowledged his error,
       but did not think it was important, and Hoover did not retake the
       oath. In Taft's view, his departure from the text did not
       invalidate the oath.^[7]^[13]^[14]
     * In 1941, Charles Elmore Cropley, the clerk of the Supreme Court who
       held the Bible for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's third
       inauguration dropped the Bible after the oath was given. Photos
       detailing the mishap filled a full page of Life magazine the next
       week.^[citation needed]
     * In 1945, President Harry S Truman's bare initial caused an unusual
       slip when he first became president and took the oath. At a meeting
       in the Cabinet Room, Chief Justice Harlan Stone, apparently
       mistaken about the meaning of Truman's middle initial (which is not
       an abbreviation but rather the whole middle name in itself), began
       reading the oath by saying "I, Harry Shipp Truman...", Truman
       responded: "I, Harry S Truman,..."^[15]
     * In 1965, Chief Justice Earl Warren prompted Lyndon Johnson to say,
       "the Office of the Presidency of the United States".^[16]
     * In 2009, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, while administering the
       oath to Barack Obama, incorrectly recited part of the oath. Roberts
       prompted, "That I will execute the Office of President to the
       United States faithfully." Obama stopped at "execute," and waited
       for Roberts to correct himself. Roberts, after a false start, then
       followed Obama's "execute" with "faithfully", which results in
       "execute faithfully," which is also incorrect. Obama then repeated
       Roberts' initial, incorrect prompt, with the word "faithfully"
       after "United States."^[17]^[18] The oath was re-administered the
       next day by Roberts at the White House.^[19]^[20]

   Seven presidents have repeated their oath of office, for different
   reasons:
     * Presidents Chester A. Arthur (1881)^[21]^[22] and Calvin Coolidge
       (1923)^[23] took their first oath in a private venue (their
       residences), in the middle of the night, immediately after being
       notified of the death of a predecessor (James A. Garfield and
       Warren G. Harding, respectively). They later retook the oath after
       returning to Washington. In the case of Coolidge, there was an
       additional doubt whether an oath administered by a public notary
       (Coolidge's father) was valid.^[24]
     * Five presidents took a private oath when Inauguration Day fell on a
       Sunday, and then a second oath in a scheduled public ceremony on
       the next day (Monday): Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877 (who actually
       took the private oath on March 3, a Saturday, one day before his
       term started), Woodrow Wilson in 1917, Dwight Eisenhower in 1957,
       Ronald Reagan in 1985, and Barack Obama in
       2013.^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28]
     * On January 21, 2009, Chief Justice Roberts administered the
       presidential oath a second time to Barack Obama "out of an
       abundance of caution," according to the White House, because, when
       the oath was administered to President Obama the first time in the
       public inauguration ceremony, the word "faithfully" was misplaced.
       The second oath was administered in a simple, private ceremony in
       the Map Room of the White House.^[20]^[29]^[30]^[31] Obama's
       oath-retaking differed from all his predecessors' in that the
       private ceremony happened after the public one. Obama's two oaths
       in 2009 and his two oaths in 2013 tie him with President Franklin
       D. Roosevelt, each taking the oath four times, the most ever
       recorded.^[32]

"So help me God"[edit]

   Further information: So help me God § United States and Oath

   It is uncertain how many Presidents used a Bible or added the words "So
   help me God" at the end of the oath, or in their acceptance of the
   oath, as neither is required by law; unlike many other federal oaths
   which do include the phrase "So help me God."^[33] There is currently
   debate as to whether or not George Washington, the first president,
   added the phrase to his acceptance of the oath. No contemporary sources
   mention Washington as adding a religious codicil to his
   acceptance.^[34]

   The historical debate over who first used "So help me God," is marred
   by ignoring the two forms of giving the oath. The first, now in disuse,
   is when the administrator articulates the constitutional oath in the
   form of a question, as in, "Do you George Washington solemnly
   swear...", requesting an affirmation. At that point a response of "I
   do" or "I swear" completes the oath. Without verbatim transcripts, the
   scant existing evidence shows this was the common procedure at least
   until the early 20th century. In 1865 the Sacramento Daily Union
   covered the second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln finished
   his oath with "So help me God," and he kissed the bible.^[35] In 1881,
   the New York Times article covering the swearing in of Chester A.
   Arthur, reported that he responded to the question of accepting the
   oath with the words, "I will, so help me God".^[6] In 1929, Time
   magazine reported that the Chief Justice began the oath uttering, "You,
   Herbert Hoover, do you solemnly swear..."^[7] Hoover replied with a
   simple "I do".

   A Federal lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia by Michael Newdow
   on December 30, 2008 contended the second, current form of
   administration, where both the Chief Justice and the President
   articulate the oath, appending "So help me God", to be a breach of the
   Constitutional instructions. The suit distinguishes between the words
   spoken by the administrator, which must conform to the exact 35 words
   of the Constitution, and the President, who has a right to add a
   personal prayer, such as "So help me God."^[36]

   Chief Justice Roberts' reply was that his "prompting" for these four
   extra-constitutional words were to be recited "after" the oath of
   office, and not as a part of the oath as claimed in the suit. After
   rendering the oath to President Barack Obama, Roberts prompted with a
   question "So help you God?", to which the President responded, "So help
   me God."^[37]

   The first Congress explicitly prescribed the phrase "So help me God" in
   oaths under the Judiciary Act of 1789 for all U.S. judges and officers
   other than the President. It was prescribed even earlier under the
   various first state constitutions^[38] as well as by the Second
   Continental Congress in 1776.^[39]^[40] Although the phrase is
   mandatory in these oaths, the said Act also allows for the option that
   the phrase be omitted by the officer, in which case it would be called
   an affirmation instead of an oath: "Which words, so help me God, shall
   be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an
   oath."^[41] In contrast, the oath of the President is the only oath
   specified in the Constitution. It does not include the closing phrase
   "So help me God", and it also allows for the optional form of an
   affirmation which is not considered an oath. In practice, however, most
   Presidents, at least during the last century, have opted to take the
   oath (rather than an affirmation), to use a Bible to do so, and also to
   close the oath with the customary phrase.

   The earliest known source indicating Washington added "So help me God"
   to his acceptance, not to the oath, is attributed to Washington Irving,
   aged six at the time of the inauguration, and first appears 65 years
   after the event.^[42]

   The only contemporary account that repeats the oath in full, a report
   from the French consul, Comte de Moustier, states only the
   constitutional oath,^[43] without reference to Washington's adding "So
   Help Me God" to his acceptance.

   Evidence is lacking to support the claim that Presidents between
   Washington and Abraham Lincoln used the phrase "So help me God." A
   contemporaneous newspaper account of Lincoln's 1865 inauguration states
   that Lincoln appended the phrase "So help me God" to the oath.^[44]
   This newspaper report is followed by another account, provided later in
   the same year after Lincoln's death (April 15, 1865), that Lincoln said
   "So help me God" during his oath.^[45] The evidence pertaining to the
   1865 inauguration is much stronger than that pertaining to Lincoln's
   1861 use of the phrase. Several sources claim that Lincoln said "So
   help me God" at his 1861 inauguration, yet these sources were not
   contemporaneous to the event.^[46]^[47] During the speech, Lincoln
   stated that his oath was "registered in Heaven",^[48] something some
   have taken as indicating he likely uttered the phrase "So help me God."
   Conversely, there was a claim made by A.M. Milligan (a Presbyterian
   minister who advocated for an official Christian U.S. government) that
   letters were sent to Abraham Lincoln asking him to swear to God during
   his inaugurations, and Lincoln allegedly wrote back saying that God's
   name was not in the Constitution, and he could not depart from the
   letter of that instrument.^[49]^[50]

   Other than the president of the U.S., many politicians (including
   Jefferson Davis, sworn in as president of the Confederate States of
   America in 1861) used the phrase "So help me God" when taking their
   oaths.^[51] Likewise, all federal judges and executive officers were
   required as early as 1789 by statute to include the phrase unless they
   affirmed, in which case the phrase must be omitted.^[52]

   Given that nearly every President-elect since President Franklin D.
   Roosevelt has recited the codicil, it is likely that the majority of
   presidents-elect have uttered the phrase^[53] (as well as some vice
   presidents, while taking their oaths). However, as President Theodore
   Roosevelt chose to conclude his oath with the phrase "And thus I
   swear," it seems that this current of tradition was not overwhelmingly
   strong even as recently as the turn of the twentieth century. Only
   Franklin Pierce has chosen to affirm rather than swear.^[54] It is
   often asserted that Herbert Hoover also affirmed, because he was a
   Quaker, but newspaper reports before his inauguration state his
   intention to swear rather than affirm.^[55]

List of oath takings[edit]

   Map showing locations where the oath of office was first taken, marked

   where presidencies ended are marked with a red 'X' (or a red dot for
   normal transitions). The nine sets of names shown in black are the ones
   in which transition took place prior to completion of the term, with
   four due to death by illness, four due to assassination (names
   underlined in grey), and one resignation (noted by a superscript 'R').
   Inset at the bottom of the map is a crop from the Constitution (see
