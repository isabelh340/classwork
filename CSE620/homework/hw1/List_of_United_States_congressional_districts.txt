List of United States congressional districts

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   For a list by area, see List of United States congressional districts
   by area.
   Congressional districts for the 113th United States Congress
   All 435 voting seats of the current House shown grouped by state,
   largest to smallest
   2010 Census change:
   Change in apportionment of congressional districts, starting in 2013,
   as a result of the 2010 census
   2000 Census change:
   Change in apportionment of congressional districts, from 2003 to 2013,
   as a result of the 2000 census

   This is a complete list of congressional districts for representation
   in the United States House of Representatives. The quantity
   (apportionment) and boundaries (redistricting) of districts are
   determined after each census, although in some cases states have
   changed the boundaries more than once per census. This list includes
   the 435 current and over 200 obsolete districts. For example, since the
   2000 census, Nebraska has had three districts, but it used to have as
   many as six. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Texas had
   32 districts, but has since added four due to reapportionment as a
   result of the 2010 census. Other states have lost districts since the
   number of congressional seats has been set at 435 by statute. Also
   included here are non-voting delegations: six current and four
   obsolete.

   The boundaries of districts often shift with each redistricting. Over
   time, the region and demographics represented in a district can change
   substantially. Furthermore, districts sometimes retain the same
   boundaries while changing their district numbers.
