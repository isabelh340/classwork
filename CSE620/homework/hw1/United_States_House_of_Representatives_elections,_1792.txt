   Elections to the United States House of Representatives for the 3rd
   Congress were held in 1792 and 1793, coinciding with the re-election of
   George Washington as President. While Washington ran for president as
   an independent, his followers (more specifically, the supporters of
   Alexander Hamilton) formed the nation's first organized political
   party, the Federalist Party, whose members and sympathizers are
   identified as pro-Administration on this page. In response, followers
   of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison created the opposition
   Democratic-Republican Party, who are identified as anti-Administration
   on this page. The Federalists promoted urbanization, industrialization,
   mercantilism, centralized government, and a broad interpretation of the
   United States Constitution. In contrast, Democratic-Republicans
   supported the ideal of an agrarian republic made up of self-sufficient
   farmers and small, localized governments with limited power.

   Despite nearly unanimous support for Washington as a presidential
   candidate, Jeffersonian ideas edged out Hamiltonian principles at the
   ballot box for congressional candidates, with the
   Democratic-Republicans taking 24 seats more than they had prior to the
   organization of their political movement. Most of the increase was due
   to the addition of new seats in Western regions as a result of the
   United States census of 1790. Dominated by agrarian culture, these
   Western territories offered strong support to Democratic-Republican
   congressional candidates. As a result, they secured a thin majority in
   the legislature.

Election summaries[edit]

   In this period, each state fixed its own date for a congressional
   general election, as early as August 1792 (in New Hampshire and Rhode
   Island) and as late as September 1793 (in Kentucky). In some states,
   the congressional delegation was not elected until after the legal
   start of the Congress (on the 4th day of March in the odd-numbered
   year), but as the first session of Congress typically began in November
   or December, the elections took place before Congress actually met. The
   3rd Congress first met on December 2, 1793.

   These were the first elections held after reapportionment following the
   first census. Thirty-six new seats were added,^[1] with 1 state losing
   1 seat, 3 states having no change, and the remaining 11 states gaining
   between 1 and 9 seats. This was the first apportionment based on actual
   census data, the apportionment for the 1st and 2nd Congresses being set
   by the Constitution using estimated populations.

Delaware[edit]

   Main article: United States House of Representatives election in
   Delaware, 1792

   Delaware's apportionment did not change following the Census of 1790.
   As in the 1st and 2nd Congresses, each voter cast votes for two
   separate candidates, at least one of whom had to be from a different
   county as the voter.

   John Patten (A) was initially declared the winner, but the election was
   challenged by Henry Latimer. The results of the election were
   subsequently reversed and Henry Latimer (P) took Delaware's seat in the
   Third Congress

Georgia[edit]

   Following the Census of 1790, Georgia's apportionment was decreased
   from 3 seats to 2 (the only state whose representation decreased after
   the Census of 1790). Georgia switched from separate districts to
   at-large seats.

   replaced in a special election by Benjamin Edwards (P).

Massachusetts[edit]

   Following the Census of 1790, Massachusetts' representation increased
   from 8 to 14 Representatives and was redistricted into 4 plural
   districts, plus a single at-large district. The 4th district covered
   the District of Maine (the modern-day State of Maine). The plural
   districts were concurrent tickets rather than a single general ticket,
   though the 1st and 2nd districts appear to have also had a general
   ticket alongside the more specific tickets.

   As before, a majority was required for election, in those districts
   where a majority was not achieved, additional ballots were required.

   York, 1793

   Due to re-apportionment following the Census of 1790, New York's
   congressional delegation grew from 6 to 10. Three incumbents ran for
   re-election, two of whom won, and the other three incumbents retired.
   With the increase following re-apportionment, this left seven open

Pennsylvania[edit]

   Main article: United States House of Representatives election in
   Pennsylvania, 1792

   Pennsylvania switched from using districts to electing its
   representatives on an at-large basis for the 3rd Congress, just as it
   had done for the 1st Congress. This would be the last time that
   Pennsylvania would elect all of its Representatives at-large. Due to
   re-apportionment following the Census of 1790, Pennsylvania's
   delegation increased from 8 representatives to 13.

Vermont[edit]

   Vermont's had no apportionment in the House of Representatives before
   the census of 1790 because it was not admitted to the Union until 1791.
   Vermont's election laws at the time required a majority to win election
   to the House of Representatives. If no candidate won a majority, a
   runoff election was held, which happened in Vermont's 1st district.
