   Gun politics is a controversial area of American politics that is
   primarily defined by the actions of two groups: gun control and gun
   rights activists. These groups often disagree on the interpretation of
   laws and court cases related to firearms as well as about the effects
   of gun control on crime and public safety.^[1]^:7

   Since the 1990s, debates regarding firearm availability and gun
   violence in the U.S. have been characterized by concerns about the
   right to bear arms, such as found in the Second Amendment to the U.S.
   Constitution, and the responsibility of the government to serve the
   needs of its citizens and to prevent crime and deaths. Gun control
   supporters say that broad or unrestricted gun rights inhibit the
   government from fulfilling that responsibility.^[2]^:1–3^[3] Gun rights
   supporters promote firearms for self-defense, hunting, and sporting
   activities.^[4]^:96 Gun control advocates state that keeping guns out
   of the hands of criminals results in safer communities, while gun
   rights advocates state that firearm ownership by law-abiding citizens
   reduces crime. A 2003 study by the Centers for Disease Control called
   for further study because there was insufficient evidence to determine
   the effectiveness of firearms laws with regards to violent
   outcomes.^[5]

   Gun legislation in the United States is constrained by judicial
   interpretations of the Constitution. In 1789, the United States adopted
   the Second Amendment, and in 1868 adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. The
   effect of those two amendments on gun politics was the subject of
   landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2008 and 2010, that upheld the
   right for individuals to possess guns for self-defense.

History[edit]

   The American hunting tradition comes from a time when the United States
   was an agrarian, subsistence nation where hunting was a profession for
   some, an auxiliary source of food for some settlers, and also a
   deterrence to animal predators. A connection between shooting skills
   and survival among rural American men was in many cases a necessity and
   a 'rite of passage' for those entering manhood.^[1]^:9 Today, hunting
   survives as a central sentimental component of a gun culture as a way
   to control animal populations across the country, regardless of modern
   trends away from subsistence hunting and rural living.^[3]

   The militia/frontiersman spirit derives from an early American
   dependence on arms to protect themselves from foreign armies and
   hostile Native Americans. Survival depended upon everyone being capable
   of using a weapon. Prior to the American Revolution there was neither
   budget nor manpower nor government desire to maintain a full-time army.
   Therefore, the armed citizen-soldier carried the responsibility.
   Service in militia, including providing one's own ammunition and
   weapons, was mandatory for all men, just as registering for military
   service upon turning eighteen is today. Yet, as early as the 1790s, the
   mandatory universal militia duty evolved gradually to voluntary militia
   units and a reliance on a regular army. Throughout the 19th century the
   institution of the organized civilian militia began to decline.^[1]^:10
   The unorganized civilian militia, however, still remains even in
   current U.S. law, consisting of essentially everyone from age 17 to 45,
   while also including former military officers up to age 64, as codified
   in 10 U.S.C. § 311.

   Closely related to the militia tradition is the frontier tradition,
   with the need for self-protection pursuant to westward expansion and
   the extension of the American frontier.^[1]^:10–11 Though it has not
   been a necessary part of daily survival for over a century,
   "generations of Americans continued to embrace and glorify it as a
   living inheritance—as a permanent ingredient of this nation's style and
   culture".^[6]^:21

Colonial era through the 19th century[edit]

   Gun politics date to Colonial America. (Lexington Minuteman,
   representing John Parker, by Henry Hudson Kitson stands at the town
   green of Lexington, Massachusetts.)

   Most American school children learn about the tyranny of King George
   III: taxation without representation.^[7]^[8] In the years prior to the
   American Revolution, the British, in response to the colonists'
   unhappiness over increasingly direct control and taxation of the
   colonies, imposed a gunpowder embargo on the colonies in an attempt to
   lessen the ability of the colonists to resist British encroachments
   into what the colonies regarded as local matters. Two direct attempts
   to disarm the colonial militias fanned what had been a smoldering
   resentment of British interference into the fires of war.^[9]

   These two incidents were the attempt to confiscate the cannon of the
   Concord and Lexington militias, leading to the Battles of Lexington and
   Concord of April 19, 1775, and the attempt, on April 20, to confiscate
   militia powder stores in the armory of Williamsburg, Virginia, which
   led to the Gunpowder Incident and a face off between Patrick Henry and
   hundreds of militia members on one side and the Royal Governor of
   Virginia, Lord Dunmore, and British seamen on the other. The Gunpowder
   Incident was eventually settled by paying the colonists for the
   powder.^[9]

   According to historian Saul Cornell, states passed some of the first
   gun control laws, beginning with Kentucky's law to "curb the practice
   of carrying concealed weapons in 1813." There was opposition and, as a
   result, the individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment
   began and grew in direct response to these early gun control laws, in
   keeping with this new "pervasive spirit of individualism." As noted by
   Cornell, "Ironically, the first gun control movement helped give birth
   to the first self-conscious gun rights ideology built around a
   constitutional right of individual self-defense."^[10]^:140–141

   The individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment first arose
   in Bliss v. Commonwealth (1822),^[11] which evaluated the right to bear
   arms in defense of themselves and the state pursuant to Section 28 of
   the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799). The right to bear arms in
   defense of themselves and the state was interpreted as an individual
   right, for the case of a concealed sword cane. This case has been
   described as about "a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed
   weapons [that] was violative of the Second Amendment".^[12]

   The first state court decision relevant to the "right to bear arms"
   issue was Bliss v. Commonwealth. The Kentucky court held that "the
   right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State
   must be preserved entire,..."^[13]^:161^[14]

   Also during the Jacksonian Era, the first collective right (or group
   right) interpretation of the Second Amendment arose. In State v.
   Buzzard (1842), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based,
   political right, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and
   upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas
   Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of this State
   shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common
   defense",^[15] while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the
   carrying of concealed weapons.

   The Arkansas high court declared "That the words 'a well regulated
   militia being necessary for the security of a free State', and the
   words 'common defense' clearly show the true intent and meaning of
   these Constitutions [i.e., Arkansas and U.S.] and prove that it is a
   political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State,
   in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it:
   This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor
   collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms." Joel Prentiss
   Bishop's influential Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes (1873)
   took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop
   characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine," as the orthodox view of the
   right to bear arms in American law.^[15]^[16]

   The two early state court cases, Bliss and Buzzard, set the fundamental
   dichotomy in interpreting the Second Amendment, i.e., whether it
   secured an individual right versus a collective right.^[citation

   With the Civil War ending, the question of the rights of freed slaves
   to carry arms and to belong to militia came to the attention of the
   federal courts. In response to the problems freed slaves faced in the
   Southern states, the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted.
   Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio, principal framer of the
   Fourteenth Amendment

   When the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted, Representative John A.
   Bingham of Ohio used the Court's own phrase "privileges and immunities
   of citizens" to include the first Eight Amendments of the Bill of
   Rights under its protection and guard these rights against state
   legislation.^[17]

   The debate in the Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil
   War also concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm
   the newly freed slaves. One particular concern was the disarming of
   former slaves.

   The Second Amendment attracted serious judicial attention with the
   Reconstruction era case of United States v. Cruikshank which ruled that
   the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did
   not cause the Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, to limit
   the powers of the State governments, stating that the Second Amendment
   "has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national
   government."

   Akhil Reed Amar notes in the Yale Law Journal, the basis of Common Law
   for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which would
   include the Second Amendment, "following John Randolph Tucker's famous
   oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist Haymarket Riot case, Spies
   v. Illinois":

     Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as
     limitations on Federal power, yet in so far as they secure and
     recognize fundamental rights—common law rights—of the man, they make
     them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United
     States...^[18]

20th century[edit]

First half of 20th century[edit]

   Since the late 19th century, with three key cases from the
   pre-incorporation era, the U.S. Supreme Court consistently ruled that
   the Second Amendment (and the Bill of Rights) restricted only Congress,
   and not the States, in the regulation of guns.^[19] Scholars predicted
   that the Court's incorporation of other rights suggested that they may
   incorporate the Second, should a suitable case come before them.^[20]

National Firearms Act[edit]

   Main article: National Firearms Act

   The first major federal firearms law passed in the 20th century was the
   National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934. It was passed after
   Prohibition-era gangsterism peaked with the Saint Valentine's Day
   massacre of 1929. The era was famous for criminal use of firearms such
   as the Thompson submachine gun (Tommy gun) and sawed-off shotgun. Under
   the NFA, machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and other
   weapons fall under the regulation and jurisdiction of the Bureau of
   Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) as described by Title II.^[21]

United States v. Miller[edit]

   Main article: United States v. Miller

   In United States v. Miller^[22] the Court did not address
   incorporation, but whether a sawed-off shotgun "has some reasonable
   relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated
   militia."^[20] In overturning the indictment against Miller, the U.S.
   District Court for the Western District of Arkansas stated that the
   National Firearms Act of 1934, "offend[ed] the inhibition of the Second
   Amendment to the Constitution." The federal government then appealed
   directly to the Supreme Court. On appeal the federal government did not
   object to Miller's release since he had died by then, seeking only to
   have the trial judge's ruling on the unconstitutionality of the federal
   law overturned. Under these circumstances, neither Miller nor his
   attorney appeared before the Court to argue the case. The Court only
   heard argument from the federal prosecutor. In its ruling, the Court
   overturned the trial court and upheld the NFA.^[23]

Second half of 20th century[edit]

   President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Gun Control Act of 1968 into law.

   The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) was passed after the assassinations
   of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and
   African-American activists Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. in the
   1960s.^[1] The GCA focuses on regulating interstate commerce in
   firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except
   among licensed manufacturers, dealers, and importers. It also prohibits
   selling firearms to certain categories of individuals defined as
   "prohibited persons."
   Chaos outside the Washington Hilton Hotel after the 1981 assassination
   attempt on President Reagan. James Brady and police officer Thomas
   Delahanty lie wounded on the ground.

   The murder of musician John Lennon in 1980 and an assassination attempt
   on President Ronald Reagan in 1981 led to enactment of the Brady
   Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Law) in 1993 which established
   the national background check system to prevent certain restricted
   individuals from owning, purchasing, or transporting firearms.^[24] In
   an article supporting passage of such a law, retired chief justice
   Warren E. Burger wrote:

     Americans also have a right to defend their homes, and we need not
     challenge that. Nor does anyone seriously question that the
     Constitution protects the right of hunters to own and keep sporting
     guns for hunting game any more than anyone would challenge the right
     to own and keep fishing rods and other equipment for fishing – or to
     own automobiles. To 'keep and bear arms' for hunting today is
     essentially a recreational activity and not an imperative of
     survival, as it was 200 years ago. 'Saturday night specials' and
     machine guns are not recreational weapons and surely are as much in
     need of regulation as motor vehicles.^[25]

   In 1986, Congress passed the Firearm Owners Protection Act.^[26] It was
   supported by the National Rifle Association and individual gun rights
   advocates because it reversed many of the provisions of the GCA and
   protected gun owners' rights. It also banned ownership of unregistered
   fully automatic rifles and civilian purchase or sale of any such
   firearm made from that date forward.^[27]^[28]

   A Stockton, California, schoolyard shooting in 1989 led to passage of
   the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 (AWB or AWB 1994), which
   defined and banned the manufacture and transfer of "semiautomatic
   assault weapons" and "large capacity ammunition feeding device"s.^[29]

   According to journalist Chip Berlet, concerns about gun control laws
   along with outrage over two high profile incidents involving the ATF
   (Ruby Ridge in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993) mobilized the militia
   movement of citizens who feared that the federal government would begin
   to confiscate firearms.^[30]^[31]

   Though gun control is not strictly a partisan issue, there is generally
   more support for gun control legislation in the Democratic Party than
   in the Republican Party.^[32] The Libertarian Party, whose campaign
   platforms favor limited government, is outspokenly against gun
   control.^[33]

Advocacy groups[edit]

   The National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded to promote firearm
   competency in 1871. The NRA supported the NFA and, ultimately, the
   GCA.^[34] After the GCA, more strident groups, such as the Gun Owners
   of America (GOA), began to advocate for gun rights.^[35] According to
   the GOA, it was founded in 1975 when "the radical left introduced
   legislation to ban all handguns in California."^[36] The GOA and other
   national groups like the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF), Jews for
   the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO), and the Second Amendment
   Sisters (SAS), often take stronger stances than the NRA and criticize
   its history of support for some firearms legislation, such as GCA.
   These groups believe any compromise leads to greater
   restrictions.^[37]^:368^[38]^:172

   According to the authors of The Changing Politics of Gun Control
   (1998), in the late 1970s, the NRA changed its activities to
   incorporate political advocacy.^[39] Despite the impact on the
   volatility of membership, the politicization of the NRA has been
   consistent and the NRA-Political Victory Fund ranked as "one of the
   biggest spenders in congressional elections" as of 1998.^[39] According
   to the authors of The Gun Debate (2014), the NRA taking the lead on
   politics serves the gun industry's profitability. In particular when
   gun owners respond to fears of gun confiscation with increased
   purchases and by helping to isolate the industry from the misuse of its
   products used in shooting incidents.^[40]

   The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence began in 1974 as Handgun
   Control Inc. (HCI). Soon after, it formed a partnership with another
   fledgling group called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH) -
   later known as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV). The
   partnership did not last, as NCBH generally took a tougher stand on gun
   regulation than HCI.^[41]^:186 In the wake of the 1980 murder of John
   Lennon, HCI saw an increase of interest and fund raising and
   contributed $75,000 to congressional campaigns. Following the Reagan
   assassination attempt and the resultant injury of James Brady, Sarah
   Brady joined the board of HCI in 1985. HCI was renamed in 2001 to Brady
   Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.^[42]

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) restriction[edit]

   In 1996, Congress added language to the relevant appropriations bill
   which required "none of the funds made available for injury prevention
   and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be
   used to advocate or promote gun control."^[43] This language was added
   to prevent the funding of research by the CDC that gun rights
   supporters considered politically motivated and intended to bring about
   further gun control legislation. In particular, the NRA and other gun
   rights proponents objected to work supported by the National Center for
   Injury Prevention and Control, then run by Mark Rosenberg, including
   research authored by Arthur Kellermann.^[44]^[45]^[46]

21st century[edit]

   In October 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   published a report on the effectiveness of gun violence prevention
   strategies that concluded "Evidence was insufficient to determine the
   effectiveness of any of these laws."^[5]^:14 A similar survey of
   firearms research by the National Academy of Sciences arrived at nearly
   identical conclusions in 2004.^[47] In September of that year, the
   Assault Weapons Ban expired due to a sunset provision. Efforts by gun
   control advocates to renew the ban failed, as did attempts to replace
   it after it became defunct.

   The NRA opposed bans on handguns in Chicago, Washington D.C., and San
   Francisco, while supporting the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007
   (also known as the School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act),
   which strengthened requirements for background checks for firearm
   purchases.^[48] The GOA took issue with a portion of the bill, which
   they termed the "Veterans' Disarmament Act."^[49]

   Besides the GOA, other national gun rights groups continue to take a
   stronger stance than the NRA. These groups include the Second Amendment
   Sisters, Second Amendment Foundation, Jews for the Preservation of
   Firearms Ownership, and the Pink Pistols. New groups have also arisen,
   such as the Students for Concealed Carry, which grew largely out of
   safety-issues resulting from the creation of 'Gun-free' zones that were
   legislatively mandated amidst a response to widely publicized school
   shootings.

   In 2001, in United States v. Emerson, the Fifth Circuit became the
   first federal appeals court to recognize an individual's right to own
   guns. In 2007, in Parker v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit
   became the first federal appeals court to strike down a gun control law
   on Second Amendment grounds.^[50]

District of Columbia v. Heller[edit]

   Main article: District of Columbia v. Heller

   In June 2008, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court
   upheld by a 5-4 vote the Parker decision striking down the D.C. gun
   law. Heller ruled that Americans have an individual right to possess
   firearms, irrespective of membership in a militia, "for traditionally
   lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."^[51] However,
   in delivering the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia made clear
   that, like other rights, the right to bear arms is limited. He wrote:

     Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is
     not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
     whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons
     prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state
     analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on
     longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons
     and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in
     sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws
     imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of
     arms.^[52]^[53]

   The four dissenting justices said that the majority had broken
   established precedent on the Second Amendment,^[54] and took the
   position that the Amendment refers to an individual right, but in the
   context of militia service.^[55]^[56]^[57]^[58]

McDonald v. Chicago[edit]

   Main article: McDonald v. Chicago

   In June 2010, a Chicago law that banned handguns was struck down. The
   ruling stated that "The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment
   right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States."

Advocacy groups, PACs, and lobbying[edit]

   One way advocacy groups influence politics is through "outside
   spending," using political action committees (PACs) and 501(c)(4)
   organizations.^[59] PACs and 501(c)(4)s raise and spend money to affect
   elections.^[60]^[61] PACs pool campaign contributions from members and
   donate those funds to candidates for political office.^[62] Super PACs,
   created in 2010, are prohibited from making direct contributions to
   candidates or parties, but influence races by running ads for or
   against specific candidates.^[63] Both gun control and gun rights
   advocates use these types of organizations.

   The NRA's Political Victory Fund super PAC spent $11.2 million in the
   2012 election cycle,^[64] and as of April 2014, it had raised $13.7
   million for 2014 elections.^[65] Michael Bloomberg's gun-control super
   PAC, Independence USA, spent $8.3 million in 2012^[66]^[67] and $6.3
   million in 2013.^[68] Americans for Responsible Solutions, a PAC
   started by retired Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, raised $12 million
   in 2013,^[69] and plans to raise $16 to $20 million by the 2014
   elections.^[70] The group's treasurer said that the funds would be
   enough to compete with the NRA "on an even-keel basis."^[70]

   Another way advocacy groups influence politics is through lobbying;
   some groups use lobbying firms, while others employ in-house lobbyists.
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, gun politics groups
   with the most lobbyists in 2013 were: the NRA's Institute for
   Legislative Action (NRA-ILA); Mayors Against Illegal Guns (MAIG); the
   National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF); and the Brady
   Campaign.^[71] Gun rights groups spent over $15.1 million lobbying in
   Washington D.C. in 2013, with the National Association for Gun Rights
   (NAGR) spending $6.7 million, and the NRA spending $3.4 million.^[72]
   Gun control groups spent $2.2 million, with MAIG spending $1.7 million,
   and the Brady Campaign spending $250,000 in the same period.^[73]

3D printed firearms[edit]

   Main article: 3D printed firearms

   In August 2012, an open source group called Defense Distributed
   launched a project to design and release a blueprint for a handgun that
   could be downloaded from the Internet and manufactured using a 3-D
   printer.^[74]^[75] In May 2013, the group made public the STL files for
   the world's first fully 3D printable gun, the Liberator .380 single
   shot pistol.^[76]^[77]^[78]

Proposals by Obama Administration[edit]

   On January 16, 2013, in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School
   shooting and other mass shootings, President Barack Obama announced a
   plan for reducing gun violence in four parts: closing background check
   loopholes; banning assault weapons and large capacity magazines; making
   schools safer; and increasing access to mental health
   services.^[79]^[80]^:2 The plan included proposals for new laws to be
   passed by Congress, and a series of executive actions not requiring
   Congressional approval.^[79]^[81]^[82] No new federal gun control
   legislation was passed as a result of these proposals.^[83]

   The executive actions included:
     * Improve the data used for the background check system for gun
       sales;
     * Direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research
       gun violence;^[84]
     * Provide incentives for schools to hire school resource officers;
     * Give law enforcement additional tools to prevent and prosecute gun
       crime.

2013 United Nations Arms Treaty[edit]

   See also: Arms Trade Treaty § Content

   The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is a multilateral treaty that regulates the
   international trade in conventional weapons, which has not entered into
   force. Work on the treaty commenced in 2006 with negotiations for its
   content conducted at a global conference under the auspices of the
   United Nations from July 2–27, 2012, in New York.^[85] As it was not
   possible to reach an agreement on a final text at that time, a new
   meeting for the conference was scheduled for March 18–28, 2013.^[86] On
   2 April 2013, the UN General Assembly adopted the ATT.^[87]^[88] The
   treaty was opened for signing on June 3, 2013 and has been signed by
   115 states and ratified or acceded to by 8. It will enter into force
   after it has been ratified or acceded to by 50 states.^[89]

   On September 25, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry signed the ATT on
   behalf of the Obama administration. This was a reversal of the position
   of the Bush administration which had chosen not to participate in the
   treaty negotiations. Then in October a bipartisan group of fifty
   Senators and 181 Representatives released concurrent letters to
   President Barack Obama pledging their opposition to ratification of the
   ATT. The group is led by Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and
   Representatives Mike Kelly (R-Pennsylvania) and Collin Peterson
   (D-Minnesota). Following these two letters, four Democrat Senators sent
   a separate letter to the President stating that "because of unaddressed
   concerns that this Treaty’s obligations could undermine our nation’s
   sovereignty and the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans
   [they] would oppose the Treaty if it were to come before the U.S.
   Senate." The four Senators are Jon Tester (D-Montana), Max Baucus
   (D-Montana), Heidi Heitkamp (D-North Dakota), and Joe Donnelly
   (D-Indiana).^[90]^[91]

   Supporters of the treaty claim that the treaty is needed to help
   protect millions around the globe in danger of human rights abuses.
   Frank Jannuzi of Amnesty International USA states, "This treaty says
   that nations must not export arms and ammunition where there is an
   'overriding risk' that they will be used to commit serious human rights
   violations. It will help keep arms out of the hands of the wrong
   people: those responsible for upwards of 1,500 deaths worldwide every
   day."^[92] Secretary Kerry was quoted as saying that his signature
   would "help deter the transfer of conventional weapons used to carry
   out the world's worst crimes."^[93] As of December 2013, the U.S. has
   not ratified or acceded to the treaty.

Public opinion[edit]

Polls[edit]

   March on Washington for Gun Control in January 2013

   Huffington Post reported in September 2013 that 48% of Americans said
   gun laws should be made more strict, while 16% said they should be made
   less strict and 29% said there should be no change.^[94] Similarly, a
   Gallup poll found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from
   58% after the Newtown shooting, to 49% in September 2013.^[94] Both the
   Huffington Post poll and the Gallup poll were conducted after the
   Washington Navy Yard shooting.^[94] Meanwhile, the Huffington Post poll
   found that 40% of Americans believe stricter gun laws would prevent
   future mass shootings, while 52% said changing things would not make a
   difference.^[94] The same poll also found that 57% of Americans think
   better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass
   shootings than stricter gun laws, while 29% said the opposite.^[94]

Gallup poll[edit]

   The Gallup organization regularly polls Americans on their views on
   guns. As of December 22, 2012:^[95]
     * 44% supported a ban on "semi-automatic guns known as assault
       rifles."
     * 92% supported background checks on all gun-show gun sales.
     * 62% supported a ban on "high-capacity ammunition magazines that can
       contain more than 10 rounds."

   As of April 25, 2013:^[96]
     * 56% supported reinstating and strengthening the assault weapons ban
       of 1994.
     * 83% supported requiring background checks for all gun purchases.
     * 51% supported limiting the sale of ammunition magazines to those
       with 10 rounds or less.

   As of October 6, 2013:^[97]
     * 49% felt that gun laws should be more strict.
     * 74% opposed civilian handgun bans.
     * 37% said they had a gun in their home.
     * 27% said they personally owned a gun.
     * 60% of gun owners have guns for personal safety/protection, 36% for
       hunting, 13% for recreation/sport, 8% for target shooting, 5% for
       Second Amendment right.

   As of January 2014:^[98]
     * 40% are satisfied with the current state of gun laws, 55% are
       dissatisfied
     * 31% want stricter control, 16% want less strict laws

National Rifle Association[edit]

   A member poll conducted for the NRA between January 13 and January 14,
   2013 found:^[99]
     * 90.7% of members favor "Reforming our mental health laws to help
       keep firearms out of the hands of people with mental illness." (A
       majority of 86.4% believe that strengthening laws this way would be
       more effective at preventing mass murders than banning
       semi-automatic rifles.)
     * 92.2% of NRA members oppose gun confiscation via mandatory buy-back
       laws.
     * 88.5% oppose banning semi-automatic firearms, firearms that shoot
       one bullet per trigger pull.
     * 92.6% oppose a law requiring gun owners to register with the
       federal government.
     * 92.0% oppose a federal law banning the sale of firearms between
       private citizens.

       security professionals in every school.
     * 72.5% agreed that President Obama’s ultimate goal is the
       confiscation of many firearms that are currently legal.

   Place of living of respondents:
     * 35.4% A rural area
     * 26.4% A small town
     * 22.9% A suburban area

Political arguments[edit]

Rights-based arguments[edit]

   Rights-based arguments involve the most fundamental question about gun
   control: to what degree the government has the authority to regulate
   guns.

Fundamental right[edit]

   The primary author of the United States Bill of Rights, James Madison,
   considered them — including a right to keep and bear arms — to be
   "fundamental." In 1788, he wrote: “The political truths declared in
   that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental
   maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the
   national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and
   passion.”^[100]^[101]

   The view that gun ownership is a fundamental right was affirmed by the
   U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). The Court
   stated: "By the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become
   fundamental for English subjects."^[102] The Court observed that the
   English Bill of Rights of 1689 had listed a right to arms as one of the
   fundamental rights of Englishmen.

   When the Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment in McDonald v.
   Chicago (2010), it looked to the year 1868, when the amendment was
   ratified, and said that most states had provisions in their
   constitutions explicitly protecting this right. The Court concluded:
   "It is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment
   counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights
   necessary to our system of ordered liberty."^[103]^[104]

Second Amendment rights[edit]

   The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted on
   December 15, 1791, states:

     A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
     state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
     infringed.^[105]

   Prior to District of Columbia v. Heller, in the absence of a clear
   court ruling, there was debate about whether or not the Second
   Amendment included an individual right.^[106] In Heller, the Court
   concluded that there is indeed such a right, but a limited one.^[106]
   Although the decision was not unanimous, all justices endorsed an
   individual right viewpoint, but differed on the scope of that
   right.^[55]^[56]

   Before Heller many gun rights advocates said that the Second Amendment
   protects an individual right to own guns. They stated that the phrase
   "the people" in that amendment applies to all individuals rather than
   an organized collective, and that the phrase "the people" means the
   same thing in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th
   Amendments.^[107]^:55–87^[108]^[109] They also said the Second's
   placement in the Bill of Rights defines it as an individual
   right.^[110]^[111] As part of the Heller decision, the majority
   endorsed the view that the Second Amendment protects an individual, yet
   limited, right to own guns. Political scientist Robert Spitzer and
   Supreme Court law clerk Gregory P. Magarian argue that this final
   decision by the Supreme Court was a misinterpretation of the U.S.
   Constitution.^[112]^[113]^[114]

   After the Heller decision there was an increased amount of attention on
   whether or not the Second Amendment applies to the states. In 2010 in
   the case of McDonald v. Chicago, the Supreme Court ruled that the
   Second Amendment's provisions do apply to the states (via the
   Fourteenth Amendment).

Defense of self and state[edit]

   The eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone (b. 1723),
   whose writings influenced the drafters of the U.S. Constitution,^[115]
   called self-defense "the primary law of nature" which (he said)
   man-made law cannot take away.^[116] Following Blackstone, the American
   jurist St. George Tucker (b. 1752) wrote that "the right of
   self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has
   been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest
   limits possible."^[117]

   In both Heller (2008) and McDonald (2010) the Supreme Court deemed that
   the right of self-defense is at least partly protected by the United
   States Constitution. The court left details of that protection to be
   worked out in future court cases.^[118]

   The two primary interest groups regarding this issue are the Brady
   Campaign and the National Rifle Association.^[119] They have clashed,
   for example, regarding stand-your-ground laws which give individuals a
   legal right to use guns for defending themselves without any duty to
   retreat from a dangerous situation.^[120] After the Supreme Court's
   2008 decision in Heller, the Brady Campaign indicated that it would
   seek reasonable gun laws “without infringing on the right of
   law-abiding persons to possess guns for self-defense.”^[121]

Security against tyranny[edit]

   Another aspect of gun rights ideology is that banning or even
   regulating gun ownership makes government tyranny more likely.^[122] A
   January 2013 Rasmussen Reports poll indicated that 65 percent of
   Americans believe the purpose of the Second Amendment is to "ensure
   that people are able to protect themselves from tyranny."^[123] A
   Gallup poll in October 2013 showed that 60 percent of American gun
   owners mention "personal safety/protection" as a reason for owning
   them, and 5 percent mention a "Second Amendment right," among other
   reasons.^[124] The anti-tyranny argument extends back to the days of
   colonial America and earlier in Great Britain.^[125]

   Various gun rights advocates and organizations, such as former governor
   Mike Huckabee,^[126] former Congressman Ron Paul,^[127] and Gun Owners
   of America,^[128] say that an armed citizenry is the population's last
   line of defense against tyranny by their own government. This belief
   was also familiar at the time the Constitution was written.^[129]^[130]
   A right of revolution was omitted from the Constitution, and instead
   the Constitution was designed to ensure a government deriving its power
   from the consent of the governed.^[131]

   Some gun rights advocates such as Stephen Halbrook and Wayne LaPierre
   believe that "Nazi gun control," and gun laws in other authoritarian
   regimes, contributed significantly to past tyranny and
   genocides.^[132]^:484^[133]^:87–8,167–8 This hypothesis is not
   supported by mainstream
   scholarship,^[134]^:412,414^[135]^:671,677^[136]^:728 though it is an
   element of a "security against tyranny" argument in U.S.
   politics.^[137]

   The Declaration of Independence mentions "the Right of the People to
   alter or to abolish" the government, and Abraham Lincoln's first
   inaugural address reiterated the "revolutionary right" of the
   people.^[138] In 1957, the legal scholar Roscoe Pound expressed a
   different view:^[139]^[140] He stated, "A legal right of the citizen to
   wage war on the government is something that cannot be admitted. ... In
   the urban industrial society of today a general right to bear efficient
   arms so as to be enabled to resist oppression by the government would
   mean that gangs could exercise an extra-legal rule which would defeat
   the whole Bill of Rights."

   Historian Don Higginbotham wrote that the well-regulated militia
   protected by the Second Amendment was more likely to put down
   rebellions than participate in them.^[141] American gun rights activist
   Larry Pratt says that the anti-tyranny argument for gun rights is
   supported by successful efforts in Guatemala and the Philippines to arm
   ordinary citizens against communist insurgency in the
   1980s.^[142]^[143] Gun-rights advocacy groups argue that the only way
   to enforce democracy is through having the means of
   resistance.^[107]^:55–87^[108]^[109] Militia-movement groups cite the
   Battle of Athens (Tennessee, 1946) as an example of citizens who
   "[used] armed force to support the Rule of Law" in what they said was a
   rigged county election.^[144] Then-senator John F. Kennedy wrote in
   1960 that, "it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental
   tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major
   danger to our nation...."^[145]

Public policy arguments[edit]

   Public policy arguments are based on the idea that the central purpose
   of government is to establish and maintain order. This is done through
   public policy, which Blackstone defined as "the due regulation and
   domestic order of the kingdom, whereby the inhabitants of the State,
   like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their
   general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighborhood, and good
   manners, and to be decent, industrious, and inoffensive in their
   respective stations."^[1]^:2–3

Gun violence debate[edit]

   Main article: Gun violence in the United States

   The public policy debates about gun violence include discussions about
   firearms deaths - including homicide, suicide, and unintentional deaths
   - as well as the impact of gun ownership, criminal and legal, on gun
   violence outcomes. In the United States in 2009 there were 3.0 recorded
   intentional homicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants.
   The U.S. ranks 28 in the world for gun homicides per capita.^[146]

   Within the gun politics debate, gun control and gun rights advocates
   disagree over the role that guns play in crime. Gun control advocates
   concerned about high levels of gun violence in the United States look
   to restrictions on gun ownership as a way to stem the violence and
   claim that increased gun ownership leads to higher levels of crime,
   suicide and other negative outcomes.^[147]^[148] Gun rights groups say
   that a well-armed citizenry prevents crime and that making civilian
   ownership of firearms illegal would increase the crime rate by making
   law-abiding citizens vulnerable to those who choose to disregard the
   law.^[149]^[150] They note that more people defend themselves with a
   gun every year than the police arrest for violent crimes and
   burglary^[151] and that private citizens legally shoot almost as many
   criminals as public police officers do.^[152]

Criminal violence[edit]

   See also: Crime in the United States and List of countries by
   intentional homicide rate

   There is an open debate regarding a causal connection (or the lack of
   one) between gun control and its affect on gun violence and other
   crimes. The numbers of lives saved or lost by gun ownership is debated
   by criminologists. Research difficulties include the difficulty of
   accounting accurately for confrontations in which no shots are fired
   and jurisdictional differences in the definition of "crime."

   A 2003 CDC study determined "The Task Force found insufficient evidence
   to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or
   combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes."^[5] They go on to
   state "a finding of insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness
   should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness but rather as
   an indicator that additional research is needed before an intervention
   can be evaluated for its effectiveness."

   In 2009, the Public Health Law Research program,^[153] an independent
   organization, published several evidence briefs summarizing the
   research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public
   health, that concern the effectiveness of various laws related to gun
   safety. Among their findings:
     * There is not enough evidence to establish the effectiveness of
       "shall issue" laws, as distinct from "may issue" laws, as a public
       health intervention to reduce violent crime.^[154]

     * There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of
       waiting period laws as public health interventions aimed at
       preventing gun-related violence and suicide.^[155]

     * Although child access prevention laws may represent a promising
       intervention for reducing gun-related morbidity and mortality among
       children, there is currently insufficient evidence to validate
       their effectiveness as a public health intervention aimed at
       reducing gun-related harms.^[156]

     * There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of
       such bans as public health interventions aimed at reducing
       gun-related harms.^[157]

     * There is insufficient evidence to validate the effectiveness of
       firearm licensing and registration requirements as legal
       interventions aimed a reducing fire-arm related harms.^[158]

Homicide[edit]

   With only 5% of the world's population, U.S. residents own roughly 50%
   of the world's civilian-owned firearms.^[159] According to the UNODC,
   60% of U.S. homicides in 2009 were perpetrated using a firearm.^[160]
   U.S. homicides by firearm vary widely from state to state. In 2010, the
   lowest firearm homicide rates were in Vermont (0.3) and New Hampshire
   (0.4), and the highest were in the District of Columbia (16.0) and
   Louisiana (7.8).^[161]

   Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University, estimated that
   approximately 2.5 million people used their gun in self-defense or to
   prevent crime each year, often by merely displaying a weapon. The
   incidents that Kleck studied generally did not involve the firing of
   the gun and he estimates that as many as 1.9 million of those instances
   involved a handgun.^[162]

   One study found that homicide rates as a whole, especially those as a
   result of firearms use, are not always significantly lower in many
   other developed countries. Kleck wrote, "...cross-national comparisons
   do not provide a sound basis for assessing the impact of gun ownership
   levels on crime rates."^[163] One study published in the International
   Journal of Epidemiology, which found that for the year of 1998: "During
   the one-year study period (1998), 88,649 firearm deaths were reported.
   Overall firearm mortality rates are five to six times higher in
   high-income (HI) and upper middle-income (UMI) countries in the
   Americas (12.72) than in Europe (2.17) or Oceania (2.57) and 95 times
   higher than in Asia (0.13). The rate of firearm deaths in the United
   States (14.24 per 100,000) exceeds that of its economic counterparts
   (1.76) eightfold and that of UMI countries (9.69) by a factor of 1.5.
   Suicide and homicide contribute equally to total firearm deaths in the
   U.S., but most firearm deaths are suicides (71%) in HI countries and
   homicides (72%) in UMI countries."^[164]

Suicide[edit]

   Firearms accounted for 53.7% of all U.S. suicides in 2003.^[165]
   According to Kleck, most research has found no relationship between gun
   availability and suicide rates.^[166]

Federal and state laws[edit]

   The number of federal and state gun laws is unknown. A 2005 American
   Journal of Preventive Medicine study says 300,^[167] and the NRA says
   20,000, though the Washington Post fact checker says of that
   decades-old figure: "This 20,000 figure appears to be an ancient
   guesstimate that has hardened over the decades into a constantly
   repeated, never-questioned talking point. It could be lower, or higher,
   depending on who’s counting what."^[168]

Federal laws[edit]

   Main article: Gun law in the United States

   Federal gun laws are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
   Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Most federal gun laws were enacted
   through:^[169]^[170]
     * National Firearms Act (1934)
     * Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (1968)
     * Gun Control Act of 1968 (1968)
     * Firearm Owners Protection Act (1986)
     * Undetectable Firearms Act (1988)
     * Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (1990) (ruled unconstitutional as
       originally written; has been upheld repeatedly after minor edits
       were made by Congress)
     * Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993)
     * Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994) (expired 2004)

State laws and constitutions[edit]

   Main article: Gun laws in the United States by state
   Mall of America sign giving notice that state law allows private
   establishments to prohibit guns on the premises.

   In addition to federal gun laws, all U.S. states and some local
   jurisdictions have imposed their own firearms restrictions. Each of the
   fifty states has its own laws regarding guns.For example, Hawaii's
   constitution simply copies the text of the Second Amendment
   verbatim,^[171] while North Carolina and South Carolina begin with the
   same but continue with an injunction against maintaining standing
   armies.^[172]^[173] Alaska also begins with the full text of the Second
   Amendment, but adds that the right "shall not be denied or infringed by
   the State or a political subdivision of the State".^[174] Rhode Island,
   subtracts the first half of the Second Amendment, leaving only, "[t]he
   right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
   infringed".^[175]

   The majority of the remaining states' constitutions differ from the
   text of the U.S. Constitution primarily in their clarification of
   exactly to whom the right belongs or by the inclusion of additional,
   specific protections or restrictions. Seventeen states refer to the
   right to keep and bear arms as being an individual right, with Utah and
   Alaska referring to it explicitly as "[t]he individual right to keep
   and bear arms",^[174]^[176] while the other fifteen refer to the right
   as belonging to "every citizen",^[177] "all individuals",^[178] "all
   persons",^[179] or another, very similar phrase.^[nb 1] In contrast are
   four states which make no mention whatever of an individual right or of
   defense of one's self as a valid basis for the right to arms. Arkansas,
   Massachusetts, and Tennessee all state that the right is "for the
   common defense",^[192]^[193]^[194] while Virginia's constitution
   explicitly indicates that the right is derived from the need for a
   militia to defend the state.^[195]

   Most state constitutions enumerate one or more reasons for the keeping
   of arms. Twenty-four states include self-defense as a valid, protected
   use of arms;^[nb 2] twenty-eight cite defense of the state as a proper
   purpose.^[nb 3] Ten states extend the right to defense of home and/or
   property,^[nb 4] five include the defense of family,^[nb 5] and six add
   hunting and recreation.^[nb 6] Idaho is uniquely specific in its
   provision that "[n]o law shall impose licensure, registration, or
   special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or
   ammunition. Nor shall any law permit the confiscation of firearms,
   except those actually used in the commission of a felony".^[196]
   Fifteen state constitutions include specific restrictions on the right
   to keep and bear arms. Florida's constitution calls for a three-day
   waiting period for all modern cartridge handgun purchases, with
   exceptions for handgun purchases by those holding a CCW license, or for
   anyone who purchases a black-powder handgun.^[197] Illinois prefaces
   the right by indicating that it is "[s]ubject...to the police
   power".^[187] Florida and the remaining thirteen states with specific
   restrictions all carry a provision to the effect that the state
   legislature may enact laws regulating the carrying, concealing, and/or
   wearing of arms.^[nb 7]
