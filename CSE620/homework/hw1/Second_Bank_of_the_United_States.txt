   The Second Bank of the United States, located in Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania, was the second federally authorized Hamiltonian National
   Bank^[3] in the United States during its 20-year charter from February
   1816^[4] to January 1836.^[5]

   A private corporation with public duties, the bank handled all fiscal
   transactions for the US Government, and was accountable to Congress and
   the US Treasury. Twenty percent of its capital was owned by the federal
   government, the Bank's single largest stockholder^[6]^[7] Four thousand
   private investors held 80% of the Bank's capital, including one
   thousand Europeans. The bulk of the stocks were held by a few hundred
   wealthy Americans.^[8] In its time, the institution was the largest
   monied corporation in the world.^[9]

   The essential function of the Bank was to regulate the public credit
   issued by private banking institutions through the fiscal duties it
   performed for the US Treasury, and to establish a sound and stable
   national currency.^[10]^[11] The federal deposits endowed the BUS with
   its regulatory capacity.^[5]^[12]

   Modeled on Alexander Hamilton's First Bank of the United States,^[13]
   the Second Bank was chartered by President James Madison in 1816 and
   began operations at its main branch in Philadelphia on January 7,
   1817,^[14]^[15] managing twenty-five branch offices nationwide by
   1832.^[16]

   The efforts to renew the Bank's charter put the institution at the
   center of the general election of 1832, in which the Bank's president
   Nicholas Biddle and pro-Bank National Republicans led by Henry Clay
   clashed with the "hard-money"^[17]^[18] Andrew Jackson administration
   and eastern banking interests in the Bank War.^[19]^[20] Failing to
   secure recharter, the Second Bank of the United States became a private
   corporation in 1836,^[5]^[21] and underwent liquidation in 1838.^[22]

History[edit]

   The political support for the revival of a national banking system was
   rooted in the early 19th century transformation of the country from
   simple Jeffersonian agrarianism towards one interdependent with
   industrialization and finance.^[23]^[24]^[25] In the aftermath of the
   War of 1812 the federal government suffered from the disarray of an
   unregulated currency and a lack of fiscal order; business interests
   sought security for their government bonds.^[26] A national alliance
   arose to legislate a central bank to address these needs.^[27]^[28]

   The political climate^[27] – dubbed the Era of Good Feelings^[29] –
   favored the development of national programs and institutions,
   including a protective tariff, internal improvements and the revival of
   a Bank of the United States^[13]^[25]^[30] Southern and western support
   for the Bank, led by Republican nationalists John C. Calhoun of South
   Carolina and Henry Clay of Kentucky was decisive in the successful
   chartering effort.^[31] The charter was signed into law by Madison on
   April 10, 1816.^[32] Subsequent efforts by Calhoun and Clay to earmark
   the bank's $1.5 million establishment "bonus", and annual dividends
   estimated at $650,000, as a fund for internal improvements, was vetoed
   by President James Madison, on strict constructionist grounds.^[33]

   attorney and the director of the Boston branch.

   December 15, 1840, for the amount of $1,000.

   Opposition to the Bank's revival emanated from two interests. Old
   Republicans, represented by John Taylor of Caroline and John Randolph
   of Roanoke^[34] characterized the Second Bank of the United States as
   both constitutionally illegitimate and a direct threat to Jeffersonian
   agrarianism, state sovereignty and the institution of slavery,
   expressed by Taylor's statement that "...if Congress could incorporate
   a bank, it might emancipate a slave".^[35]^[36]^[37]^[38] Hostile to
   the regulatory effects of the central bank,^[39] private banks –
   proliferating with or without state charters^[40] – had scuttled
   rechartering of the first BUS in 1811.^[41]^[42] These interests played
   significant roles in undermining the institution during the
   administration of US President Andrew Jackson (1829–1837).^[43]

   The BUS was launched in the midst of a major global market readjustment
   as Europe recovered from the Napoleonic Wars^[44] The central bank was
   charged with restraining uninhibited private bank note issue – already
   in progress^[44]^[45] – that threatened to create a credit bubble and
   the risks of a financial collapse. Government land sales in the West,
   fueled by European demand for agricultural products, ensured that a
   speculative bubble would form.^[46] Simultaneously, the national bank
   was engaged in promoting a democratized expansion of credit to
   accommodate laissez-faire impulses among eastern business entrepreneurs
   and credit hungry western and southern farmers^[47]^[48]

   Under the management of the first BUS president William Jones, the Bank
   failed to control paper money issued from its branch banks in the West
   and South, contributing to the post-war speculative land
   boom.^[49]^[50] When the US markets collapsed in the Panic of 1819 – a
   result of global economic adjustments^[51]^[52] – the central bank came
   under withering criticism for its belated tight money policies –
   policies that exacerbated mass unemployment and plunging property
   values.^[53] Further, it transpired that branch directors for the
   Baltimore office had engaged in fraud and larceny^[54]

   Resigning in January 1819^[55] Jones was replaced by Langdon Cheves,
   who continued the contraction in credit in an effort to stop inflation
   and stabilize the Bank, even as the economy began to correct. The
   central bank's reaction to the crisis – a clumsy expansion, then a
   sharp contraction of credit – indicated its weakness, not its
   strength.^[56] The effects were catastrophic, resulting in a protracted
   recession with mass unemployment and a sharp drop in property values
   that persisted until 1822.^[53]^[57] The financial crisis raised doubts
   among the American public as to the efficacy of paper money, and in
   whose interests a national system of finance operated.^[58] Upon this
   widespread disaffection the anti-Bank Jacksonian Democrats would
   mobilize opposition to the BUS in the 1830s.^[58] The national bank was
   in general disrepute among most Americans when Nicholas Biddle, the
   third and last president of the Bank, was appointed by President James
   Monroe in 1823.^[59]

   Under Biddle's guidance, the BUS evolved into a powerful banking
   institution that produced a strong and sound system of national credit
   and currency.^[60] From 1823 to 1833, Biddle expanded credit steadily,
   but with restraint, in a manner that served the needs of the expanding
   American economy.^[61] In 1831, Albert Gallatin former Secretary of the
   Treasury under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison wrote that the BUS
   was fulfilling its charter expectations.^[62]

   By the time of Jackson's inauguration in 1829, the national bank
   appeared to be on solid footing. The US Supreme Court had affirmed the
   constitutionality of the Bank under McCulloch v. Maryland, the 1819
   case which Daniel Webster had argued successfully on its behalf a
   decade earlier,^[63] the US Treasury recognized the useful services it
   provided, and the American currency was healthy and stable.^[64] Public
   perceptions of the central bank were generally positive.^[65]^[66] The
   Bank first came under attack by the Jackson administration in December
   1829, on the grounds that it had failed to produce a stable national
   currency, and that it lacked constitutional legitimacy.^[67]^[68]^[69]
   Both houses of Congress responded with committee investigations and
   reports affirming the historical precedents for the Bank's
   constitutionality and its pivotal role in furnishing a uniform
   currency.^[70] Jackson rejected these findings, and privately
   characterized the Bank as a corrupt institution, dangerous to American
   liberties.^[71]

   his "Order for the Removal," to the approval of the Uncle Sam like
   figure to the right, and the annoyance of the bank's president, shown
   as the Devil himself. Numerous politicians and editors who were given
   favorable loans from the bank run for cover as the financial temple
   crashes down.

   Biddle made repeated overtures to Jackson and his cabinet to secure a
   compromise on the Bank's rechartering (its term due to expire in 1836)
   without success.^[72]^[73] Jackson and the anti-Bank forces persisted
   in their condemnation of the BUS,^[67]^[74] provoking an early
   recharter campaign by pro-Bank National Republicans under Henry
   Clay.^[75]^[76] Clay's political ultimatum to Jackson^[77] – with
   Biddle's financial and political support^[78]^[79] – sparked the Bank
   War^[80]^[81] and placed the fate of the BUS at center of the 1832
   presidential election.^[82]

   Jackson mobilized his political base^[83] by vetoing the recharter
   bill^[84] and – the veto sustained^[85] – easily won reelection on his
   anti-Bank platform.^[86] Jackson proceeded to destroy the Bank as a
   financial and political force by removing its federal
   deposits,^[87]^[88]^[89] and in 1833, federal revenue was diverted into
   selected private banks by executive order, ending the regulatory role
   of the Second Bank of the United States.^[5]

   In hopes of extorting a rescue of the Bank, Biddle induced a
   short-lived financial crisis^[59]^[90] that was initially blamed on
   Jackson's executive action.^[91]^[92] By 1834, a general backlash
   against Biddle's tactics developed, ending the panic^[93]^[94] and all
   recharter efforts were abandoned.^[21]

   In February 1836, the Bank became a private corporation under
   Pennsylvania commonwealth law.^[5] It suspended payment in 1839 and was
   liquidated in 1841.^[22]

Terms of charter[edit]

   The Second Bank of the United States was America's central bank,
   comparable to the Bank of England and the Bank of France, with one key
   distinction – the United States government owned one-fifth (20%) of its
   capital. Whereas other central banks of that era were wholly private,
   the BUS was more characteristic of a government bank.^[95]

   Under its charter, the Bank had a capital limit of $35 million,
   $7.5 million of which represented the government-owned share. The
   central bank was required to remit a "bonus" payment of $1.5 million,
   payable in three installments,^[7] to the government for the privilege
   of using the public funds, interest free, in its private banking
   ventures.^[96] The institution was answerable for its performance to
   the US Treasury and Congress^[97] and subject to Treasury Department
   inspection.^[7]

   As exclusive fiscal agent for the federal government,^[98] it provided
   a number of services as part of its charter including: holding and
   transfer of all US deposits, payment and receipt of all government
   transactions, and processing of tax payments.^[99] In other words, the
   BUS was "the depository of the federal government, which was its
   principal stockholder and customer".^[100]

   The chief personnel for the Bank comprised twenty-five directors, five
   of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, subject
   to Senate approval.^[7] Federally appointed directors were barred from
   acting as officials in other banks. Two of the three BUS presidents,
   William Jones and Nicholas Biddle, were chosen from among these
   government directors.^[97]

   Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Bank was authorized to
   establish branch offices where it deemed suitable and these were immune
   from state taxation.^[7]

BUS regulatory mechanisms[edit]

   The primary regulatory task of the Second Bank of the United States, as
   chartered by Congress in 1816, was to restrain the uninhibited
   proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private
   lenders,^[39] which was highly profitable to these institutions.^[101]

   In this capacity, the Bank would preside over this democratization of
   credit,^[14]^[102] contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement
   of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs,
   encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion.^[14]

   Historian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the Bank
   exerted its anti-inflationary influence:

     Receiving the checks and notes of local banks deposited with the
     [BUS] by government collectors of revenue, the [BUS] had constantly
     to come back on the local banks for settlements of the amounts which
     the checks and notes called for. It had to do so because it made
     those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever
     desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e.
     silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically
     regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent
     the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger
     the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced
     their power to lend.^[103]

   Under this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with
   the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or
   at least mitigated.^[104] It was just this mechanism that the local
   private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending
   strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government,
   requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet
   their debt obligations to the US Treasury.^[39] The proliferation of
   banking institutions – from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837^[105] –
   meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector
   during the Jackson administration.^[14]

Architecture[edit]

   The architect of the Second Bank of the United States was William
   Strickland (1788–1854), a former student of Benjamin Latrobe
   (1764–1820), the man who is often called the first
   professionally-trained American architect. Latrobe and Strickland were
   both disciples of the Greek Revival style. Strickland would go on to
   design many other American public buildings in this style, including
   financial structures such as the New Orleans, Dahlonega, Mechanics
   National Bank (also in Philadelphia) and Charlotte branch mints in the
   mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main U.S.
   Mint in Philadelphia in 1833.

   Strickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States remains
   fairly straightforward. The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be
   seen immediately in the north and south façades, which use a large set
   of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the stylobate.
   On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe Doric columns, which
   are crowned by an entablature containing a triglyph frieze and simple
   triangular pediment. The building appears much as an ancient Greek
   temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance
   hallway in the center of the north façade flanked by two rooms on
   either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the
   other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and
   west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan
   window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which,
   due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate from
   the exposure to the elements of weak parts of the stone.^[106] This
   phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south façade.
   Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.

   The Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the
   earlier, Federal style in architecture used for the First Bank of the
   United States, which also still stands and is located nearby in
   Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal
   structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its façade, which is
   also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of
   sash windows piercing the two stories of the façade. The roofline is
   also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the
   pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa
   than a Greek temple.

Current building use[edit]

   Since the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety
   of functions. As of 2006, it is included as one of the main structures
   in Independence National Historical Park in downtown Philadelphia,
   alongside many other important early American structures such as
   Independence Hall and the Philadelphia Merchants' Exchange.

   The structure is open daily free of charge and serves as an art
   gallery, housing a large and famous collection of portraits of
   prominent early Americans painted by Charles Willson Peale and many
   others.
