   Page one of the original copy of the United States Constitution

   The United States Constitution was written in 1787 during the
   Philadelphia Convention. The old Congress set the rules the new
   government followed in terms of writing and ratifying the new
   constitution. After ratification in eleven states, in 1789 its elected
   officers of government assembled in New York City, replacing the
   Articles of Confederation government. The original Constitution has
   been amended twenty-seven times. The meaning of the Constitution is
   interpreted and extended by judicial review in the federal courts. The
   original parchment copies are on display at the National Archives
   Building.

   Two alternative plans were developed in Convention. The nationalist
   majority, soon to be called "Federalists," put forth the Virginia Plan,
   a consolidated government based on proportional representation among
   the states by population. The "old patriots," later called
   "Anti-Federalists," advocated the New Jersey Plan, a purely federal
   proposal, based on providing each state with equal representation. The
   Connecticut Compromise allowed for both plans to work together. Other
   controversies developed regarding slavery and a Bill of Rights in the
   original document.

   The drafted Constitution was submitted to the Confederation Congress.
   It in turn forwarded the Constitution as drafted to the states for
   ratification by the Constitutional method proposed. The Federalist
   Papers provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some
   states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that
   were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the
   new government, and they were duly proposed in the first session of the
   First Congress.

   Once the Articles Congress certified that eleven states had ratified
   the Constitution, elections were held, the new government began on
   March 4, 1789, and the Articles Congress dissolved itself. Later
   Amendments address individual liberties and freedoms, federal
   relationships, election procedures, terms of office, expanding the
   electorate, ending slavery, financing government, consumption of
   alcohol and Congressional pay. Criticism over the life of the
   Constitution has centered on expanding democracy and states rights.

Declaration of Independence[edit]

   Main article: United States Declaration of Independence

   On June 4, 1776, a resolution was introduced in the Second Continental
   Congress declaring the union with Great Britain to be dissolved,
   proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the
   drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective
   states. Independence was declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a
   plan of confederation was postponed. Although the Declaration was a
   statement of principles, it did not create a government or even a
   framework for how politics would be carried out. It was the Articles of
   Confederation that provided the necessary structure to the new nation
   during and after the American Revolution. The Declaration, however, did
   set forth the ideas of natural rights and the social contract that
   would help form the foundation of constitutional government.

   The era of the Declaration of Independence is sometimes called the
   "Continental Congress" period. John Adams famously estimated as many as
   one-third of those resident in the original thirteen colonies were
   patriots. Scholars such as Gordon Wood describe how Americans were
   caught up in the Revolutionary fervor and excitement of creating
   governments, societies, a new nation on the face of the earth by
   rational choice as Thomas Paine declared in Common Sense.

   Republican government and personal liberty for "the people" were to
   overspread the New World continents and to last forever, a gift to
   posterity. Most of these were influenced by Enlightenment philosophy.
   The adherents to this cause seized on English Whig political philosophy
   as described by historian Forrest McDonald as justification for most of
   their changes to received colonial charters and traditions. It was
   rooted in opposition to monarchy they saw as venal and corrupting to
   the "permanent interests of the people."

   To these partisans, voting was the only permanent defense of the
   people. Elected terms for legislature were cut to one year, for
   Virginia's Governor, one year without re-election. Property
   requirements for suffrage for men were reduced to taxes on their tools
   in some states. Free blacks in New York could vote if they owned enough
   property. New Hampshire was thinking of abolishing all voting
   requirements for men but residency and religion. New Jersey let women
   vote. In some states, senators were now elected by the same voters as
   the larger electorate for the House, and even judges were elected to
   one-year terms.

   These "radical Whigs" were called the people "out-of-doors." They
   distrusted not only royal authority, but any small, secretive group as
   being unrepublican. Crowds of men and women massed at the steps of
   rural Court Houses during market-militia-court days. Shays Rebellion is
   a famous example. Urban riots began by the out-of-doors rallies on the
   steps of an oppressive government official with speakers such as
   members of the Sons of Liberty holding forth in the "people's
   "committees" until some action was decided upon, including hanging his
   effigy outside a bedroom window, or looting and burning down the
   offending tyrant's home.

Revolutionary Congress[edit]

   The government of the First and Second Continental Congress, the period
   from September 1774 to March 1, 1781 is referred to as the
   Revolutionary Congress. Beginning in 1777, the substantial powers
   assumed by Congress “made the league of states as cohesive and strong
   as any similar sort of republican confederation in history.”^[1] The
   process created the United States "by the people in collectivity,
   rather than by the individual states.” because only four had state
   constitutions at the time of the Declaration of Independence founding
   the nation, and three of those were provisional. Prior to the Articles
   of Confederation, and the Articles Congress, the Supreme Court in Ware
   v. Hylton and again in Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators, perceived
   Congress as exercising powers derived from the people, expressly
   conferred through the medium of state conventions or legislatures, and,
   once exercised, "impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience
   of the people.”^[2]

Articles of Confederation[edit]

   Main article: Articles of Confederation

   The Articles of Confederation was unanimously adopted in 1781 once
   Maryland agreed. Over the previous four years, it had been used by
   Congress as a "working document" to administer the early United States
   government, win the Revolutionary War and secure the Treaty of Paris
   (1783) with Great Britain. Lasting successes during its life prior to
   the Constitutional Convention included the Land Ordinance of 1785
   whereby Congress promised settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains
   full citizenship and eventual statehood.^[3] Some historians
   characterize this period from 1781 to 1789 as weakness, dissension, and
   turmoil.^[4] Other scholars view the evidence as reflecting an
   underlying stability and prosperity.^[5] But signs of returning
   prosperity in some areas did not slow growing domestic and foreign
   problems. Nationalists saw that the confederation's central government
   was not strong enough to establish a sound financial system, regulate
   trade, enforce treaties, or go to war when needed.^[6]

   The Congress was the sole organ of the national government, without a
   national court to interpret law nor an executive branch to enforce
   them, in the states or on individuals. Governmental functions,
   including declarations of war and calls for an army, were supported in
   some degree for some time, by each state voluntarily, or not .^[6]
   These newly independent states separated from Britain no longer
   received favored treatment at British ports. The British refused to
   negotiate a commercial treaty in 1785 because the individual American
   states would not be bound by it. Congress could not act directly upon
   the States nor upon individuals. It had no authority to regulate
   foreign or interstate commerce. Every act of government was left to the
   individual States. Each state levied taxes and tariffs on other states
   at will, which invited retaliation. Congress could vote itself mediator
   and judge in state disputes, but states did not have to accept its
   decisions.^[6]

   The weak central government could not back its policies with military
   strength, embarrassing it in foreign affairs. The British refused to
   withdraw their troops from the forts and trading posts in the new
   nation's Northwest Territory, as they had agreed to do in the Treaty of
   Paris of 1783. British officers on the northern boundaries and Spanish
   officers to the south supplied arms to Native American tribes, allowing
   them to attack American settlers. The Spanish refused to allow western
   American farmers to use their port of New Orleans to ship produce.^[6]

   Revenues were requisitioned by Congressional petition to each state.
   None paid what they were asked. Some funded only enough to pay interest
   to their own citizens. Connecticut declared it would not pay at all,
   not just for one year, but two. Congress appealed to the thirteen
   states for an amendment to the Articles to tax enough to pay the public
   debt as principle came due. Twelve states agreed, Rhode Island did not,
   so it failed.^[7] The Articles required super majorities. Amendment
   proposals to states required ratification by all thirteen states, all
   important legislation needed 70% approval, at least nine states.
   Repeatedly, one or two states defeated legislative proposals of major
   importance.^[6]

   Without taxes the government could not pay its debt. Seven of the
   thirteen states printed large quantities of its own paper money, backed
   by gold, land, or nothing, so there was no fair exchange rate among
   them. State courts required state creditors to accept payments at face
   value with a fraction of real purchase power. The same legislation that
   these states used to wipe out the Revolutionary debt to patriots was
   used to pay off promised veteran pensions. The measures were popular
   because they helped both small farmers and plantation owners pay off
   their debts.^[8]

   The Massachusetts legislature was one of the five against paper money.
   It imposed a tightly limited currency and high taxes. Without paper
   money veterans without cash lost their farms at sheriff's auction for
   back taxes. This triggered Shays Rebellion to stop tax collectors and
   close the courts until the proceedings were dropped. Troops quickly
   suppressed the rebellion, but nationalists like George Washington
   warned, "There are combustibles in every state which a spark might set
   fire to." ^[9]

Steps to a convention[edit]

Mount Vernon Conference[edit]

   Main article: Mount Vernon Conference

   Movement towards replacing the Articles of Confederation began the year
   after its formal adoption in June 1784. George Washington, the future
   president of the Convention, hosted Virginia and Maryland commissioners
   to negotiate joint commercial regulation of the Potomac River.^[a] The
   compact drafted by the Mount Vernon Commission is still in force, but
   more importantly, they suggested a convention of states to
   "effectually" provide for a uniform commercial system throughout the
   United States.^[b]

   This meant overcoming tariffs that the states had erected against one
   another during the Articles of Confederation regime. It was an idea for
   free trade across political boundaries like that advocated by Adam
   Smith in his influential 1776 Wealth of Nations. Over the next few
   months in state legislatures and in the Articles Congress, their
   recommendation was taken up and enlarged concerning individual rights,
   congressional governance and national security.^[10] The Constitution
   was to establish the largest free trade area in the world.

Grand Committee[edit]

   The Articles Congress received a "Grand Committee" report on August 7,
   1786 proposing seven amendments to the states for power to "render the
   federal government adequate" to its declared purposes. As each achieved
   unanimous approval, it was to be adopted into the Articles of
   Confederation. But it did not leave Congress.

   Congress was to have "sole and exclusive" power to regulate trade.
   States could not favor foreigners over citizens. Tax bills would
   require 70% vote, public debt 85%, not 100%. Congress could charge
   states a late payment penalty fee. A state withholding troops would be
   charged for them, plus a penalty. If a state did not pay, Congress
   could collect directly from its cities and counties. A state payment on
   another's requisition would earn annual 6%. There would have been a
   national court of seven. No-shows at Congress would have been banned
   from any U.S. or state office.^[11] A week later, three states were
   asked again to explain why they did not pay their national taxes. Eight
   were "earnestly recommended" to comply with a financial Act of
   Congress. The "Grand Committee" proposals for seven amendments to the
   Articles of Confederation were sent back to committee without a
   vote.^[12]

Annapolis Convention[edit]

   Main article: Annapolis Convention (1786)

   Nine of the thirteen United States appointed commissioners to meet at
   Annapolis in September 1786. They were to formulate recommendations for
   improvements in the international trade and interstate commerce that
   was faltering under the regime of the Articles of Confederation. In the
   event, only five States were represented, Virginia, Pennsylvania,
   Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Although centrally located, even
   appointed delegates from New England and Southern states did not show.
   Because few states participated, the Annapolis Convention did not deem
   "it advisable to proceed on the business of their mission." Leaders
   including Virginians Edmund Randolph and James Madison wrote a
   unanimous report suggesting that a convention of delegates from all
   thirteen states meet at Philadelphia in May 1787. More than trade and
   commerce, their purpose would be to examine the defects of the Articles
   of Confederation government and to formulate "a plan for supplying such
   defects as may be discovered."^[13]

   Virginia and five other states immediately approved and appointed their
   delegations. New York and others hesitated thinking that only the
   Continental Congress could propose amendments to the Articles of
   Confederation. George Washington was quite unwilling to attend an
   irregular convention called in the same way as the failed Annapolis
   Convention. Congress then called the convention at Philadelphia. The
   "Federal Constitution" was to be changed to meet the requirements of
   good government and "the preservation of the Union". Congress would
   then approve what measures it allowed, then the state legislatures
   would unanimously confirm whatever changes of those were to take
   effect.

Constitutional Convention[edit]

   See also: Constitutional Convention (United States)

                 Independence Hall, south wing. Philadelphia

                     Washington as Convention President

   Twelve state legislatures, Rhode Island being the only exception, sent
   delegates to convene at Philadelphia in May 1787.^[14] While the
   resolution calling the Convention specified that its purpose was to
   propose amendments to the Articles, through discussion and debate it
   became clear by mid-June that the Convention would propose a
   Constitution with a fundamentally new design.^[15]

Sessions[edit]

   The Congress of the Confederation endorsed a plan to revise the
   Articles of Confederation on February 21, 1787.^[14] It called on each
   state legislature to send delegates to a convention "'for the sole and
   express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation' in ways
   that, when approved by Congress and the states, would 'render the
   federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the
   preservation of the Union.'"^[16]

   To amend the Articles into a workable government, 74 delegates from the
   twelve states were named by their state legislatures; 55 showed up, and
   39 eventually signed.^[17] On May 3, eleven days early, James Madison
   arrived to Philadelphia and met with James Wilson of the Pennsylvania
   delegation to plan strategy. Madison outlined his plan in letters that
   (1) State legislatures each send delegates, not the Articles Congress.
   (2) Convention reaches agreement with signatures from every state. (3)
   The Articles Congress approves forwarding it to the state legislatures.
   (4) The state legislatures independently call one-time conventions to
   ratify, selecting delegates by each state's various rules of suffrage.
   The Convention was to be "merely advisory" to the people voting in each
   state.^[c]

Convening[edit]

   George Washington arrived on time, Sunday, the day before scheduled
   opening.^[d] For the entire duration of the Convention, Washington was
   a guest at the home of Robert Morris, Congress' financier for the
   American Revolution and a Pennsylvania delegate. William Jackson, in
   two years to be the president of the Society of the Cincinnati, had
   been Morris' agent in England for a time. He won election as a
   non-delegate to be the Convention Secretary. Morris entertained among
   the delegates lavishly.

                            'Committee of the Whole'

   The convention was scheduled to open May 14, but only Pennsylvania and
   Virginia delegations were present. The Convention was postponed until a
   quorum of seven states gathered on Friday the 25th.^[e] George
   Washington was elected the Convention president, and Chancellor (judge)
   George Wythe (Va) was chosen Chair of the Rules Committee. The rules of
   the Convention were published the following Monday.^[f]

   Nathaniel Gorham (Ma) was elected Chair of the "Committee of the
   Whole"". These were the same delegates in the same room, but they could
   use informal rules for the interconnected provisions in the draft
   articles to be made, remade and reconnected as the order of business
   proceeded. The Convention officials and adopted procedures were in
   place before the arrival of nationalist opponents such as John Lansing
   (NY) and Luther Martin (MD).^[g] By the end of May, the stage was set.

   The Constitutional Convention voted to keep the debates secret so that
   the delegates could speak freely, negotiate, bargain, compromise and
   change. Yet the proposed Constitution as reported from the Convention
   was an "innovation", the most dismissive epithet a politician could use
   to condemn any new proposal. It promised a fundamental change from the
   old confederation into a new, consolidated yet federal government. The
   accepted secrecy of usual affairs conducted in regular order did not
   apply. It became a major issue in the very public debates leading up to
   the crowd-filled ratification conventions.^[h]

   Despite the public outcry against secrecy among its critics, the
   delegates continued in positions of public trust. State legislatures
   chose ten Convention delegates of their 33 total for the Articles
   Congress that September.^[24]

   Outside the Convention in Philadelphia, there was a national convening
   of the Society of the Cincinnati. Washington was said to be
   embarrassed. The 1776 "old republican" delegates like Elbridge Gerry
   (MA) found anything military or hereditary anathema. The Presbyterian
   Synod of Philadelphia and New York convention was meeting to redefine
   its Confession, dropping the faith requirement for civil authority to
   prohibit false worship.^[25] Protestant Episcopalian Washington
   attended a Roman Catholic Mass and dinner.^[26] Revolution veteran
   Jonas Phillips, of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue, petitioned the
   Convention to avoid a national oath including belief in both Old and
   New Testaments. Merchants of Providence, Rhode Island, petitioned for
   consideration, even though their Assembly had not sent a
   delegation.^[27]

   Manasseh Cutler came directly from the U.S. Capital in New York and
   found himself a frequent dinner guest among the delegates. He carried
   grants of five million acres to parcel out among The Ohio Company and
   "speculators", some of whom would be found among those attending the
   Convention.^[i] A Philadelphia guest of Robert Morris, Noah Webster
   would write a pamphlet as "A Citizen of America" immediately after the
   signing. "Leading Principles of the Federal Convention" advocated
   adoption of the Constitution. It was published much earlier and more
   widely circulated than today's better known Federalist Papers.^[29]

Agenda[edit]

   Every few days, new delegates arrived, happily noted in Madison's
   Journal. But as the Convention went on, individual delegate coming and
   going meant that a state's vote could change with the change of
   delegation composition. The volatility added to the inherent
   difficulties, making for an "ever-present danger that the Convention
   might dissolve and the entire project be abandoned."^[30]

                           "unsung hero of Convention"

   Although twelve states sent delegations, there were never more than
   eleven represented in the floor debates, often fewer. State delegations
   absented themselves at votes different times of day. There was no
   minimum for a state delegation; one would do. Daily sessions would have
   thirty members present. Members came and went on public and personal
   business. The Articles Congress was meeting at the same time, so
   members would absent themselves to New York City on Congressional
   business for days and weeks at a time.^[31]

   But the work before them was continuous, even if attendance was not.
   The Convention resolved itself into a "Committee of the Whole", and
   could remain so for days. It was informal, votes could be taken and
   retaken easily, positions could change without prejudice, and
   importantly, no formal quorum call was required. The nationalists were
   resolute. As Madison put it, the situation was too serious for
   despair.^[32] They used the same State House, later named Independence
   Hall, as the Declaration signers. The building setback from the street
   was still dignified, but the "shaky" steeple was gone.^[33] When they
   adjourned each day, they lived in nearby lodgings, as guests, roomers
   or renters. They ate supper with one another in town and taverns,
   "often enough in preparation for tomorrow's meeting."^[34]

   Delegates reporting to the Convention presented their credentials to
   the Secretary, Major William Jackson of South Carolina. The state
   legislatures of the day used these occasions to say why they were
   sending representatives abroad. New York thus publically enjoined its
   members to pursue all possible "alterations and provisions" for good
   government and "preservation of the Union". New Hampshire called for
   "timely measures to enlarge the powers of Congress". Virginia stressed
   the "necessity of extending the revision of the federal system to all
   its defects".^[30]

   On the other hand, Delaware categorically forbade any alteration of the
   Articles one-state, equal vote, one-vote-only provision in the Articles
   Congress.^[35] The Convention would have a great deal of work to do to
   reconcile the many expectations in the chamber. At the same time,
   delegates wanted to finish their work by fall harvest and its
   commerce.^[36]

   May 29, Edmund Randolph (VA) proposed the Virginia Plan that would
   serve as the unofficial agenda for the Convention. It was weighted
   toward the interests of the larger, more populous states. The intent
   was to meet the purposes set out in the Articles of Confederation,
   "common defense, security of liberty and general welfare". The Virginia
   Plan was national, authority flowed from the people. If the people will
   ratify them, changes for better republican government and national
   union should be proposed.

   Much of the Virginia Plan was adopted.^[j] All the powers in the
   Articles transfer to the new government. Congress has two houses, the
   'house' apportioned by population. It can enact laws affecting more
   than one state and Congress can override a veto. The President can
   enforce the law. The Supreme Court and inferior courts rule on
   international, U.S. and state law. The Constitution is the supreme law
   and all state officers swear to uphold the Constitution. Every state is
   a republic, and new states can be admitted.^[38] The Articles Congress
   continued until the new system started. Amendments are possible without
   Congress. The Convention recommendations went to Congress, from them to
   the states. State legislatures set the election rules for ratification
   conventions, and the people "expressly" chose representatives to
   consider and decide about the Constitution.^[37]

   June 15, William Patterson (NJ) proposed the Convention minority's New
   Jersey Plan. It was weighted toward the interests of the smaller, less
   populous states. The intent was to preserve the states from a plan to
   "destroy or annihilate" them. The New Jersey Plan was purely federal,
   authority flowed from the states. Gradual change should come from the
   states. If the Articles could not be amended, then advocates argued
   that should be the report from the Convention to the states.^[39]

   Although the New Jersey Plan only survived three days as an alternate
   proposal, substantial elements of it were adopted.^[k] The articles
   were "revised, corrected and enlarged" for good government and
   preservation of the Union. The Senate is elected by the states, at
   first by the state legislatures. Congress passes acts for revenue
   collected directly in the states, and the rulings of state courts are
   reviewed by the Supreme Court.^[41] State apportionment for taxes
   failed, but the 'house' is apportioned by the population count of free
   inhabitants and three-fifths of others originally. States can be added
   to the Union. Presidents appoint federal judges. Treaties entered into
   by Congress are the supreme law of the land. All state judiciaries are
   bound to enforce treaties, state laws notwithstanding. The President
   can raise an army to enforce treaties in any state. States treat a
   violation of law in another state as though it happened there.^[41]

   Current knowledge of drafting the Constitution comes primarily from the
   Journal left by James Madison, found chronologically incorporated in
   Max Farrand's "The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787", which
   included the Convention Journal and sources from other Federalists and
   Anti-Federalists.^[42]

   Scholars observe that it is unusual in world history for the minority
   in a revolution to have the influence that the "old patriot"
   Anti-Federalists had over the "nationalist" Federalists who had the
   support of the revolutionary army in the Society of the Cincinnati.
   Both factions were intent on forging a nation in which both could be
   full participants in the changes which were sure to come, since that
   was most likely to allow for their national union, guarantee liberty
   for their posterity, and promote their mutual long-term material
   prosperity.

Slavery in debate[edit]

   Main article: Slavery in the United States

   The contentious issue of slavery was too controversial to be resolved
   during the Convention. But it was at center stage in the Convention
   three times, June 7 regarding who would vote for Congress, June 11 in
   debate over how to proportion relative seating in the 'house', and
   August 22 relating to commerce and the future wealth of the nation.

   Once the Convention looked at how to proportion the House
   representation, tempers among several delegates exploded over slavery.
   When the Convention progressed beyond the personal attacks, it adopted
   the existing "federal ratio" of the Articles Congress for taxing states
   proportionate to their wealth, three-fifths each state slave
   count.^[43]

   On August 6, the Committee of Detail reported its revisions to the
   Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again it was
   met with attacks of outrage. Over the next two weeks, delegates wove a
   web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and
   west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave
   trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but
   only then.^[l] Later generations could try out their own answers. The
   delegates were trying to make a government that might last that
   long.^[44]

   Migration of the free or "importation" of indentures and slaves could
   continue by states, defining slaves as persons, not property. Long-term
   power would change by population as counted every ten years.
   Apportionment in the House would not be by wealth, it would be by
   people, the free citizens and three-fifths the number of other persons
   meaning propertyless slaves and taxed Indian farming families.^[m]

   In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson sent a message to the 9th Congress
   on their constitutional opportunity to remove U.S. citizens from the
   transatlantic slave trade "[violating] human rights".^[45] The 1807
   "Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves" took effect the first instant
   the Constitution allowed, January 1, 1808. The United States joined the
   British Parliament that year in the first "international humanitarian
   campaign".^[46]

   In the 1840-1860 era abolitionists denounced the Fugitive Slave Clause
   and other protections of slavery. William Lloyd Garrison famously
   declared the Constitution "a covenant with death and an agreement with
   Hell."^[47]

   In ratification conventions, the anti-slavery delegates sometimes began
   as anti-ratification votes. Still, the Constitution "as written" was an
   improvement over the Articles from an abolitionist point of view. The
   Constitution provided for abolition of the slave trade but the Articles
   did not. The outcome could be determined gradually over time.^[48]
   Sometimes contradictions among opponents were used to try to gain
   abolitionist converts. In Virginia, Federalist George Nicholas
   dismissed fears on both sides. Objections to the Constitution were
   inconsistent, "At the same moment it is opposed for being promotive and
   destructive of slavery!" ^[49] But the contradiction was never resolved
   peaceably, and the failure to do so contributed to the Civil War.^[50]

"Great Compromise"[edit]

   Main article: Connecticut Compromise

   Roger Sherman (CT), although something of a political broker in
   Connecticut, was an unlikely leader in the august company of the
   Convention.^[n] But on June 11, he proposed the first version of the
   Convention's "Great Compromise". It was like the proposal he made in
   the 1776 Continental Congress. Representation in Congress should be
   both by states and by population. There, he was voted down by the small
   states in favor of all states equal, one vote only.^[52] Now in 1787
   Convention, he wanted to balance all the big-state victories for
   population apportionment. He proposed that in the second 'senate'
   branch of the legislature, each state should be equal, one vote and no
   more.^[o]^[54] The motion for equal state representation in a 'senate'
   failed: 6 against, 5 for.^[55]

                                              "Men of original principles"

       *

                             create regional nations

   After these defeats, the delegates who called themselves the "old
   patriots" of 1776 and the "men of original principles" organized a
   caucus in the Convention. William Paterson (NJ) spoke for them
   introducing his "New Jersey Plan".^[56]^[p] Roger Sherman (CT), a
   signer of the Declaration of Independence, was with them. Supporters
   explained that it "sustained the sovereignty of the states", while the
   Edmund Randolph (VA) "Virginia Plan" erased it. The Convention had no
   authority to propose anything not sent up from state legislatures, and
   the states were not likely to adopt anything new. The "nationalists"
   answered, The Convention could not conclude anything, but it could
   recommend anything.^[58]

   "Patriots" said if their legislature knew anything about proposals for
   consolidated government, it would not have sent anyone. "Nationalists"
   countered, that it would be treason to withhold any proposal for good
   government when the salvation of the American republic was at
   stake.^[58] Three sessions after its introduction, the New Jersey Plan
   failed : 7 against, 3 for, 1 divided.^[59] For nearly a month there was
   no progress; small states were seriously thinking of walking out of the
   Convention.^[q]

   Then June 25, the "original principles" men finally won a vote. The
   'senate' would be chosen by the state legislatures, not the people,
   passed: 9 for, 2 against.^[61] The basis of representation for both the
   'house' and the 'senate' re-surfaced. Sherman tried a second time to
   get his idea for a 'house' on the basis of population and a 'senate' on
   an equal states basis. The "big states" got their population 'house'
   win, then his equal state 'senate' motion was dropped without a vote.
   The majority adjourned "before a determination was taken in the House."
   ^[62] Luther Martin (MD) insisted that he would rather divide the Union
   into regional governments than submit to a consolidated government
   under the Randolph Plan.^[63]

   Sherman's proposal came up again for the third time from Oliver
   Ellsworth (CT). In the "senate", the states should have equal
   representation. Advocates said that if could not be agreed to, the
   union would fall apart somehow.^[64] Big states would not be trusted,
   the small states could confederate with a foreign power showing "more
   good faith". If delegates could not unite behind this here, one day the
   states could be united by "some foreign sword".^[65] On the question of
   equal state representation, the Convention adjourned in the same way
   again, "before a determination was taken in the House.".^[66]

   On July 2, the Convention for the fourth time considered a "senate"
   with equal state votes. This time a vote was taken, but it stalled
   again, tied at 5 yes, 5 no, 1 divided. The Convention elected one
   delegate out of the delegation of each state onto a Committee to make a
   proposal; it reported July 5.^[67] Nothing changed over five days. July
   10, Lansing and Yates (NY) quit the Convention in protest over the big
   state majorities repeatedly overrunning the small state delegations in
   vote after vote.^[68] No direct vote on the basis of 'senate'
   representation was pushed on the floor for another week.

   But the Convention floor leaders kept moving forward where they could.
   First the new 'house' seat apportionment was agreed, balancing big and
   small, north and south. The big states got a decennial census for
   'house' apportionment to reflect their future growth. Northerners had
   insisted on counting only free citizens for the 'house'; southern
   delegations wanted to add property. Benjamin Franklin's compromise was
   that there would be no "property" provision to add representatives, but
   states with large slave populations would get a bonus added to their
   free persons by counting three-fifths other persons.^[69]

   On July 16, Sherman's "Great Compromise" prevailed on its fifth try.
   Every state was to have equal numbers in the United States Senate.^[70]
   Washington ruled it passed on the vote 5 yes, 4 no, 1 divided. It was
   not that five was a majority of twelve, but to keep the business moving
   forward, he used precedent established in the Convention earlier.^[71]
   Now some of the big-state delegates talked of walking out, but none
   did. Debate over the next ten days developed an agreed general outline
   for the Constitution.^[72] Small states readily yielded on many
   questions. Most remaining delegates, big-state and small, now felt safe
   enough to chance a new plan.^[70]

Two new branches[edit]

                                               Ruler as "chief magistrate"

       *

                               John Dickinson, DE
                            for one-person president

   The Constitution innovated two branches of government that were not a
   part of the U.S. government during the Articles of Confederation.
   Previously, a thirteen member committee had been left behind in
   Philadelphia when Congress adjourned to carry out the "executive"
   functions. Suits between states were referred to the Articles Congress,
   and treated as a private bill to be determined by majority vote of
   members attending that day.

   On June 7, the "national executive" was taken up in Convention. The
   "chief magistrate", or 'presidency' was of serious concern for a
   formerly colonial people fearful of concentrated power in one person.
   But to secure a "vigorous executive", nationalist delegates such as
   James Wilson (PA), Charles Pinckney (SC), and John Dickenson (DE)
   favored a single officer. They had someone in mind whom everyone could
   trust to start off the new system, George Washington.

   After introducing the item for discussion, there was a prolonged
   silence. Benjamin Franklin (Pa) and John Rutledge (SC) had urged
   everyone to speak their minds freely. When addressing the issue with
   George Washington in the room, delegates were careful to phrase their
   objections to potential offenses by officers chosen in the future who
   would be 'president' "subsequent" to the start-up. Roger Sherman (CT),
   Edmund Randolph (VA) and Pierce Butler^[r] (SC) all objected,
   preferring two or three persons in the executive, as had the ancient
   Roman Republic.

   Nathaniel Gorham was Chair of the Committee of the Whole, so Washington
   sat in the Virginia delegation where everyone could see how he voted.
   The vote for a one-man 'presidency' carried 7-for, 3-against, New York,
   Delaware and Maryland in the negative. Virginia, along with George
   Washington, had voted yes. As of that vote for a single 'presidency',
   George Mason (VA) gravely announced to the floor, that as of that
   moment, the Confederation's federal government was "in some measure
   dissolved by the meeting of this Convention."^[73]

                                                   First national court(s)

       *

                          district courts = flexibility

   The Convention was following the Randolph Plan for an agenda, taking
   each resolve in turn to move proceedings forward. They returned to
   items when overnight coalitions required adjustment to previous votes
   to secure a majority on the next item of business. June 19, and it was
   Randolph's Ninth Resolve next, about the national court system. On the
   table was the nationalist proposal for the inferior (lower) courts in
   the national judiciary.

   Pure 1776 republicanism had not given much credit to judges, who would
   set themselves up apart from and sometimes contradicting the state
   legislature, the voice of the sovereign people. Under the precedent of
   English Common Law according to William Blackstone, the legislature,
   following proper procedure, was for all constitutional purposes, "the
   people." This dismissal of unelected officers sometimes took an
   unintended turn among the people. One of John Adams clients believed
   the First Continental Congress in 1775 had assumed the sovereignty of
   Parliament, and so abolished all previously established courts in
   Massachusetts.^[74]

   In the Convention, looking at a national system, Judge Wilson (PA)
   sought appointments by a single person to avoid legislative payoffs.
   Judge Rutledge (SC) was against anything but one national court, a
   Supreme Court to receive appeals from the highest state courts, like
   the South Carolina court he presided over as Chancellor. Rufus King
   (MA) thought national district courts in each state would cost less
   than appeals that otherwise would go to the 'supreme court' in the
   national capital. National inferior courts passed but making
   appointments by 'congress' was crossed out and left blank so the
   delegates could take it up later after "maturer reflection."^[74]

Re-allocate power[edit]

   Main article: Federalism in the United States

   The Constitutional Convention created a new, unprecedented form of
   government by reallocating powers of government. Every previous
   national authority had been either a centralized government, or a
   "confederation of sovereign constituent states." The American
   power-sharing was unique at the time. The sources and changes of power
   were up to the states. The foundations of government and extent of
   power came from both national and state sources. But the new government
   would have a national operation.^[75] To meet their goals of cementing
   the Union and securing citizen rights, Framers allocated power among
   executive, senate, house and judiciary of the central government. But
   each state government in their variety continued exercising powers in
   their own sphere.^[76]

Increase Congress[edit]

   The Convention did not start with national powers from scratch, it
   began with the powers already vested in the Articles Congress with
   control of the military, international relations and commerce.^[s] The
   Constitution added ten more. Five were minor relative to power sharing,
   including business and manufacturing protections.^[t] One important new
   power authorized Congress to protect states from the "domestic
   violence" of riot and civil disorder, but it was conditioned by a state
   request.^[79]

   The Constitution increased Congressional power to organize, arm and
   discipline the state militias, to use them to enforce the laws of
   Congress, suppress rebellions within the states and repel invasions.
   But the Second Amendment would ensure that Congressional power could
   not be used to disarm state militias.^[80]^[81]

   Taxation substantially increased the power of Congress relative to the
   states. It was limited by restrictions, forbidding taxes on exports,
   per capita taxes, requiring import duties to be uniform and that taxes
   be applied to paying U.S. debt. But the states were stripped of their
   ability to levy taxes on imports, which was at the time, "by far the
   most bountiful source of tax revenues".

   Congress had no further restrictions relating to political economy. It
   could institute protective tariffs, for instance. Congress overshadowed
   state power regulating interstate commerce; the United States would be
   the "largest area of free trade in the world."^[82] The most undefined
   grant of power was the power to "make laws which shall be necessary and
   proper for carrying into execution" the Constitution's enumerated
   powers.^[80]

Limit governments[edit]

   As of ratification, sovereignty was no longer to be theoretically
   indivisible. With a wide variety of specific powers among different
   branches of national governments and thirteen republican state
   governments, now "each of the portions of powers delegated to the one
   or to the other ... is ... sovereign with regard to its proper
   objects".^[83] There were some powers that remained beyond the reach of
   both national powers and state powers,^[u] so the logical seat of
   American "sovereignty" belonged directly with the people-voters of each
   state.^[84]

   Besides expanding Congressional power, the Constitution limited states
   and central government. Six limits on the national government addressed
   property rights such as slavery and taxes.^[v] Six protected liberty
   such as prohibiting ex post facto laws and no religious tests for
   national offices in any state, even if they had them for state
   offices.^[w] Five were principles of a republic, as in legislative
   appropriation.^[x] These restrictions lacked systematic organization,
   but all constitutional prohibitions were practices that the British
   Parliament had "legitimately taken in the absence of a specific denial
   of the authority."^[85]

   The regulation of state power presented a "qualitatively different"
   undertaking. In the state constitutions, the people did not enumerate
   powers. They gave their representatives every right and authority not
   explicitly reserved to themselves. The Constitution extended the limits
   that the states had previously imposed upon themselves under the
   Articles of Confederation, forbidding taxes on imports and disallowing
   treaties among themselves, for example.^[y]

   In light of the repeated abuses by ex post facto laws passed by the
   state legislatures, 1783–1787, the Constitution prohibited ex post
   facto laws and bills of attainder to protect United States citizen
   property rights and right to a fair trial. Congressional power of the
   purse was protected by forbidding taxes or restraint on interstate
   commerce and foreign trade. States could make no law "impairing the
   obligation of contracts."^[86]^[z] To check future state abuses the
   framers searched for a way to review and veto state laws harming the
   national welfare or citizen rights. They rejected proposals for
   Congressional veto of state laws and gave the Supreme Court appellate
   case jurisdiction over state law because the Constitution is the
   supreme law of the land.^[88] The United States had such a geographical
   extent that it could only be safely governed using a combination of
   republics. Federal judicial districts would follow those state
   lines.^[84]

Population power[edit]

   The British had relied upon a concept of "virtual representation" to
   give legitimacy to their House of Commons. It was not necessary to
   elect anyone from a large port city, or the American colonies, because
   the representatives of "rotten boroughs", the mostly abandoned medieval
   fair towns with twenty voters, "virtually represented" them.
   Philadelphia in the colonies was second in population only to
   London.^[89]

   They were all Englishmen, supposed to be a single people, with one
   definable interest. Legitimacy came from membership in Parliament of
   the sovereign realm, not elections from people. As Blackstone
   explained, the Member is "not bound ... to consult with, or take the
   advice, of his constituents." As Constitutional historian Gordon Wood
   elaborated, "The Commons of England contained all of the people's power
   and were considered to be the very persons of the people they
   represented."^[90]

                                                   New states or provinces

       *

                                 G. Morris, (PA)
                                provinces forever

   While the English "virtual representation" was hardening into a theory
   of Parliamentary sovereignty, the American theory of representation was
   moving towards a theory of sovereignty of the people. In their new
   constitutions written since 1776, Americans required community
   residency of voters and representatives, expanded suffrage, and
   equalized populations in voting districts. There was a sense that
   representation "had to be proportioned to the population."^[91] The
   Convention would apply the new principle of "sovereignty of the people"
   both to the House of Representatives, and to the United States Senate.

   House changes. Once the Great Compromise was reached, delegates in
   Convention then agreed to a decennial census to count the population.
   The Americans themselves did not allow for universal suffrage for all
   adults.^[aa] Their sort of "virtual representation" said that those
   voting in a community could understand and themselves represent
   non-voters when they had like interests that were unlike other
   political communities. There were enough differences among people in
   different American communities for those differences to have a
   meaningful social and economic reality. Thus New England colonial
   legislatures would not tax communities which had not yet elected
   representatives. When the royal governor of Georgia refused to allow
   representation to be seated from four new counties, the legislature
   refused to tax them.^[93]

   The 1776 Americans had begun to demand expansion of the franchise, and
   in each step, they found themselves pressing towards a philosophical
   "actuality of consent."^[94] The Convention determined that the power
   of the people, should be felt in the House of Representatives. For the
   U.S. Congress, persons alone were counted. Property was not counted.

   Senate changes. The Convention found it more difficult to give
   expression to the will of the people in new states. What state might be
   "lawfully arising" outside the boundaries of the existing thirteen
   states?^[95] The new government was like the old, to be made up of
   pre-existing states. Now there was to be admission of new states.
   Regular order would provide new states by state legislatures for
   Kentucky, Tennessee and Maine. But the Articles Congress had by its
   Northwest Ordnance presented the Convention with a new issue. Settlers
   in the Northwest Territory might one day constitute themselves into "no
   more than five" states. More difficult still, most delegates
   anticipated adding alien peoples of Canada, Louisiana and Florida to
   United States territory.^[96] Generally in American history, European
   citizens of empire were given U.S. citizenship on territorial
   acquisition. Should they become states?

   Some delegates were reluctant to expand into any so "remote
   wilderness". It would retard the commercial development of the east.
   They would be easily influenced, "foreign gold" would corrupt them.
   Western peoples were the least desirable Americans, only good for
   perpetual provinces.^[97] There were so many foreigners moving out
   west, there was no telling how things would turn out. These were poor
   people, they could not pay their fair share of taxes. It would be
   "suicide" for the original states. New states could become a majority
   in the Senate, they would abuse their power, "enslaving" the original
   thirteen. If they also loved liberty, and could not tolerate eastern
   state dominance, they would be justified in civil war. Western trade
   interests could drag the country into an inevitable war with Spain for
   the Mississippi River.^[98] As time wore on, any war for the
   Mississippi River was obviated by the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and the
   1812 American victory at New Orleans.

   Even if there were to be western states, a House representation of
   40,000 might be too small, too easy for the westerners. "States" had
   been declared out west already. They called themselves republics, and
   set up their own courts directly from the people without colonial
   charters. In Transylvania, Westsylvania, Franklin, and Vandalia,
   "legislatures" met with emissaries from British and Spanish Empires in
   violation of the Articles of Confederation, just as the sovereign
   states had done.^[ab] In the Constitution as written, no majorities in
   Congress could break up the larger states without their consent.^[96]

   "New state" advocates had no fear of western states achieving a
   majority one day. For example, the British sought to curb American
   growth. That brought hate, then separation. Follow the same rule, get
   the same results. Congress has never been able to discover a better
   rule than majority rule. If they grow, let them rule. As they grow,
   they must get all their supplies from eastern businesses. Character is
   not determined by points of a compass. States admitted are equals, they
   will be made up of our brethren. Commit to right principles, even if
   the right way, one day, benefits other states. They will be free like
   ourselves, their pride will not allow anything but equality.^[100]

   It was at this time in the Convention that Reverend Manasseh Cutler
   arrived to lobby for western land sales. He brought acres of land
   grants to parcel out. Their sales would fund most of the U.S.
   government expenditures for its first few decades. There were
   allocations for the Ohio Company stockholders at the Convention, and
   for others delegates too. Good to his word, in December 1787, Cutler
   led a small band of pioneers into the Ohio Valley.^[101]

   The provision for admitting new states became relevant at the purchase
   of Louisiana. It was constitutionally justifiable under the "treaty
   making" power of the Federal government. The agrarian advocates sought
   to make the purchase of land that had never been administered,
   conquered, or formally ceded to any of the original thirteen states.
   Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans would divide the Louisiana Purchase
   into states, speeding land sales to finance the Federal government with
   no new taxes. The new populations of new states would swamp the
   commercial states in the Senate. They would populate the House with
   egalitarian Democrat-Republicans to overthrow the Federalists.^[ac]
   Jefferson dropped the proposal of Constitutional amendment to permit
   the purchase, and with it, his notion of a confederation of sovereign
   states.^[102]

Final document[edit]

   After nearly four months of debate, on September 8, 1787, the final
   text of the Constitution was set down and revised. Then, an official
   copy of the document was engrossed by Jacob Shallus. The effort
   consisted of copying the text (prelude, articles and endorsement) on
   four sheets of vellum parchment, made from treated animal skin and
   measuring approximately 28 inches (71 cm) by 23 inches (58 cm),
   probably with a goose quill. Shallus engrossed the entire document
   except for the list of states at the end of the document, which are in
   Alexander Hamilton's handwriting.^[103] On September 17, 1787,
   following a speech given by Benjamin Franklin, 39 delegates endorsed
   and submitted the Constitution to the Congress of the
   Confederation.^[104]

Ratification of the Constitution[edit]

   Rufus King, MA
   For ratifying Constitution, influenced VA & NY
   Luther Martin, MD
   "Anti" in Articles Congress,
   lost "Amend Articles" vote
   Patrick Henry, VA
   "Anti" like those in MA, NY, SC, lost "Amend before" vote
   James Madison, VA
   pushed "Amendments after", the Bill of Rights

   Massachusetts' Rufus King assessed the Convention as a creature of the
   states, independent of the Articles Congress, submitting its proposal
   to Congress only to satisfy forms. Though amendments were debated, they
   were all defeated. On September 28, 1787, the Articles Congress
   resolved "unanimously" to transmit the Constitution to state
   legislatures for submitting to a ratification convention according to
   the Constitutional procedure.^[105] Several states enlarged the numbers
   qualified just for electing ratification delegates. In doing so, they
   went beyond the Constitution's provision for the most voters for the
   state legislature.^[ad]

   Delaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new
   Constitution, with its vote being unanimous. Pennsylvania ratified on
   December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46 to 23 (66.67%). New Jersey ratified
   on December 19, 1787, and Georgia on January 2, 1788, both with
   unanimous votes. The requirement of ratification by nine states, set by
   Article Seven of the Constitution, was met when New Hampshire voted to
   ratify, on June 21, 1788.

   In New York, fully two thirds of the convention delegates were at first
   opposed to the Constitution. Hamilton led the Federalist campaign,
   which included the fast-paced appearance of the Federalist Papers in
   New York newspapers. An attempt to attach conditions to ratification
   almost succeeded, but on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a
   recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close –
   yeas 30 (52.6%), nays 27 – due largely to Hamilton's forensic abilities
   and his reaching a few key compromises with moderate anti-Federalists
   led by Melancton Smith.^[ae]

   Following Massachusetts's lead, the Federalist minorities in both
   Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by
   linking ratification to recommended amendments.^[112] A minority of the
   Constitution's critics continued to oppose the Constitution. Maryland's
   Luther Martin argued that the federal convention had exceeded its
   authority; he still called for amending the Articles.^[113] Article 13
   of the Articles of Confederation stated that the union created under
   the Articles was "perpetual" and that any alteration must be "agreed to
   in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the
   legislatures of every State".^[114]

   However, the unanimous requirement under the Articles made all attempts
   at reform impossible. Martin's allies such as New York's John Lansing,
   Jr., dropped moves to obstruct the Convention's process. They began to
   take exception to the Constitution "as it was", seeking amendments.
   Several conventions saw supporters for "amendments before" shift to a
   position of "amendments after" for the sake of staying in the Union.
   New York Anti's "circular letter" was sent to each state legislature
   proposing a second constitutional convention for "amendments before".
   It failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately only North Carolina and
   Rhode Island would wait for amendments from Congress before
   ratifying.^[112]

   Article VII of the proposed constitution stipulated that only nine of
   the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government to go
   into effect for the participating states.^[115] After a year had passed
   in state-by-state ratification battles, on September 13, 1788, the
   Articles Congress certified that the new Constitution had been
   ratified. The new government would be inaugurated with eleven of the
   thirteen. The Articles Congress directed the new government to begin in
   New York City on the first Wednesday in March,^[116] and on March 4,
   1789, the government duly began operations.

   George Washington had earlier been reluctant to go the Convention for
   fear the states "with their darling sovereignties" could not be
   overcome.^[117] But he was elected the Constitution's President
   unanimously, including the vote of Virginia's presidential elector, the
   Anti-federalist Patrick Henry.^[118] The new Congress was a triumph for
   the Federalists. The Senate of eleven states would be 20 Federalists to
   two Virginia (Henry) Anti-federalists. The House would seat 48
   Federalists to 11 Antis from only four states: Massachusetts, New York,
   Virginia and South Carolina.^[119]

   Anti-Federalists' fears of personal oppression by Congress were allayed
   by amendments passed under the floor leadership of James Madison during
   the first session of the 1st United States Congress. These first ten
   Amendments became known as the Bill of Rights.^[120]

   Objections to a potentially remote federal judiciary were reconciled
   with 13 federal courts (11 states, Maine and Kentucky), and three
   Federal riding circuits out of the Supreme Court: Eastern, Middle and
   South.^[121] Suspicion of a powerful federal executive was answered by
   Washington's cabinet appointments of once-Anti-Federalists Edmund
   Jennings Randolph as Attorney General and Thomas Jefferson as Secretary
   of State.^[122]^[123] What Constitutional historian Pauline Maier calls
   a national "dialogue between power and liberty" had begun anew.^[124]

   By the end of July 1788, eleven states had ratified the Constitution,
   and soon thereafter, the process of organizing the new government
   began. On September 13, 1788, Congress fixed the city of New York as
   the seat of the new government. (The capital was moved to Philadelphia
   in 1790 and to Washington D.C., in 1800.) It set Wednesday, January 7,
   1789 as the day for choosing presidential electors; Wednesday, February
   4 for the meeting of the electors to select a president, and Wednesday,
   March 4 for the opening session of the new Congress and the beginning
   of the first presidential term. Thus, March 4, 1789 became inauguration
   day.

   Under the Constitution, each state legislature had the power to decide
   how presidential electors, as well as representatives and senators,
   would be chosen. Some states opted for direct elections by the people,
   others for election by the legislature, and a few for a combination of
   the two. Rivalries were intense; delays in setting up the first
   elections under the new Constitution were inevitable. New Jersey, for
   example, chose direct elections but neglected to set a time for closing
   the polls, which stayed open for three weeks.^[citation needed]

   By March 4, 1789, when the first Congress opened, only 13 of the 59
   representatives and 8 of the 22 senators had arrived in New York City.
   (Seats allotted to North Carolina and Rhode Island were not filled
   until those states ratified the Constitution.) A quorum was finally
   attained in the House on April 1 and in the Senate on April 6. On April
   1, the House elected a Speaker, and on April 6, the Senate elected its
   President pro tempore. The two houses then met jointly to count the
   electoral vote.

   George Washington was unanimously elected the first president, and John
   Adams of Massachusetts, the vice president. Adams arrived in New York
   on April 21, and Washington arrived two days later. Both were sworn
   into office on April 30, 1789. The business of setting up the new
   government was completed.

Amendments to the Constitution[edit]

   Since the beginning of federal operations under the Constitution in
   1789 through the beginning of 2013, approximately 11,539 proposals to
   amend the Constitution have been introduced in the United States
   Congress.^[125] Of these, thirty-three have been approved by Congress
   and sent to the states for ratification. Twenty-seven of these
   amendments have been ratified and are now part of the Constitution. The
   first ten amendments were adopted and ratified simultaneously and are
   known collectively as the Bill of Rights. Prior to the Twenty-seventh
   Amendment, which languished for 202 years, 7 months, 12 days before
   being ratified (submitted for ratification in 1789 as part of the Bill
   of Rights, but not ratified until 1992), the Twenty-second Amendment
   held the record for longest time taken to successfully complete the
   ratification process – 3 years, 11 months, 6 days. The Twenty-sixth
   Amendment holds the record for shortest time taken – 3 months, 8
   days.^[126] Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states
   have not been ratified by the required number of states and are not
   part of the Constitution. Four of these are still technically open and
   pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is
   closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it.
   The U.S. constitutional amendment process.

Bill of Rights[edit]

   Main article: United States Bill of Rights

   Much of opposition to the proposed Constitution within several states
   arose, not because the machinery of the new frame of government was
   considered unworkable or because strengthening the union between the 13
   states viewed as undesirable. The debates in the state ratifying
   conventions centered around the absence of anything equivalent to the
   bill of rights found in several state constitutions.^[127] George
   Mason, a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, and the author
   of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, refused to sign the document
   because he felt it did not specifically spell out or protect individual
   rights sufficiently. He also opposed the constitution when it was
   brought before the state for ratification. He acquiesced and the
   convention voted narrowly to give its assent only after it was decided
   that a list of twenty proposed amendments be sent along with the
   state's resolution of ratification. Delegates to Massachusetts'
   convention had many of the same concerns, and along with its
   notification of approval made a request for nine alterations, the first
   among them being "that it be explicitly declared that all powers not
   specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved to
   the states to be exercised by them." New York, not to be outdone,
   appended a list of thirty-two requested amendments plus a lengthy
   statement of impressions and explanations about the new Constitution to
   their affirmative vote.^[127]

   The sharp Anti-Federalist critique of the Constitution did not abate
   after it became operational, and by the time the First Congress
   convened in March 1789, there existed widespread sentiment in both the
   House and Senate in favor of making alterations. That September,
   Congress adopted twelve amendments and sent to the states for
   ratification. Ten of these were ratified by the required number of
   states in December 1791 and became part of the Constitution. These
   amendments enumerate freedoms not explicitly indicated in the main body
   of the Constitution, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, a
   free press, and free assembly; the right to keep and bear arms; freedom
   from unreasonable search and seizure, security in personal effects, and
   freedom from warrants issued without probable cause; indictment by a
   grand jury for a capital or "infamous crime"; guarantee of a speedy,
   public trial with an impartial jury; and prohibition of double
   jeopardy. In addition, the Bill of Rights reserves for the people any
   rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution and reserves all
   powers not specifically granted to the federal government to the people
   or the States.

Subsequent amendments[edit]

   Amendments to the Constitution subsequent to the Bill of Rights cover a
   wide range of subjects. Several have added significant content to the
   original document. One of the most far-reaching is the Fourteenth,
   ratified in 1868, which establishes a clear and simple definition of
   citizenship and guarantees equal treatment under the law. Also
   significant are the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-fourth, and
   Twenty-sixth, which were enacted to extend the right to vote to persons
   previously considered ineligible and also to protect their exercise of
   that right. One Amendment, the Eighteenth, which criminalized the
   production, transport and sale of alcohol nationwide, was later
   repealed by another, the Twenty-first. Nine ratified amendments
   (11,^[128] 12,^[129] 13,^[128] 14,^[130] 16,^[131] 17,^[132] 20,^[133]
   22,^[134] and 25^[135]) have explicitly superseded or modified the text
   of the original Constitution.
   Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3a^α Regarding how the apportionment
   of representatives and direct taxes
   among the states is determined. Superseded by the Fourteenth Amendment,
   Section 2
   Article 1, Section 3, Clause 1 Regarding the senators from each
   state being chosen by the
   legislature of that state. Superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment,
   Section 1^β
   Article 1, Section 3, Clause 2 Regarding the filling of vacancies
   in the senate. Superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, Section 2
   Article 1, Section 4, Clause 2 Regarding when each year the
   Congress must assemble. Modified by the Twentieth Amendment, Section 2
   Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4 Regarding Congress' restricted
   taxation power. Superseded by the Sixteenth Amendment
   Article 2, Section 1, Clause 1b Regarding the length of the
   president's and vice president's
   term of office. Temporarily modified^γ by the Twentieth Amendment,
   Section 1
   Article 2, Section 1, Clause 3 Regarding Electoral College
   voting procedures. Superseded by the Twelfth Amendment^δ
   Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 Regarding eligibility for
   holding the office of president. Modified by the Twenty-second
   Amendment, Section 1
   Article 2, Section 1, Clause 6 Regarding presidential powers and
   duties if the presidency is vacant
   or if the President is unable to
   discharge said powers and duties. Superseded by the Twenty-fifth
   Amendment
   Article 3, Section 2, Clause 1 Regarding the diversity jurisdiction
   given to the judiciary to hear cases
   between a state and citizens
   of another state. Modified by the Eleventh Amendment
   Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 Regarding persons held (involuntarily)
   to service or labor. Superseded by the Thirteenth Amendment, Section 1
   α – In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment rendered the formula prescribed
   in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, whereby only three-fifths of all
   other Persons (slaves) were counted when determining a state's total
   population for apportionment purposes, moot de jure. Three years later,
   the entire first sentence of the clause was superseded by the
   Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2. This later amendment however, left
   Congress' taxation power unchanged, as the replacement clause in it
   made no mention of apportionment of direct taxes. Even so, Congress'
   ability to levy taxes was still governed by Article 1 Section 9 Clause
   4 of the Constitution.
   β – Section 1 of the Seventeenth Amendment, regarding the six year term
   of office for Senators, was shortened for those persons whose term as
   senator ended on March 4, 1935, 1937, and 1939, by the interval between
   January 3 and March 4, of that year (61 days) by the Twentieth
   Amendment, which became part of the Constitution on January 23, 1933
   and the changes made by Section 1 took effect on October 15, 1933. This
   amendment also had a de facto affect on Article 1, Section 2, Clause
   1a, for although the election was held as prescribed, the term of
   office for the persons elected to Congress in November 1932, was in
   effect shortened by the same interval of days.
   γ – The term of office for the persons elected President and Vice
   President (Franklin D. Roosevelt and John Nance Garner respectively) in
   November 1932, was shortened by the interval between January 20 and
   March 4, 1937 (44 days), by the Twentieth Amendment.
   δ – The fourth sentence of the Twelfth Amendment, regarding the Vice
   President acting as President if the House, when the choice is theirs
   to make, has not elected a President by March 4, has been superseded by
   the Twentieth Amendment, Section 3.

Criticism of the Constitution[edit]

Expand democracy[edit]

   In the early twentieth century Lochner era, the Supreme Court ruled
   unconstitutional various state laws that limited labor contracts. The
   Constitution was criticized as putting the government at the beck and
   call of big business.^[136]

   More recent criticism has often been academic and limited to particular
   features. University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson wonders
   whether it makes sense to give "Wyoming the same number of votes as
   California, which has roughly seventy times the population".^[137]
   Levinson thinks this imbalance causes a "steady redistribution of
   resources from large states to small states."^[137] Levinson is
   critical of the Electoral College as it allows the possibility of
   electing presidents who do not win the majority, or even plurality, of
   votes.^[137] Four times in American history, presidents have been
   elected despite failing to win a plurality of the popular vote: 1824
   (John Quincy Adams), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes), 1888 (Benjamin
   Harrison) and 2000 (George W. Bush).^[138]^[139]^[140]^[141] The
   current Constitution does not give the people a quick way to remove
   incompetent or ill presidents, in his view.^[141] Others have
   criticized gerrymandering.^[142]

   Yale professor Robert A. Dahl sees a problem with an American tendency
   towards worship of the Constitution itself. (See American civil
   religion) He sees aspects of American governance which are "unusual and
   potentially undemocratic: the federal system, the bicameral
   legislature, judicial review, presidentialism, and the electoral
   college system."^[143] Levinson and Labunski and others have called for
   a Second Constitutional Convention,^[144] although professors like Dahl
   believe there is no real hope this would ever happen.^[143] French
   journalist Jean-Philippe Immarigeon wrote in Harper's that the "nearly
   230-year-old constitution stretched past the limits of its usefulness",
   and suggested key problem points were the inability to call an election
   when government became gridlocked, a several month period between
   inauguration of a president and when he or she takes office, and
   inability of the lower house of Congress to influence serious foreign
   policy decisions such as participation in war.^[145]

   University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato advocates an amendment to
   organize presidential primaries.^[146] Sabato details more objections
   in his book A More Perfect Constitution. ^[146]^[147] He opposes life
   tenure for Supreme Court judges."^[147] He also writes that "If the 26
   least populated states voted as a bloc, they would control the U.S.
   Senate with a total of just under 17% of the country's
   population."^[147] Sabato further contends that the Constitution is in
   need of an overhaul, and argues that only a national constitutional
   convention can bring the document up to date and settle many of the
   issues that have arisen over the past two centuries.^[148]

States' rights[edit]

   John C. Calhoun

   In United States history, four periods of widespread Constitutional
   criticism have been characterized by the idea that specific political
   powers belong to state governments and not to the federal government—a
   doctrine commonly known as states rights. At each stage, states' rights
   advocates failed to develop a preponderance in public opinion or to
   sustain the democratic political will required to alter the generally
   held constitutional understanding and political practice in the United
   States. At its adoption among the people in the state ratification
   conventions, the "men of original principles" opposed the new national
   government as violating the Whig philosophy generally accepted among
   the original thirteen colonies in 1776. According to this view,
   Congress as a legislature should be only equal to any state
   legislature, and only the people in each state might be sovereign. They
   are now referred to as the Anti-Federalists in American historiography.
   The proponents of "state sovereignty" and "states rights" were outvoted
   in eleven of thirteen state ratification conventions, then thirteen of
   thirteen, to "ordain and establish" the Constitution.

   During Andrew Jackson's administration, South Carolina objected to U.S.
   government's "tariff of abominations" collected as Federal duties in
   Charleston Harbor. The Nullification Crisis ensued. Justification for
   the nullifiers was found in the U.S. Senate speeches and writings of
   John C. Calhoun. He defended slavery against the Constitutional
   provisions allowing its statutory regulation or its eventual abolition
   by Constitutional amendment, most notably in his Disquisition on
   Government. The crisis was averted when once General Jackson declared
   he would march a U.S. army into South Carolina and hang the first
   nullifier he saw from the first tree, and a new negotiated tariff, the
   Compromise Tariff of 1833, satisfactory to South Carolina was enacted.
   Abraham Lincoln kept a portrait of Andrew Jackson above his desk at the
   War Department during efforts to defend the Constitution as understood
   by a national majority of people and states at that time.

   In the mid-19th Century during the administrations of Abraham Lincoln,
   Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, the United States suffered a
   tragic passage through the Civil War and Reconstruction. An important
   survey of the philosophical and legal underpinnings of "States Rights"
   as held by secessionists and Lost Cause advocates afterwards is found
   in the speeches of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his Rise
   and Fall of the Confederate Government. Davis defended secession by
   appealing to the "original principles" of the Founders' 1776
   Revolutionary generation, and by expanding on William Blackstone's
   doctrine of legislative supremacy. By the elections of 1872, all states
   which had been admitted to the United States in accordance with the
   Constitution were fully represented in the U.S. Congress.
   Jefferson Davis

   Following the Supreme Court 1954 holding in Brown v. Board of
   Education, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used National Guard and U.S.
   paratroopers to enforce the rulings of the Federal Courts as they
   pertained to the Constitution. The "States Rights" doctrine was again
   appealed to during the mid-20th Century resistance to racial
   integration in the schools, notably in Arkansas' Little Rock Nine,
   Alabama's Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, and Virginia's Massive
   Resistance. Public schools in every state are now racially integrated
   by law under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.

   The tradition is seen in many shorter episodes of limited minority
   protest against the United States. During the War of 1812, Federalists
   conducted a Hartford Convention proposing New England secession during
   wartime to reopen trade with the declared enemy of the United States.
   It led to accusations of treason and the demise of the Federalist Party
   as a force in American politics. In 1921, the Maryland Attorney General
   sued to block woman suffrage. He argued in Leser v. Garnett that state
   legislatures were Constitutionally the sole determiners of who should
   vote in what Federal or state elections, and that the 19th Amendment
   was improper. The Supreme Court's judicial review of the state court
   findings held that the 19th Amendment was Constitutional, and that it
   applied to the women's right to vote in every state. Women now vote in
   every state under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.

   One exceptional example of "states rights" persuading overwhelming
   majorities in a democratic and sustained way, and so transforming the
   nation came in the John Adams administration. Fear had spread that
   radical democratic sentiment might turn subversive as it had in the
   French Reign of Terror. But the Federalist-sponsored Alien and Sedition
   Acts meant to preempt the danger led to suppression of opposition
   press. The political reaction in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions
   sparked public opposition against the Federalist policy and led to
   twenty-four years of Constitutionally elected Democratic-Republican
   Party rule through six administrations of Thomas Jefferson, James
   Madison and James Monroe.

   Since the Nullification Crisis, the doctrine of states' rights has been
   asserted again by opponents of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,
   proponents of California's Specific Contract Act of 1863 (which
   nullified the Legal Tender Act of 1862), opponents of Federal acts
   prohibiting the sale and possession of marijuana in the first decade of
   the 21st century, and opponents of implementation of laws and
   regulations pertaining to firearms from the late 1900s up to 2013. Even
   when a formal constitutional attack is not advanced, the topic of
   states' rights can and has been invoked in policy debates. One example
   of a recent win for states' rights was the repeal of the national
   55 mph speed limit, and returning authority to set speed limits to the
   states.

History of the physical document[edit]

   At first, little interest was shown in the parchment object itself.
   Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–9) but having
   left Washington, he had lost track of it in the years leading to his
   death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the
   Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found the parchment
   folded in a small tin box on the floor of a closet at the State, War
   and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration
   and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a
   safe.^[149]

   The two parchment documents were turned over to the Library of Congress
   by executive order, and in 1924 President Coolidge dedicated the
   bronze-and-marble shrine for public display of the Constitution at the
   main building. The parchments were laid over moisture absorbing
   cellulose paper, vacuum-sealed between double panes of insulated plate
   glass, and protected from light by a gelatin film. Although building
   construction of the Archives Building was completed in 1935, in
   December 1941 they were moved from the Library of Congress until
   September 1944, stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository, Fort Knox,
   Kentucky. In 1951 following a study by the National Bureau of Standards
   to protect from atmosphere, insects, mold and light, the parchments
   were re-encased with special light filters, inert helium gas and proper
   humidity. They were transferred to the National Archives in 1952.^[150]

   Since 1952, the "Charters of Freedom" have been displayed in the
   Rotunda of the National Archives Building. Visual inspections have been
   enhanced by electronic imaging. Changes in the cases led to removal
   from their cases July 2001, preservation treatment by conservators, and
   installment in new encasements for public display in September
   2003.^[151]^[152]^[153]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ The colonists, for example, claimed the right "to life, liberty,
       and property", "the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and
       natural-born subjects within the realm of England"; the right to
       participate in legislative councils; "the great and inestimable
       privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according
       to the course of [the common law of England]"; "the immunities and
       privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters, or
       secured by their several codes of provincial laws"; "a right
       peaceably to assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition
       the king." They further declared that the keeping of a standing
       army in the colonies in time of peace without the consent of the
       colony in which the army was kept was "against law"; that it was
       "indispensably necessary to good government, and rendered essential
       by the English constitution, that the constituent branches of the
       legislature be independent of each other"; that certain acts of
       Parliament in contravention of the foregoing principles were
       "infringement and violations of the rights of the colonists." Text

Footnotes[edit]

    1. ^ Historians following Charles A. Beard emphasize this aspect of
       the U.S. Constitution. Although An Economic Interpretation of the
       Constitution of the United States is discredited among modern
       scholars, Beard's legacy is that the economic, financial and
       commercial aspects of American history are almost always included
       in a survey of any topic.
    2. ^ The meeting at Mount Vernon was past and prologue. All nine were
       leaders in the Revolution, seven served in the Continental
       Congress. Five attended the Constitutional Convention, one later
       served the new government as Attorney General, two on the Supreme
       Court, and two as President. In the Revolution, three served in
       uniform, two were judges, two merchants, one financier. Two had
       been immigrants. The host was George Washington, General of the
       Continental Army, President of the Constitutional Convention and
       first U.S. President. Commissioner and Virginia jurist George Mason
       was the "Father of the Virginia Bill of Rights" and attended the
       Constitutional Convention and the Virginia Ratification Convention.
       Edmund Randolph, was a Continental Army officer, member of Congress
       and the Constitutional Convention, would be Virginia governor and
       U.S. Attorney General. (Neither Randolph nor Madison actually
       attended the conference; Gov. Patrick Henry had not informed them
       of the date. )James Madison, signer of the Declaration, member of
       Congress, "Father of the Constitution" at the Convention, led the
       Virginia Ratification Convention, "Father of the Bill of Rights",
       and President. Alexander Henderson served during the Revolution as
       an officer in the Virginia militia. He was a Scottish-born
       merchant, the "Father of the American chain store". The Maryland
       commissioners included jurist Thomas Johnson from England. He was
       the first independent Governor of Maryland and member of Congress
       serving on a finance committee with later Convention members
       Benjamin Franklin, John Dickinson and future Chief Justice John
       Jay. Johnson himself would be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Wealthy
       Thomas Stone was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and
       championed Union when Maryland was reluctantly the last to sign the
       Articles of Confederation. Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer was a
       member of Congress who worked with Benjamin Franklin, James
       Madison, John Dickinson and George Washington. Jenifer was the
       financial administrator for Maryland who helped it recover from
       economic depression, and a member of the Constitutional Convention.
       Samuel Chase signed the Declaration of Independence and served on
       the U.S. Supreme Court.
    3. ^ In the event, the signed Constitution was merely forwarded to the
       state legislatures without amendment or endorsement. But the states
       did receive a recommendation that each call a ratification
       convention apart from the state legislature according to each
       state's suffrage and timing. All but Rhode Island did so. Rhode
       Island and North Carolina did not join the United States until
       after the Constitutional government began in 1789.^[18]
    4. ^ George Washington's participation lent his prestige to the
       proceedings, attracting some of the best minds in America. Though
       some 1776 notables did not attend, such as older generation Tom
       Paine, Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, and middle generation Thomas
       Jefferson, and John Adams.
    5. ^ In the Articles Congress, a state could not be represented on the
       floor until two delegates were present. The Convention quorum of
       seven states was met the first day with New York with two of its
       five delegates present that first day, New Jersey with three,
       Pennsylvania with four of its eight, Delaware with three of its
       five, Virginia with all seven, North Carolina with four of its
       five, and South Carolina with all four. Massachusetts and Georgia
       had each one delegate of their respective four present on the 25th.
       See Constitutional Convention for a complete listing of state
       delegations arrived in Philadelphia.
    6. ^ The rules of a formal body can determine outcomes. The
       nationalist "Federalists" will make a point of setting the rules to
       win the later ratification conventions. Their ratification strategy
       was to take up each article and section, with no votes on measures
       until completing the document.^[19] This delay suited different
       objectives. The intent was to persuade in Massachusetts,^[20] to
       accommodate in Virginia,^[21] and to await news in New York^[22]
    7. ^ In view of the Martin-Lansing "small state" positions and their
       importance in U.S. intellectual history, relative sizes of the
       states in 1787 can be ranked from the Constitution's enumeration
       for the first House of Representatives. States free or with gradual
       emancipation had 35 Representatives: Pennsylvania eight.
       Massachusetts eight, New York six, Connecticut five, New Jersey
       four, New Hampshire three, Rhode Island one. States with a sizable
       3/5 bonus for non-citizen slaves had 30 representatives at first:
       Virginia ten, Maryland six, North Carolina five, South Carolina
       five, Georgia three and Delaware one. (See U.S. Constitution,
       Article I, Section 2.)
    8. ^ Both the British House of Commons and their North American
       colonial assemblies were secret. Debates of the Articles Congress
       were not reported.^[23]
    9. ^ Manasseh Cutler was a Congregationalists minister and former Army
       chaplain from Massachusetts. He arrived directly from lobbying
       success in New York City during the Northwest Ordnance negotiations
       at the Articles Congress.^[28]
   10. ^ Elements of Randolph's "Virginia Plan" proposal as submitted were
       not adopted. Members of Congress did not have one term, then barred
       from any U.S. or state office for a number of years after. A
       'senate' was not apportioned by state taxes paid. The 'senate' is
       not elected by the 'house' from state legislature nominees.
       Congress does not veto state laws, and coerce noncompliant states.
       The 'president' might be elected by Congress for two terms. A
       "council of revision" made up of the 'president' and some of the
       'supreme court' could veto any act of Congress or veto of state
       legislature. None of these provisions were incorporated into the
       draft "Constitution" as forwarded by Congress to the states for
       their ratification conventions of representatives of the people
       voting, as each state legislature allowed.^[37]
   11. ^ Elements of Paterson's "New Jersey Plan" proposal as submitted
       were not adopted. State courts did not interpret federal
       legislation, with appeals to the Supreme Court only. States in the
       Union cannot be "diminished". Presidents are one person, not three
       persons. Presidents can serve more than one term. A majority of
       state Governors cannot remove a President. The rule of
       naturalization was not the same for every state in the 19th
       Century. Immigrants could become citizens and vote in northern
       states years before they were eligible for U.S. citizenship. Powers
       not expressly enumerated belong to the states was out-voted in
       Convention, but in the first ten amendments, the Tenth Amendment
       specifies powers not expressly given to the Congress reside with
       the states or with the people.^[40]
   12. ^ The Constitution sets up a bicameral legislature which enacts law
       only if there are national majorities both among (a) the states in
       the 'senate' and (b) the people in the 'house'. At the time the
       Constitution was ratified, it balanced states equally relative to
       slavery in the Senate. There were six states north of Pennsylvania,
       and six states south of it. Pennsylvania, the "keystone" state,
       split Senators one-one at first. After Pennsylvania abolished
       slavery, the next state to enter the Union in 1792 was Kentucky
       with slavery. That maintains a "sectional equality" between
       free-soil states and slave-holding states, 7-7. Then in 1850,
       California was admitted as a free state, then Minnesota, Oregon and
       Kansas followed as free states before outbreak of the Civil War.
       The Constitution's House of Representatives began nearly equal, but
       the decennial census reallocated power away from declining
       slave-economies and towards the places which supported more people.
       Over time, ten years at a time, under the Constitution, the state
       antecedents, wealth, commerce and militias matter less than the
       numbers of people it can sustain in its domestic economy.
   13. ^ Section 2 of Article I provides in part: "Representatives and
       direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states ... by
       adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound
       to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed,
       three-fifths of all other persons." State population for U.S.
       representation or taxes was to exclude all numbers of untaxed
       Native-Americans.—"Representatives and direct taxes shall be
       apportioned among the several states ... by adding to the whole
       number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term
       of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all
       other persons".
   14. ^ He was the son of a shoemaker, now a farmer and lawyer. Although
       awkward, vulgar and laughable to more polished colleagues, he was
       an honest political broker. The most frequent speakers on the
       Convention floor were Madison, Wilson, G. Morris, all nationalists.
       Roger Sherman of Connecticut, a small-state 'federal' delegate, was
       fourth. His legislative philosophy was, "When you are a minority,
       talk. When you are a majority, vote." Among the small-state
       advocates, he would make the most speeches throughout the
       Convention.^[51] Arriving right behind the nationalist leaders on
       May 30, Sherman was reported to prefer a "patch up" of the existing
       Confederacy. ^[52] Another small state delegate, George Read (DE)
       agreed with the nationalists that state legislatures were a
       national problem. But rather than see larger states overshadow the
       small, he'd prefer to see all state boundaries erased. Big-state
       versus small-state antagonisms hardened early.^[53]
   15. ^ The nationalists had proposed a 'senate' smaller than the
       'house', but still proportioned by population: one senator for
       small, two senators for medium, and three senators for large
       population states. Sherman argued that the bicameral British
       Parliament had a House of Lords equal with the House of Commons to
       protect their propertied interests apart from the people. He was
       voted down, this time by the big states.
   16. ^ The most important were Lansing and Yates (NY), Bedford (DE),
       Paterson and Brearly (NJ) and Martin (MD). Other supporters of note
       were Mason (VA), Gerry (MA), Ellsworth and Sherman (CT).^[57]
   17. ^ Yates and Lansing (NY) would walk out July 10. New York voted as
       a "small" state on big-state-small-state issues. It had no western
       frontier like Pennsylvania and Virginia, for instance. In 1787, the
       Erie Canal did not tie New York to the west, and Philadelphia was
       still the nation's largest commercial and banking center, followed
       by Boston.^[60]
   18. ^ Pierce Butler of South Carolina was generally a nationalist,
       representing up-country interests against the state-dominating big
       plantations, but on this, he switched between Resolution 7 and
       Resolution 8, speaking with the small-states, supporting a two- or
       three-person 'presidency'. Cromwell had started well enough, but
       his Interregnum turned out badly.
   19. ^ The Articles of Confederation gave Congress control of (1) the
       military: appoint and commission officers, build a navy, regulate
       uniform justice, and use privateers. (2) international relations:
       declare war and make peace, exchange ambassadors, enter treaties
       and alliances, establish admiralty courts, punish crimes on the
       high seas and regulate captures, and manage trade and affairs with
       non-state Indians. (3) commerce: value of coin, uniform standards
       of weights and measures, post offices, borrow money and establish
       courts to adjudicate issues between states.^[77]
   20. ^ McDonald lists his five "minor powers" as governing the federal
       district, punishing crimes against the law of nations, copyrights
       and patents, bankruptcies and counterfeiting.^[78]
   21. ^ States would lose more powers with the addition of Constitutional
       Amendments, the 14th will extend national Bill of Rights freedoms
       to states, the 15th and 19th will enlarge state citizenship, and
       the 18th will strip state legislatures of U.S. Senator election.
   22. ^ Property right provisions included prohibiting restrictions on
       slavery within the country until 1808; banning export duties,
       direct taxes, and port preference; taxing interstate commerce, and
       confiscating estates.
   23. ^ Guarantees for liberty in the original Constitution included
       prohibiting suspension of the writ of habeas corpus except in times
       of rebellion or invasion, prohibiting ex post facto laws and bills
       of attainder, providing for impeachment of all civil officers, Jury
       trial in criminal cases, narrowing the definition of treason by
       direct action and two witnesses, and forbidding religious
       qualifications for national office.^[85]
   24. ^ In a republic, theory proposed that the people's agent
       (represented by the House of Representatives) would originate money
       bills. No money could be spent but by legislative appropriation.
       Military appropriations were limited to two-years duration. There
       could be no dual office-holding in the national government and no
       titles of nobility.^[85]
   25. ^ The Articles prohibited each state from treating with foreign
       governments, exchanging ambassadors, grant titles of nobility,
       maintaining their own armies or ships of war or privateers, they
       were not to engage in war unless invaded, lay taxes on imports. The
       states under the Articles of Confederation were not to make
       treaties among themselves.^[86]
   26. ^ This was necessary since Blackstone held the British Parliament
       was restrained from ex post facto laws only in criminal
       matters.^[87]
   27. ^ But because the 18th Century Founders did not choose universal
       suffrage for representatives or for direct proposition referendums
       does not mean that they did not have to argue the point down and
       outvote their opponents. In a letter to James Sullivan, May 26,
       1776, John Adams asked rhetorically, "Shall we say, that every
       member of the community, old and young, male and female, as well as
       rich and poor, must consent, expressly, to every act of
       legislation?" His answer was, for 1776, No.^[92]
   28. ^ This point was the principal reason for Maryland's reluctance to
       ratify the Articles in the first place, delaying its unanimous
       adoption from 1777 to 1783. Luther Martin (MD) stopped any
       spontaneously arising western claim of independent statehood by
       ensuring that the United States owned all the backlands ceded by
       the states.^[99]
   29. ^ Federalists ruled the first twelve years of government with a
       President by Washington and Adams. The Democratic-Republicans ruled
       for the next twenty-four, and arguably after one-term John Quincy
       Adams, for another thirty years under the Jacksonian Democrats.
   30. ^ Connecticut expanded electorate to add all town meeting
       voters;^[106] Massachusetts dropped property requirements;^[107]
       New Hampshire dropped some property requirements, and added town
       delegates;^[108] Rhode Island put the question to a referendum
       which rejected the ratification convention, the Federalist minority
       centered in Newport and Providence boycotted the election;^[109]
       Virginia dropped "legal and Constitutional requirements" to expand
       the freehold electorate;^[110] New York dropped property
       requirements, timed assembly elections at the same time, and
       allowed up to five sequential days of voting until the voting rolls
       were "complete".^[111]
   31. ^ Opposition to ratification was led by Governor George Clinton;
       the opposition also suggested that New York reserve the right to
       withdraw if the Constitution were not amended. Madison led the
       first session of the first Congress to propose amendments, and ten
       of the twelve were made Constitutional.
