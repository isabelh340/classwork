   Main article: List of public policy topics by country § United States

   The policies of the United States The Almanac of Policy Issues, which
   provides background information, archived documents, and links to major
   U.S. public policy issues, organized the public policy of the United
   States into nine categories. The following lists these categories
   followed by a few examples of specific, respective policies:
     * Criminal Justice: death penalty,^[1] drug policy,^[2] and gun
       control^[3]

     * Health: health insurance^[14] and Medicare^[15]
     * Social Welfare: social security^[16] and welfare^[17]
     * Foreign Affairs and National Security: defense spending.^[18]

Agricultural policy[edit]

   Agricultural policy of the United States is the governing policy for
   agriculture in the United States and is composed primarily of the
   periodically renewed federal U.S. farm bills.

   In "A New Agricultural Policy for the United States," authors Dennis
   Keeney and Long Kemp summarize the agricultural policy of the United
   States as follows: "Because of its unique geography, weather, history
   and policies, the United States has an agriculture that has been
   dominated by production of commodity crops for use in animal,
   industrial and export enterprises. Over time agricultural policies
   evolved to support an industrialized, commodity-based agriculture. This
   evolution resulted in farmers leaving the land with agriculture moving
   to an industrial structure."^[19]

Drug policy[edit]

   The drug policy of the United States is established by The Office of
   National Drug Control Policy, a former cabinet-level^[20] component of
   the Executive Office of the President of the United States, which was
   established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Its stated goal is to
   establish policies, priorities, and objectives to eradicate illicit
   drug use, drug manufacturing, and trafficking, drug-related crime and
   violence, and drug-related health consequences in the U.S.

   The Office of National Drug Control Policy's two current specific goals
   are to "curtail illicit drug consumption in America" and to "improve
   the public health and public safety of the American people by reducing
   the consequences of drug abuse."^[21] They plan to achieve these goals
   by taking the following actions:
     * Strengthen efforts to prevent drug use in communities
     * Seek early intervention opportunities in health care
     * Integrate treatment for substance use disorders into health care,
       and expand support for recovery
     * Break the cycle of drug use, crime, delinquency, and incarceration
     * Disrupt domestic drug trafficking and production
     * Strengthen international partnerships
     * Improve information systems for analysis, assessment, and local
       management^[21]

   The energy policy of the United States addresses issues of energy
   production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and
   gas mileage standards. The United States Department of Energy plays a
   major role, and its mission is "to ensure America's security and
   prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental, and nuclear
   challenges through transformative science and technology solutions."

   Moreover, the White House provides a summary of the United States'
   current condition regarding its energy policy: "For decades it has been
   clear that the way Americans produce and consume energy is not
   sustainable. Our addiction to foreign oil and fossil fuels puts our
   economy, our national security and our environment at risk. To take
   this country in a new direction, the President is working with Congress
   to pass comprehensive energy and climate legislation to protect our
   nation from the serious economic and strategic risks associated with
   our reliance on foreign oil, to create jobs, and to cut down on the
   carbon pollution that contributes to the destabilizing effects of
   climate change."

   The following is a snapshot of the United States' current energy policy
   goals:
     * Clean Energy Economy: make the investments in clean energy sources
       that will put Americans back in control of our energy future,
       create millions of new jobs and lay the foundation for long-term
       economic security. This will be accomplished by taking the
       following actions:
          + Initiating recovery act investments in clean energy
          + Applying more strident appliance efficiency standards
          + Leading the way in sustainability
          + Creating efficiency standards for cars and trucks
          + Making homes more energy efficient

       by taking the following actions:
          + Protecting our oceans

          + Great Lakes restoration
          + Limiting mercury emissions
          + Reducing the environmental impact of mountaintop coal mining
          + Reinvigorate the National Environmental Policy Act

       charge to reduce the dangerous pollution that causes global
       warming, and to make the investments in the clean energy technology
       that will power sustainable growth in the future. The following are
       actions that will be taken to accomplish climate change goals:
          + Providing international leadership
          + Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions

Policy responses to the late-2000s recession[edit]

   Main article: United States policy responses to the Great Recession

   The Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Securities and Exchange Commission
   took several steps on September 19 to intervene in the crisis. To stop
   the potential run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury also
   announced on September 19 a new $50 billion program to insure the
   investments, similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
   (FDIC) program.^[22] Part of the announcements included temporary
   exceptions to section 23A and 23B (Regulation W), allowing financial
   groups to more easily share funds within their group. The exceptions
   would expire on January 30, 2009, unless extended by the Federal
   Reserve Board.^[23] The Securities and Exchange Commission announced
   termination of short-selling of 799 financial stocks, as well as action
   against naked short selling, as part of its reaction to the mortgage
   crisis.^[24]
