   The Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States
   Constitution prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a
   citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or
   previous condition of servitude". It was ratified on February 3, 1870,
   as the third and last of the Reconstruction Amendments.

   In the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era
   that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of the millions
   of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish
   slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws,
   but the narrow election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868
   convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of
   black voters was important for the party's future. After rejecting more
   sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a
   compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of
   race, color, or previous servitude on February 26, 1869. The amendment
   survived a difficult ratification fight and was adopted on March 30,
   1870.

   United States Supreme Court decisions in the late nineteenth century
   interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, most black
   voters in the South were effectively disfranchised by new constitutions
   and laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory
   literacy tests, from which white voters were exempted by grandfather
   clauses. A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by
   white groups also suppressed black participation.

   In the twentieth century, the Court began to interpret the amendment
   more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in Guinn v. United
   States (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the "Texas
   primary cases" (1927–1953). Along with later measures such as the
   Twenty-fourth Amendment, which forbade poll taxes in federal elections,
   and Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966), which forbade
   poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased
   black participation in the American political system. Most important
   was the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided for federal oversight
   and enforcement of constitutional rights in areas with historic
   under-representation.

Text[edit]

   The Fifteenth Amendment in the National Archives

                Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to
                vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States
                or by any State on account of race, color, or previous
                condition of servitude.

                Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this
                article by appropriate legislation.^[1]

Background[edit]

   In the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era
   that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former
   slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865
   Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished
   slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress,
   however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create
   in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated
   Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be
   now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous
   Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern states would dramatically
   increase their power in the population-based House of
   Representatives.^[2]^[3] Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by
   attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black
   population.^[2]^[4]^[5]

   In 1865, Congress passed what would become the Civil Rights Act of
   1866, guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or
   previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also
   guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on
   the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black
   Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former
   condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing
   them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from
   owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in
   court.^[6] Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the
   bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto
   message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on
   the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in
   the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans
   and against whites.^[7]^[8] Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was
   overridden and the measure became law. This was the first time in
   American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary
   to override a presidential veto.^[9] Despite this victory, even some
   Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began
   to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those
   goals into laws.^[10]^[11] The experience encouraged both radical and
   moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black
   rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.^[12]

   On June 18, 1866, Congress adopted the Fourteenth Amendment, which
   guaranteed citizenship and equal protection under the laws regardless
   of race, and sent it to the states for ratification. After a bitter
   struggle that included attempted rescissions of ratification by two
   states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.^[13]

   The final decision of Congress not to include anything relating to the
   right to vote in the Fourteenth Amendment, aside from a clause in
   Section 2 warning states that did disfranchise citizens on the basis of
   race could be penalized by having the size of their Congressional
   delegation reduced, signaled to the states that they still possessed
   the right to deny ballot access to blacks.^[14] Northern states were
   generally as adverse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern
   states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states
   allowed blacks to vote.^[15] In the South, blacks were able to vote in
   many areas, but only through the intervention of the occupying Union
   Army.^[16]

Proposal and ratification[edit]

Proposal[edit]

   An 1867 drawing depicting African Americans casting ballots

   Anticipating an increase in Democratic membership in the following
   Congress, Republicans used the lame-duck session of the 40th United
   States Congress to pass an amendment protecting black suffrage.^[17]
   Representative John Bingham, the primary author of the Fourteenth
   Amendment, pushed for a wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations, but a
   broader proposal banning voter restriction on the basis of "race,
   color, nativity, property, education, or religious beliefs" was
   rejected.^[18] A proposal to specifically ban literacy tests was also
   rejected.^[17] Some Representatives from the North, where nativism was
   a major force, wished to preserve restrictions denying the franchise to
   foreign-born citizens, as did Representatives from the West, where
   ethnic Chinese were banned from voting.^[18] Both Southern and Northern
   Republicans also wanted to continue to deny the vote temporarily to
   Southerners disfranchised for support of the Confederacy, and they were
   concerned that a sweeping endorsement of suffrage would enfranchise
   this group.^[19]

   A House and Senate conference committee proposed the amendment's final
   text, which banned voter restriction only on the basis of "race, color,
   or previous condition of servitude".^[1] To attract the broadest
   possible base of support, the amendment made no mention of poll taxes
   or other measures to block voting, and did not guarantee the right of
   blacks to hold office.^[20] This compromise proposal was approved by
   the House on February 25, 1869, and the Senate the following
   day.^[21]^[22]

   The vote in the House was 144 to 44, with 35 not voting. The House vote
   was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats supporting the
   bill and only 3 Republicans voting against it.^[23] The House of
   Representatives passed the amendment with 143 Republican & 1
   Conservative Republican votes of "Yea", 39 Democrat, 3 Republican, 1
   Independent Republican & 1 Conservative votes of "Nay" and with 26
   Republican, 8 Democrat & 1 Independent Republican not voting.^[24] The
   final vote in the Senate was 39 to 13, with 14 not voting.^[25] The
   Senate passed the amendment with a vote of 39 Republican votes of
   "Yea", 8 Democrat & 5 Republican votes of "Nay" and with 13 Republican
   & 1 Democrat not voting.^[26] Some Radicals, such as Massachusetts
   Senator Charles Sumner, abstained from voting because the amendment did
   not prohibit literacy tests and poll taxes.^[27] Following
   congressional approval the proposed amendment was then sent by
   Secretary of State William Henry Seward to the states for ratification
   or rejection.^[22]

Ratification[edit]

   Though many of the original proposals for the amendment had been
   moderated by negotiations in committee, the final draft nonetheless
   faced significant hurdles in being ratified by three-fourths of the
   states. Historian William Gillette wrote of the process, "it was hard
   going and the outcome was uncertain until the very end."^[17]

   One source of opposition to the proposed amendment was the women's
   suffrage movement, which before and during the Civil War had made
   common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, with the passage
   of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male
   citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of
   women divorced from those of blacks.^[14] Matters came to a head with
   the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race
   discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an
   acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's
   leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the
   National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
   Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman
   Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who
   supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.^[28]

   February 1870, and the post Civil War political empowerment of African
   Americans.

   Nevada was the first state to ratify the amendment, on March 1,
   1869.^[22] The New England states and most Midwest states also ratified
   the amendment soon after its proposal.^[17] Southern states still
   controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North
   Carolina, also swiftly ratified.^[21] Newly elected U.S. President
   Ulysses S. Grant (a Republican) strongly endorsed the amendment,
   calling it "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of
   the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present
   day." He privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special
   legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's
   ratification.^[17] In April and December 1869, Congress passed
   Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and
   Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining
   congressional representation; all four states did so.^[22] The struggle
   for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which
   voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively.^[17]^[22]
   New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, tried to revoke its
   ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia,
   Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total
   ratifying states to twenty-nine—one more than the required twenty-eight
   ratifications from the thirty-seven states, and forestalling any court
   challenge to New York's resolution to withdraw its consent.^[22]

   The first twenty-eight states to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment
   were:^[29]
     * Nevada — March 1, 1869
     * West Virginia — March 3, 1869
     * North Carolina — March 5, 1869
     * Illinois — March 5, 1869
     * Louisiana — March 5, 1869
     * Michigan — March 8, 1869
     * Wisconsin — March 9, 1869
     * Maine — March 11, 1869
     * Massachusetts — March 12, 1869
     * Arkansas — March 15, 1869
     * South Carolina — March 15, 1869
     * Pennsylvania — March 25, 1869
     * New York — April 14, 1869 (Rescinded ratification – January 5,
       1870; re-ratified – March 30, 1970)
     * Indiana — May 14, 1869
     * Connecticut — May 19, 1869
     * Florida — June 14, 1869
     * New Hampshire — July 1, 1869
     * Virginia — October 8, 1869
     * Vermont — October 20, 1869
     * Alabama — November 16, 1869
     * Missouri — January 10, 1870
     * Minnesota — January 13, 1870
     * Mississippi — January 17, 1870
     * Rhode Island — January 18, 1870
     * Kansas — January 19, 1870
     * Ohio — January 27, 1870 (After rejection – April 1/30, 1869)
     * Georgia — February 2, 1870
     * Iowa — February 3, 1870

   Secretary of State Hamilton Fish certified the amendment on March 30,
   1870.^[22]^[30] New York, despite rescinding its ratification, was
   included as a ratifying state, as were:
     * Nebraska — February 17, 1870
     * Texas — February 18, 1870

   The remaining seven states all subsequently ratified the
   amendment:^[31]
     * New Jersey — February 15, 1871 (After rejection – March 17/18,
       1870)
     * Delaware — February 12, 1901 (After rejection – March 17/18, 1869)
     * Oregon — February 24, 1959 (After rejection – October 26, 1870)
     * California — April 3, 1962 (After rejection – January 28, 1870)
     * Maryland — May 7, 1973 (After rejection – February 4/26, 1870)
     * Kentucky — March 18, 1976 (After rejection – March 11/12, 1869)
     * Tennessee — April 8, 1997 (After rejection – November 16, 1869)

   The amendment's adoption was met with widespread celebrations in black
   communities and abolitionist societies; many of the latter disbanded,
   feeling that black rights had been secured and their work was complete.
   President Grant said of the amendment that it "completes the greatest
   civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred
   since the nation came to life".^[17] Many Republicans felt that with
   the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal
   protection; congressman and future president James A. Garfield stated
   that the amendment's passage "confers upon the African race the care of
   its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands."^[20]
   Congressman John R. Lynch later wrote that ratification of those two
   amendments made Reconstruction a success.^[32]

Application[edit]

Reconstruction[edit]

   The first known black voter after the amendment's adoption was Thomas
   Mundy Peterson, who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870 in the Perth
   Amboy, New Jersey mayoral election.^[33]

   In United States v. Reese (1876),^[34] the first U.S. Supreme Court
   decision interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court interpreted
   the amendment narrowly, upholding ostensibly race-neutral limitations
   on suffrage including poll taxes, literacy tests, and a grandfather
   clause that exempted citizens from other voting requirements if their
   grandfathers had been registered voters, a condition only whites could
   generally meet.^[35]^[36] The Court also stated that the amendment does
   not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United
   States with the right of exemption from discrimination in the exercise
   of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous
   condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by
   "appropriate legislation."^[37] The Court wrote:

     The Fifteenth Amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon
     any one. It prevents the States, or the United States, however, from
     giving preference, in this particular, to one citizen of the United
     States over another on account of race, color, or previous condition
     of servitude. Before its adoption, this could be done. It was as
     much within the power of a State to exclude citizens of the United
     States from voting on account of race, &c., as it was on account of
     age, property, or education. Now it is not. If citizens of one race
     having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of
     another having the same qualifications must be. Previous to this
     amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this
     discrimination: now there is. It follows that the amendment has
     invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional
     right which is within the protecting power of Congress. That right
     is exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective
     franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of
     servitude. This, under the express provisions of the second section
     of the amendment, Congress may enforce by "appropriate
     legislation."^[37]

   White supremacists such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) used paramilitary
   violence to prevent black people from voting. A number of blacks were
   killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their
   right to vote. The Enforcement Acts were passed by Congress in
   1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who
   violated the amendment.^[38] However, as Reconstruction neared its end
   and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts
   dropped significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the
   Supreme Court ruled that the federal government did not have the
   authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because
   they were not state actors.^[39]^[40]
   Voter registration card, Alamance County, North Carolina, 1902, with
   statement from registrant of birth before January 1, 1867, when the
   Fifteenth Amendment became law

   Congress removed a provision against conspiracy from the acts in 1894,
   weakening them further.^[40] In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes
   was elected president after tightly contested electoral college battle,
   receiving support from three Southern states in exchange for a pledge
   to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal
   interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights
   protections,^[41] allowing states to begin to implement racially
   discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

Post-reconstruction[edit]

   From 1890 to 1910, poll taxes and literacy tests were instituted across
   the South, effectively disenfranchising the great majority of blacks.
   White-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of
   blacks in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles,
   blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent
   reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by
   the Ku Klux Klan.^[35]

   In the 20th century, the Court began to read the Fifteenth Amendment
   more broadly.^[40] In Guinn v. United States (1915),^[42] a unanimous
   Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively
   exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be
   discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case Myers v. Anderson
   (1915), that the officials who enforced such a clause were liable for
   civil damages.^[43]^[44]

   The Court addressed the white primary system in a series of decisions
   later known as the "Texas primary cases". In Nixon v. Herndon
   (1927),^[45] Nixon sued for damages under federal civil rights laws
   after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on
   the basis of race. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the
   Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law,
   while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim.^[46] After Texas
   amended its statute to allow the political party's state executive
   committee to set voting qualifications, Nixon sued again; in Nixon v.
   Condon (1932),^[47] the Court again found in his favor on the basis of
   the Fourteenth Amendment.^[48]

   Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a
   rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court
   unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend
   (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization
   from that of the state in the previous primary cases.^[49]^[50]
   However, in United States v. Classic (1941),^[51] the Court ruled that
   primary elections were an essential part of the electoral process,
   undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in
   Smith v. Allwright (1944),^[52] overruled Grovey, ruling that denying
   non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the
   Fifteenth Amendment.^[53] In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry
   v. Adams (1953),^[54] the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were
   entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary
   elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.^[55]
   President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act of 1965

   The Court also used the amendment to strike down a gerrymander in
   Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960).^[56] The decision found that the
   redrawing of city limits by Tuskegee, Alabama officials to exclude the
   mostly black area around the Tuskegee Institute discriminated on the
   basis of race.^[40]^[57] The Court later relied on this decision in
   Rice v. Cayetano (2000),^[58] which struck down ancestry-based voting
   in elections for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs; the ruling held that
   the elections violated the Fifteenth Amendment by using "ancestry as a
   racial definition and for a racial purpose".^[59]

   After judicial enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather
   clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern
   black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent
   in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960.^[40] Although the Fifteenth
   Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the
   Twenty-fourth Amendment was adopted banning poll taxes in federal
   elections, and in 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in Harper v. Virginia
   State Board of Elections (1966)^[60] that state poll taxes violate the
   Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.^[61]^[62]

   Under its authority pursuant to Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment,
   Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to achieve further racial
   equality in voting. Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act required
   states and local governments with histories of racial discrimination in
   voting to submit all changes to their voting laws or practices to the
   federal government for approval before they could take affect, a
   process called "preclearance." By 1976, sixty-three percent of Southern
   blacks were registered to vote, only five percent less than Southern
   whites.^[40]

   The Supreme Court originally upheld these provisions as constitutional
   in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). However, in Shelby County v.
   Holder (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting
   Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined
   which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer
   constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under
   Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the
   Fifteenth Amendment "commands that the right to vote shall not be
   denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress
   the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to
   punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future."^[63]
   According to the Court, "Regardless of how to look at the record no one
   can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the ‘pervasive,’
   ‘flagrant, ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that faced
   Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered
   jurisdictions from the rest of the nation." While the preclearance
   provision itself was not struck down, it will continue to be inoperable
   unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.^[63]^[64]
