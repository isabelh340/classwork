   Social class in the United States is a controversial issue, having many
   competing definitions, models, and even disagreements over its very
   existence.^[1] Many Americans believe in a simple three-class model
   that includes the "rich", the "middle class", and the "poor". More
   complex models that have been proposed describe as many as a dozen
   class levels;^[2]^[3] while still others deny the very existence, in
   the European sense, of "social class" in American society.^[4] Most
   definitions of class structure group people according to wealth,
   income, education, type of occupation, and membership in a specific
   subculture or social network.

   Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, and James
   Henslin have proposed class systems with six distinct social classes.
   These class models feature an upper or capitalist class consisting of
   the rich and powerful, an upper middle class consisting of highly
   educated and affluent professionals, a middle class consisting of
   college-educated individuals employed in white-collar industries, a
   lower middle class composed of semi-professionals with typically some
   college education, a working class constituted by clerical and blue
   collar workers whose work is highly routinized, and a lower class
   divided between the working poor and the unemployed
   underclass.^[2]^[5]^[6]

   Class in the United States, featuring occupational descriptions by
   Thompson & Hickey as well as United States Census Bureau data
   pertaining to personal income and educational attainment for those age
   25 or older.

   Some definitions of class look only at numerical measures such as
   wealth or income. Others take into account qualitative factors, such as
   education, culture, and social status. There is no consensus on which
   of these variables is essential and which are merely common correlates.
   It is also disputed whether sharp lines can be drawn; one point of view
   in the debate:

     A stratified society is one marked by inequality, by differences
     among people that are regarded as being higher or lower…it is
     logically possible for a society to be stratified in a continuous
     gradation between high and low without any sharp lines…in
     reality…there is only a limited number of types of
     occupations…People in similar positions…grow similar in their
     thinking and lifestyle…they form a pattern, and this pattern creates
     social class.

   —Dennis Gilbert, The American Class Structure, 1998^[2]

Social status[edit]

  “ It is impossible to understand people's behavior…without the concept
    of social stratification, because class position has a pervasive
    influence on almost everything…the clothes we wear…the television shows
    we watch…the colors we paint our homes in and the names we give our
    pets…Our position in the social hierarchy affects our health,
    happiness, and even how long we will live.                                 ”

  —William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, Society in Focus, 2005^[5]

   Social class is sometimes presented as a description of how members of
   the society have sorted themselves along a continuum of positions
   varying in importance, influence, prestige, and compensation. In these
   models, certain occupations are considered to be desirable and
   influential, while others are considered to be menial, repetitive, and
   unpleasant. (In some cases, non-occupational roles such as a parent or
   volunteer mentor, are also considered.^[5]) Generally, the higher the
   ranking on such a scale, the higher the skill and education levels
   required to perform it.

   Some sociologists consider the higher income and prestige of higher
   ranked jobs to simply be incentives to encourage members of society to
   obtain the skills necessary to perform important work.^[7] This is an
   important mechanism in the economic theory of capitalism, and is
   compatible with the notion that class is mutable and determined by a
   combination of choices and opportunities.

   In other cases, class or status is inherited. For example, being the
   son or daughter of a wealthy individual, may carry a higher status and
   different cultural connotations than being a member of nouveau riche
   ("new money"). Those taking the functionalist approach to sociology and
   economics view social classes as components essential for the survival
   of complex societies such as American society.^[5]

   Income in the United States is most commonly measured by United States
   Census Bureau in terms of either household or individual and remains
   one of the most prominent indicators of class status. As 82% of all
   households, 16% of those in the top quintiles, had two income earners
   the discrepancy between household and personal income is quite
   considerable. In 2005 the top 95% of income earners made $12,500 or
   more, while 18% of households had incomes over $100,000. Personal
   income is largely the result of scarcity. As individuals who hold
   higher status positions tend to possess rare skills or assume positions
   society deems very essential, have higher incomes.^[citation needed]
   Overall the median household income was $46,326 in 2005^[8] while the
   median personal income (including only those above the age of 25) was
   $32,140.^[9]

   Per capita household income, the income a household is able to allocate
   to each member of the household is also an important variable in
   determining a given household's standard of living. A high household
   income may be offset by a large household size; thus, resulting in a
   low per capita household income.^[2] In 2005, the median household
   income per capita was $24,672.^[8]
   “ It should be stressed…that a position does not bring power and
     prestige because it draws a high income. Rather, it draws a high income
     because it is functionally important and the available personnel are
     for one reason or another scarce. It is therefore superficial and
     erroneous to regard high income as the cause of a man's power and
     prestige, just as it is erroneous to think that a man's fever is the
     cause of his disease…The economic source of power and prestige is not
     income primarily, but the ownership of capital goods (including
     patents, good will, and professional reputation). Such ownership should
     be distinguished from the possession of consumers' goods, which is an
     index rather than a cause of social standing.                          ”

   —Kingsley Davis and Wilbert E. Moore, Principles of Stratification

   As mentioned above, income is one of the most prominent features of
   social class; it is not one of its causes. In other words, income does
   not determine the status of an individual or household but rather
   reflects on that status. Some say that income and prestige are the
   incentives provided by society in order to fill needed positions with
   the most qualified and motivated personnel possible.^[7] However such a
   conclusion is contrary to the widespread observation ^[clarification
   needed antecdotal] that upper management at many companies is less
   knowledgeable and competent than many of their underlings, and that
   their positions are largely the result of fortuitous birth situations
   and networking. This situation is lampooned in the popular social
   commentary comic strip "Dilbert".

   The New York Times has used income quintiles to define class. It has
   assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class, lower
   middle class, middle class, upper middle class, and upper class.^[10]
   These definitions equate class with income, permitting people to move
   from class to class as their income changes.

Dual income controversy[edit]

   Percentage of 2+ income households in each of the quintiles (1/5 of the
   population).^[11]

   Income is one of the most commonly used attributes of a household to
   determine its class status. The relationship between income, which
   mostly arises from the scarcity of a certain skill, may however, prove
   to be more complex than initially perceived.^[7] While the idea is that
   income reflects status, household income may just be the product of two
   or more incomes.

   In 2005, 22% of American households had two income earners. The vast
   majority (97%) of households in the top quintile had two or more income
   earners. This means that the majority of household income in the top
   quintile are the result of two income earners pooling their resources,
   establishing a close link between perceived affluence and the number of
   income earners in a given household.^[6]^[11] This raises the question
   of whether or not the combination of incomes results in higher social
   status. Of course, there is no definite answer as class is a vague
   sociological concept.^[5]
   “ The parade of income earners with height representing income suggest
     that the relationship between the distribution of income and the class
     structure is…blurred in the middle…we saw dual-income working class
     marchers looking down on single-income upper-middle class marchers. In
     sum, the class structure as we have defined it…does not exactly match
     the distribution of household income.                                  ”

   —Dennis Gilbert, The American Class Structure, 1998^[2]

   Sociologist Dennis Gilbert states that it is possible for households to
   out-earn other households over higher class standing through increasing
   their number of income earners. He furthermore states that household
   size also played an essential role, as the standard of living for two
   persons living off one upper middle class personal income may very well
   be higher than that of a household with four members living off two
   working class personal incomes.^[2]

   The combination of two or more incomes, allow for households to
   increase their income substantially without moving higher on the
   occupational ladder or attaining higher educational degrees. Thus it is
   important to remember that the favorable economic position of
   households in the top two quintiles is in some cases the result of
   combined income, rather than demand for a single worker.^[11]

Education[edit]

   Main article: Educational attainment in the United States
   Educational attainment is related to both occupation, as seen above,
   and income. This graph shows the educational attainment of individuals
   age 25–64, employed full-time, by occupational field.^[12]

   Tertiary education (or "higher education") is required for many
   middle-class professions, depending on how the term middle class is to
   be defined. Tertiary education is rarely free, but the costs vary
   widely: tuition at elite private colleges often exceeds $200,000 for a
   four-year program, although financial aid may be significant. On the
   other hand, public colleges and universities typically charge much
   less, particularly for state residents.

   Also, scholarships offered by universities and government do exist, and
   low-interest loans are available. Still, the average cost of education,
   by all accounts, is increasing. The attainment of post-secondary and
   graduate degrees is the perhaps most important feature of a middle and
   upper middle class person with the university being regarded as the
   most essential institution and gatekeeper of the professional middle
   class.^[5]^[13] Educational attainment is also directly linked to
   income.

   In 2005, the vast majority of those with doctorate and professional
   degrees were among the nation's top 15% of income earners.^[14] Those
   with bachelor degrees had incomes considerably above the national
   median while the median income for those with some college education
   remained near the national median. According to United States Census
   Bureau, 9% of persons aged 25 or older had a graduate degree, 27.9% had
   a Bachelor's degree or more with 53% having attended college.^[14]^[15]

   With 85% of the population having graduated from high school, it
   becomes apparent that the average American does not have a college
   degree, but is likely to have attended college for some time and has
   graduated from high school. Overall, educational attainment serves as
   the perhaps most essential class feature of most Americans, being
   directly linked to income and occupation.^[16]

Culture[edit]

   See also: Working class in the United States

   Social classes feature their own sub-cultures and have therefore
   developed slightly different manners of socializing their
   offspring.^[5] Due to class mobility individuals may also acculturate
   to the culture of another class when ascending or descending in the
   social order. However, one does need to remember that all social
   classes in the United States, except the upper class, consist of tens
   of millions of people. Thus social classes form social groups so large
   that they feature considerable diversity within and any statement
   regarding a given social class' culture needs to be seen as a broad
   generalization.

   Since 1970, sociologists Paula LeMasters and Melvin Kohl have set out
   repeatedly to research class based cultures. Class culture has been
   shown to have a strong influence on the mundane lives of people,
   affecting everything from the manner in which they raise their
   children, initiation and maintenance of romantic relationship to the
   color in which they paint their houses.^[5] The strongest cultural
   differences seem to run along the professional middle class-working
   class divide.^[citation needed] A recent increase in residential class
   segregation and the overall tendency of individual to associate mostly
   with those of equal standing as themselves has further strengthened
   class differences.^[2]^[18]

   Parental views are perhaps the most essential factor in determining the
   socialization process which shapes new members of society.^[5] The
   values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related
   to the parent's occupational status.^[2] Parents from the professional
   class tend to raise their children to become curious independent
   thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a
   more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority.^[2]
   Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values
   while working class parents emphasize external values.^[2]

   Sociologist Dennis Gilbert uses a list of values identified by Melvin
   Kohn to be typical of the professional middle and working class. Middle
   class parents values for their children and themselves included:
   "Consideration of Others, Self-Control, Curiosity, Happiness, Honesty,
   Tolerance of Nonconformity, Open to Innovation…Self-Direction." This
   contrasted with surveyed working class individuals, who reported:
   "Manners, Obedience…Neatness, Cleanliness, Strong Punishment of Deviant
   Behavior, Stock to Old Ways, People not Trustworthy…Strict Leadership"
   as values for themselves and their children. There is a strong
   correlation between these values and the occupational activities of the
   respondents. The job characteristics of middle class respondents
   included: "Work Independently, Varied Tasks, Work with People or Data,"
   versus working class parents of reported "Close Supervision and
   Repetitive Work…"^[2]
   “ Not once in a professional middle-class home did I see a young boy
     shake his father's hand in a well-taught manly gesture…Not once did I
     hear a middle-class parent scornfully-or even sympathetically-call a
     crying boy a sissy or in any way reprimand him for his tears…even as
     young as six or seven, the working class boys seemed more emotionally
     controlled-more like miniature men-than those in the middle-class
     families.                                                              ”

   —Sociologist Lillian Rubin in Gilbert, 1998

   Gender roles are also viewed differently by those in the higher and
   lower social classes. Middle class individuals, who were more open
   towards "nonconformity" and emphasized individual self-direction as
   well as critical thinking, were also less stringent in their
   application of gender roles. Working class individuals, on the other
   hand, emphasized gender roles. While working-class people have more and
   more assimilated to middle class culture regarding their view and
   application of gender roles, differences remain. Professional class
   people are more likely to have an egalitarian distribution of work in
   their household with both spouses being equals in heterosexual
   marriages. According to Dennis Gilbert, "College life, generally a
   prologue to upper-middle class careers, delays marriage and encourages
   informal, relatively egalitarian association between men and
   women."^[2]^[6]

Upper class[edit]

   Further information: American upper class

   This term is applied to a wide array of elite groups existing in the
   United States of America. The term commonly includes the so-called
   "blue bloods" (multi-generational wealth combined with leadership of
   high society) such as the Astor or Roosevelt families. Twentieth
   century sociologist W. Lloyd Warner divided the upper class into two
   sections: the "upper-upper class" (or bourgeoisie) and "lower-upper
   class" (or "scoobs"). The former includes established upper-class
   families while the latter includes those with great wealth. As there is
   no defined lower threshold for the upper class it is difficult, if not
   outright impossible, to determine the exact number or percentage of
   American households that could be identified as being members of the
   upper-class(es).

   Income and wealth statistics may serve as a helpful guideline as they
   can be measured in a more objective manner. In 2005, approximately one
   and a half percent (1.5%) of households in the United States had
   incomes exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having incomes exceeding
   $157,000.^[19] Furthermore only 2.6% of households held assets
   (excluding home equity) of more than one-million dollars. One could
   therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent of
   American society are members of rich households. The richest 1% of the
   American population owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom
   90%,^[20] or perhaps even more.^[21]

   Members of the upper class control and own significant portions of
   corporate America and may exercise indirect power through the
   investment of capital. The high salaries and the potential for amassing
   great wealth through stock options have greatly increased the power and
   visibility of the "corporate elite". There is disagreement over whether
   the "nouveau riche" should be included as members of the upper class or
   whether this term should exclusively be used for established families.
   Many sociologists and commentators make a distinction between the upper
   class (in the sense of those in the families of inherited wealth) and
   the corporate elite. By implication, the upper class is held in lower
   regard (as inheritors of idle wealth) than the self-made millionaires
   in prestigious occupations.^[22]

Inherited wealth[edit]

   Yet another important feature of the upper class is that of inherited
   privilege. While most Americans, including those in the upper-middle
   class need to actively maintain their status, some upper class persons
   do not need to work in order to maintain their status. Status tends to
   be passed on from generation to generation without each generation
   having to re-certify its status.^[13] Overall, the upper class is
   financially the best compensated and one of the most influential
   socio-economic classes in American society.

Corporate elite[edit]

   The high salaries and, especially, the potential wealth through stock
   options, has supported the term corporate elite or corporate class. Top
   executives, including Chief Executive Officers, are among the
   financially best compensated occupations in the United States. The
   median annual earnings for a CEO in the United States were
   $140,350^[23] (exceeding the income of more than 90% of United States
   households). The Wall Street Journal reports the median compensation
   for CEOs of 350 major corporations was $6,000,000 in 2005 with most of
   the money coming from stock options.^[24]

   In New York City in 2005, the median income (including bonuses) of a
   corporate "chief operating officer" (the No. 2 job) was $377,000.^[25]
   The total compensation for a "top IT officer" in charge of information
   technology in New York City was $218,000.^[26] Thus even below the CEO
   level of top corporations, financial compensation will usually be
   sufficient to propel households with a mere one income earner in the
   top 1%. In 2005 only 1.5% of American households had incomes above
   $250,000 with many reaching this level only through having two income
   earners.^[19]^[27]^[28]
   “ Top executives are among the highest paid workers in the United
     States economy. However, salary levels vary substantially depending on
     the level of managerial responsibility; length of service; and type,
     size, and location of the firm. For example, a top manager in a very
     large corporation can earn significantly more than a counterpart in a
     small firm.

     Median annual earnings of general and operations managers in May 2004
     were $77,420. The middle 50% earned between $52,420 and $118,310.
     Because the specific responsibilities of general and operations
     managers vary significantly within industries, earnings also tend to
     vary considerably…the median annual earnings of chief executives in May
     2004 were $140,350; although chief executives in some industries earned
     considerably more…the median income of chief executive officers in the
     nonprofit sector was $88,006 in 2005, but some of the highest chief
     executives made more than $700,000.
                                                                              ”

   —United States Department of Labor,^[citation needed]

   Many politically powerful people make money before coming to office,
   but in general the political power elite have official incomes in the
   $150,000 to $185,000 range; members of Congress are paid $174,000, and
   are effectively required to have a residence in their district as well
   as one in Washington.^[29]

Upper middle[edit]

   Further information: American middle class § The
   Professional/Managerial middle class

   The upper middle class consists of highly educated salaried
   professionals whose work is largely self-directed. Many have advanced
   graduate degrees and household incomes commonly exceed the high
   five-figure range. Members of this class commonly value higher
   education – most holding advanced academic degrees – and are often
   involved with personal and professional networks including professional
   organizations. The upper middle class tends to have great influence
   over the course of society.^[2]

   Occupations which require high educational attainment are well
   compensated and are held in high public esteem. Physicians, lawyers,
   engineers, scientists and professors are largely considered to be upper
   middle class.^[13] The very well educated are seen as trendsetters; the
   anti-smoking, pro-fitness, and organic food movements, as well as
   environmentalism, are largely indigenous to this socio-economic
   grouping. Education serves as perhaps the most important value and also
   the most dominant entry barrier of the upper middle class.^[5]^[18]

   Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, Willam Thompson, and Joseph Hickey
   estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the
   population (or roughly three in every twenty persons). The hallmark of
   this class is its high educational attainment.

Middle class[edit]

   Main article: American middle class

   The middle class is perhaps the most vaguely defined of the social
   classes.^[3] The term can be used either to describe a relative elite
   of professionals and managers^[13] – also called the upper middle class
   – or it can be used to describe those in-between the extremes of
   wealth, disregarding considerable differences in income, culture,
   educational attainment, influence, and occupation.

   As with all social classes in the United States, there are no definite
   answers as to what is and what is not middle class. Sociologists such
   as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey
   have brought forth class models in which the middle class is divided
   into two sections that combined constitute 47% to 49% of the
   population. The upper middle or professional class constitutes the
   upper end of the middle class which consists of highly educated,
   well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end
   of the middle class – called either lower middle class or just middle
   class – consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and
   sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely
   supervised.^[2]^[5]^[6]
   “ Everyone wants to believe they are middle class. For people on the
     bottom and the top of the wage scale the phrase connotes a certain
     Regular Joe cachet. But this eagerness to be part of the group has led
     the definition to be stretched like a bungee cord.                    ”

   —Dante Chinni, the Christian Science Monitor, ^[30]

   Although income thresholds cannot be determined since social classes
   lack distinct boundaries and tend to overlap, sociologists and
   economists have put forward certain income figures they find indicative
   of middle class households. Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a
   husband making roughly $57,000 and a wife making roughly $40,000 with a
   household income of roughly $97,000 as a typical middle-class
   family.^[31]

   Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey identify household
   incomes between $35,000 and $75,000 as typical for the lower middle and
   $100,000 or more as typical for the upper middle class.^[5] Though it
   needs to be noted that household income distribution neither reflects
   standard of living nor class status with complete accuracy.^[2]

Traditional middle class[edit]

   Further information: Average Joe and American middle class §
   Statistical middle class
   Many primary and secondary level teachers in the United States are in
   the middle class.

   Those households more or less at the center of society may be referred
   to as being part of the American middle or middle-middle class in
   vernacular language use. In the academic models featured in this
   article, however, the middle class does not constitute a strong
   majority of the population. Those in the middle of the socio-economic
   strata—the proverbial Average Joe—are commonly in the area where the
   working and lower middle class overlap.

   The most prominent academic models split the middle class into two
   sections. Yet, it remains common for the term middle class to be
   applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio-economic
   strata. The middle class is then often sub-divided into an
   upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle class. In colloquial
   descriptions of the class system the middle-middle class may be
   described as consisting of those in the middle of the social strata.
   Politicians and television personalities such as Lou Dobbs can be seen
   using the term middle class in this manner, especially when discussing
   the middle-class squeeze.^[3]^[32] The wide discrepancy between the
   academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated
   professionals together in the same class with secretaries may lead to
   the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely
   ambiguous.^[2]

Lower middle class[edit]

   The lower middle class is, as the name implies, generally defined as
   those less privileged than the middle class. People in this class
   commonly work in supporting occupations. Although they seldom hold
   advanced academic degrees, a college degree (usually a bachelor's
   degree) is almost always required for entry into the lower middle
   class.

   Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey,
   however, only divide the middle class into two groups. In their class
   modes the middle class only consists of an upper and lower middle
   class. The upper middle class, as described above, constitutes roughly
   15% of the population with highly educated white collar professionals
   who commonly have salaries in the high 5-figure range and household
   incomes in the low six figure range. Semi-professionals with Bachelor's
   degrees and some college degrees constitute the lower middle class.
   Their class models show the lower middle class positioned slightly
   above the middle of the socio-economic strata. Those in blue- and
   pink-collar as well as clerical occupations are referred to as working
   class in these class models.^[2]^[5]

Working class[edit]

   The term working class applies to those that work at this tier in the
   social hierarchy. Definitions of this term vary greatly. While Lloyd
   Warner found the vast majority of the American population to be in
   either the upper-lower class or lower-lower class in 1949, modern-day
   experts such as Michael Zweig, an economist for SUNY–Stony Brook, argue
   that the working class constitutes most of the population.^[33]

   Dennis Gilbert places 13% of households among the "working poor" with
   12% being in the "underclass". Thompson & Hickey place roughly 17% to
   20% of households in the lower classes. The lower classes constituting
   roughly a fifth to a quarter of American society consists mainly of
   low-rung retail and service workers as well as the frequently
   unemployed and those not able to work.^[2]^[5]^[6] Overall, 13% of the
   population fall below the poverty threshold. Hunger and food insecurity
   were present in the lives of 3.9% of American households, while roughly
   twenty-five million Americans (ca. 9%) participated in the food stamp
   program.^[34]

Agriculture[edit]

   Further information: Agricultural history of the United States and
   Social class in American history

Farm workers[edit]

   Before industrialization, "yeoman farmers"—self-sufficient, politically
   independent landowners—made up a large portion of the country's
   population. Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy
   successfully expanded the political rights of the yeomen, and the
   geographical extent of the nation to provide them farms. This
   culminated in the Homestead Act of 1862 which provided hundreds of
   thousands of free farms. Before 1865 large southern plantations used
   slaves. After emancipation, a system of sharecropping and tenant
   farming for both whites and blacks in the South provided a
   semi-independent status for farmers who did not own their land. In
   contemporary times, migrant agricultural workers—mostly
   Mexicans—perform field and packing work.^[35]

Farmers[edit]

   Only 0.7% of the population of the United States is employed in the
   agricultural sector.^[36] Most are proprietors of independent farms.
   Once the dominant American social class, this group diminished in
   overall numbers during the 20th century, as farm holdings grew more
   consolidated, farming operations became more mechanized, and most of
   the population migrated to urban areas.^[2]

   Today, the agricultural sector has essentially taken on the
   characteristics of business and industry generally. In contemporary
   usage, a "farmer" is someone who owns and operates a farm, which more
   often than not will be a sizable business enterprise; "agricultural
   workers" or "farm workers", who perform the actual work associated with
   farming, typically come out of the lower classes; indeed, they are
   often near-destitute immigrants or migrant farm workers. In this
   respect, farming mirrors big business: like any enterprise, a farm has
   owners (who may be a family or a corporation), salaried managers,
   supervisors, foremen and workers.

   With the number of farms steadily diminishing, the stereotypical humble
   homestead is increasingly the exception, for viable farming now means
   agribusiness; the large amounts of capital required to operate a
   competitive farm require large-scale organization. The large landowners
   in California's Central Valley, Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley
   fall squarely within the upper class. Among farmers, "income" in the
   conventional sense is not an accurate standard of wealth measurement,
   because farmers typically keep their official income low by placing
   their assets into farming corporations rather than drawing the money
   directly. The stereotypical poor, marginal farmer "eking out a living"
   from the soil, an image deeply ingrained in most Americans' minds by
   folklore, films, and even history texts, has now been largely displaced
   by agribusiness, which has bought them out and consolidated their
   holdings.^[37]

Class mobility[edit]

   Class ascendancy—namely that each successive generation will have a
   higher standard of living than its predecessor—is a central theme in
   American literature and culture and plays a key role in the American
   dream. While social class in the United States is thought to be largely
   based on achievement, on a relative basis social mobility in the United
   States ranks below many other countries,^[38]^[39] and climbing the
   social ladder is more difficult for those born into less advantageous
   positions.^[5]^[13]^[40]

   Occupation (perhaps the most important class component), educational
   attainment, and income can be increased through a lifetime. However,
   factors such as wealth inheritance and local education system—which
   often provides lower quality education to those in poor school
   districts^[41]—may make rising out of poverty a challenge. Class
   mobility in the United States decreased between the 1970s and the
   1990s.^[42]

Class and health[edit]

   A homeless American citizen. (August 4, 2005)

   Income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher
   incomes had better access to health care facilities, higher life
   expectancy, lower infant mortality rate and increased health
   consciousness. While the United States lacks socialized medicine
   similar to that found in many other post-industrialized developed
   nations across Europe and Asia, 85% of the United States population
   were insured in 2005. Yet, discrepancies seem to remain beyond the
   difference between insured and uninsured. In 2006, Harvard researchers
   divided the United States into "eight Americas."^[43]

   Life expectancy ranges from 84.9 years for Asian Americans who had an
   average per capita income of $21,566, to 71.1 years for urban African
   Americans with an average per capita income of $14,800.^[43]

   Furthermore, like other post-industrial nations, the United States saw
   increased health consciousness among persons of higher social status.
   Persons of higher status are less likely to smoke, more likely to
   exercise regularly, and be more conscious of their diet.^[44]
   Additionally, poor Americans are more likely to consume lower quality,
   processed foods. One can therefore conclude that low socio-economic
   status contributes to a person's likelihood of being obese.^[45]^[46]

   States and Investment theory of politics
   A study by Larry Bartels found a positive correlation between Senate
   votes and opinions of high income people, conversely, low income people
   had a negative correlation with senate votes.^[47]

   Income remains one of the main indicators of class, as it commonly
   reflects educational attainment as well as occupation.^[7] A frequent
   distinction in political attitudes can be found among individuals
   residing in households with differing incomes.^[5] For example, during
   the 2000 election, voter turnout among those in the top 26% with
   household incomes exceeding $75,000 was 27% higher than the
   average.^[48]

Inequality and crisp definition of any existent class groupings[edit]

   Some academics consider American society sociologically and
   economically fragmented in such a manner that no clear class
   distinctions can be made. This means that there are no pronounced
   breaks in socioeconomic strata, which makes class division highly
   subjective and disputable.^[1] Others, such as sociologist Dennis
   Gilbert, dispute the concept of a well-mixed society, and claim that
   distinct social networks can be identified for each class. W. Lloyd
   Warner also asserts the existence of class markers:
   “ We are proud of those facts of American life that fit the pattern we
     are taught but somehow we are often ashamed of those equally important
     social facts which demonstrate the presence of social class.
     Consequently, we tend to deny them, or worse, denounce them and by
     doing so we tend to deny their existence and magically make them
     disappear from consciousness.                                         ”

   —W. Lloyd Warner, What Social Class Is In America^[4]

   Warner asserts that social class is as old as civilization itself and
   has been present in nearly every society from before the Roman Empire,
   through medieval times, and to the modern-day United States. He
   believes that complex societies such as the United States need an
   equally complex social hierarchy.^[4]

Social class in popular culture[edit]

   The existence of class differences in American society has long been
   the focus of popular culture, whether in the form of books, films, or
   plays. Social class, for example, is a theme used in the 1948
   production Mister Roberts (play), in a scene where the ship’s captain
   displays resentment toward the title character, contrasting his own
   impoverished background to that of Roberts himself:

          I think you’re a pretty smart boy. I may not talk very good,
          Mister, but I know how to take care of smart boys. Let me tell
          you something. Let me tell you a little secret. I hate your
          guts, you college son-of-a-bitch! You think you’re better than I
          am! You think you’re better because you’ve had everything handed
          to you. Let me tell you something, Mister – I’ve worked since I
          was ten years old, and all my life I’ve known you superior
          bastards. I knew you people when I was a kid in Boston and I
          worked in eating-places and you ordered me around … “Oh bus-boy!
          My friend here seems to have thrown up on the table. Clean it
          up, please!” I started going to sea as a steward and I worked
          for you then … “Steward, take my magazine out to the deck
          chair!” … “Steward, I don’t like your looks. Please keep out of
          my way as much as possible!” Well, I took that crap! I took that
          for years from pimple-faced bastards who weren’t good enough to
          wipe my nose! And now I don’t have to take it any more! There’s
          a war on, by God, and I’m the Captain and you can wipe my nose!
          The worst thing I can do to you is to keep you on this ship! And
          that‘s where you’re going to stay! Now get out of here.^[49]
