Geographic term[edit]

   Geographically, term includes the U.S. states and regions of the United
   States that are located across the northernmost part of the country. It
   includes, but is not limited to, states along the Canada–United States
   border.

Census Bureau[edit]

   The United States Census Bureau divides some of the northernmost United
   States into the Midwest Region and the Northeast Region.^[1] The Census
   Bureau also includes the northernmost states of the Northwestern United
   States, that are , within the West Region.^[1]

Historical term[edit]

   Before 19th century westward expansion, the "Northern United States"
   corresponded to the present day New England region. By the 1830s it
   corresponded to the present day Northeastern United States

American Civil War[edit]

   During the American Civil War, the Northern United States was composed
   of the U.S. states that remained in the United States of America, the
   Union states. In this context, "The North" is synonymous with the
   Union. In this context, "The South" is composed of the states that
   seceded from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America.

   However, which states comprised "The North" in this context can be the
   subject of historical disagreement. Some slave-holding states that
   remained in the Union, including Maryland below the Mason–Dixon line,
   may be excluded.^[2] Some of the Union states were not geographically
   located in the north, but may be included.
