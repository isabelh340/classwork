   In the United States, a county is a political and geographic
   subdivision of a state, usually assigned some governmental
   authority.^[1] The term "county" is used in 48 of the 50 U.S.
   states.^[1] The exceptions are Louisiana and Alaska, where the
   functionally equivalent subdivisions are called, respectively, parishes
   and boroughs. Numerous consolidated city–counties exist throughout the
   U.S. in which a city has merged with its county to form one unified
   jurisdiction with the governmental powers of both entities.

   The U.S. federal government uses the term "county equivalent" to
   describe administrative or statistical areas that are comparable to
   counties. Louisiana parishes; the organized boroughs of Alaska; the
   District of Columbia; and the independent cities of the states of
   Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada are equivalent to counties for
   administrative purposes. Alaska's Unorganized Borough is divided into
   11 census areas which are statistically equivalent to counties. As of
   2013, the United States has 3,007 counties and 137 county equivalents
   for a total of 3,144 counties and county equivalents.^[2]

   The number of counties per state ranges from the 3 counties of Delaware
   to the 254 counties of Texas.

   Counties still have significant governmental functions in all states
   except Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
   has removed most government functions from eight of its 14 counties.

History[edit]

   Counties were among the earliest units of local government established
   in the Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States. Virginia
   created the first counties in order to ease the administrative workload
   in Jamestown. The House of Burgesses divided the colony first into four
   "incorporations" in 1617 and finally into eight shires (or counties) in
   1634: James City, Henrico, Charles City, Charles River, Warrosquyoake,
   Accomac, Elizabeth City, and Warwick River.^[3] America's oldest intact
   county court records can be found at Eastville, Virginia, in
   Northampton (originally Accomac) County, dating to 1632.^[4] Maryland
   established its first county, St. Mary's, in 1637, and Massachusetts
   followed in 1643. Pennsylvania and New York delegated significant power
   and responsibility from state government to county governments, and
   thereby established a pattern for most of the United States, although
   counties remained relatively weak in New England.^[5]

   When independence came, "the framers of the Constitution did not
   provide for local governments. Rather, they left the matter to the
   states. Subsequently, early state constitutions generally
   conceptualized county government as an arm of the state." In the
   twentieth century, the role of local governments strengthened and
   "counties began providing an ever widening range of services".^[6]

   The newest county in the United States is the City and County of
   Broomfield, Colorado, established in 2001 as a consolidated
   city-county.^[7]^[8] The newest county-equivalents are the Alaskan
   boroughs of Skagway established in 2007, Wrangell established in 2008,
   and Petersburg established in 2013.^[9]

County variations[edit]

Consolidated city-counties[edit]

   Main article: Consolidated city-county

   A consolidated city-county is simultaneously a city, which is a
   municipal corporation (municipality), and a county, which is an
   administrative division of a state, having the powers and
   responsibilities of both types of entities. There are 40 consolidated
   city-counties in the U.S.,^[1] including Denver, Colorado;
   Indianapolis, Indiana; Jacksonville, Florida; Louisville, Kentucky;
   Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania; and San Francisco, California.

   Similarly, some of Alaska's boroughs have merged with their principal
   cities creating unified city-boroughs. Some such consolidations and
   mergers have created cities that rank among the geographically largest
   cities in the world, though often with population densities far below
   those of most urban areas.

County equivalents[edit]

   The term county equivalents is used to describe divisions whose
   organization differs from that of most counties:
     * Alaska census areas: Most of the land area of Alaska is not
       contained within any of Alaska's 19 organized boroughs. This vast
       area, larger than France and Germany combined, is officially
       referred to by the Alaska state government as the Unorganized
       Borough, and, outside of other incorporated borough limits, has no
       independent "county" government, although several incorporated city
       governments exist within its boundaries; the majority of it is
       governed and run by the State of Alaska as an extension of state
       government.^A[›] The United States Census Bureau, in cooperation
       with the Alaska state government for census and electoral
       districting purposes, has divided the Unorganized Borough into 11
       census areas for statistical purposes only.^B[›]
     * Independent cities: These are cities that legally belong to no
       county. They differ from consolidated city-counties—where a city
       and county have been merged into one unified jurisdiction. As of
       July 2013^[update], there are 41 such cities in the United States,
       including Baltimore, Maryland; Carson City, Nevada; St. Louis,
       Missouri; and all 38 cities in Virginia, where any area
       incorporated as a city is outside of the county
       jurisdiction.^[10]^[11]
     * Washington, D.C.,^[12] outside the jurisdiction of any state, has a
       special status. The city of Washington comprises the entirety of
       the District of Columbia, which, in accordance with Article 1,
       Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, is under the jurisdiction of
       the U.S. Congress. When founded, the District was in fact divided
       into two counties and two independent cities. Alexandria County
       (which now forms Arlington County and a portion of the independent
       city of Alexandria) was given back to Virginia in 1846, while the
       three remaining entities (the City of Washington, Georgetown City,
       and Washington County) were merged into a consolidated government
       by an act of Congress in 1871 and Georgetown was formally abolished
       as a city entity by another act in 1895.

   Consolidated city-counties are not designated county-equivalents for
   administrative purposes; since they maintain the responsibilities of
   both city and county government, in the context of administrative
   division, they are properly classified as counties in their own right.

Organization[edit]

   The site of a county's administration, and often the county courthouse,
   is called the county seat ("parish seat" or "borough seat" in Louisiana
   or Alaska). Several New England counties use the term "shire town" for
   the county seat.

   Many counties are divided into smaller political or governmental units.
   In Northeastern and Midwestern states, counties are divided into civil
   townships (or "towns" in New England, New York, and Wisconsin), which
   may provide governmental or public services.

County names[edit]

   See also: Lists of U.S. county name etymologies

   Common sources of county names are names of people, geographic
   features, places in other states or countries, Native American tribes,
   and animals. Quite a few counties bear names of French or Spanish
   origin.^[13]

   Counties are most often named for people, often political figures or
   early settlers, with over 2,100 of the 3,140 total so named. The most
   common county name, with 31, is Washington County, for America's first
   president, George Washington. Up until 1871, there was a Washington
   County within the District of Columbia, but it was dissolved by the
   District of Columbia Organic Act. Jefferson County, for Thomas
   Jefferson, is next with 27. The most recent president to have a county
   named for him was Warren G. Harding, reflecting the slowing rate of
   county creation since New Mexico and Arizona became states in 1912. The
   most common names for counties not named after presidents are Franklin
   (25), Clay (18), and Montgomery (18).

   After people, the next most common source of county names are
   geographic features and locations, with some counties even being named
   after counties in other states, or for places in countries such as the
   United Kingdom. The most common geographic county name is Lake. Native
   American tribes and animals lend their names to some counties. Quite a
   few counties bear names of French or Spanish origin, such as Marquette
   County being named after French missionary Father Jacques
   Marquette.^[13]

   The county's equivalent in the state of Louisiana, the parish (Fr.
   paroisse civile and Sp. parroquia) took its name during the state's
   French and Spanish colonial periods. Before the Louisiana Purchase and
   granting of statehood, government was often administered in towns where
   major church parishes were located. Of the original 19 civil parishes
   of Louisiana that date from statehood in 1807, nine were named after
   the Roman Catholic parishes from which they were governed.

County government[edit]

   The powers of counties arise from state law and vary widely.^[14] In
   Connecticut and Rhode Island,^[15]^[16] counties are geographic
   entities, but not governmental jurisdictions. At the other extreme,
   Maryland counties and the county-equivalent City of Baltimore handle
   almost all services, including public education, although the state
   retains an active oversight authority with many of these services.^[17]

   In most Midwestern and Northeastern states, counties are further
   subdivided into townships or towns, which sometimes exercise local
   powers or administration. Throughout the United States, counties may
   contain other independent, self-governing municipalities.

   Counties are usually governed by an elected County commission, Board of
   Supervisors, Commissioners' Court, County Council, Board of Chosen
   Freeholders, County Court, or County Legislature. In some counties,
   there is a county executive. In cases in which a Consolidated
   city-county or independent city exists, a City Council usually governs
   city/county or city affairs.

   In many states, the board in charge of a county holds powers that
   transcend all three traditional branches of government. It has the
   legislative power to enact ordinances for the county; it has the
   executive power to oversee the executive operations of county
   government; and it has quasi-judicial power with regard to certain
   limited matters (such as hearing appeals from the planning commission
   if one exists).

   The day-to-day operations of the county government are sometimes
   overseen by an elected county executive or by a chief administrative
   officer or county administrator who reports to the board, the mayor, or
   both.

   In many states, several important officials are elected separately from
   the board of commissioners or supervisors and cannot be fired by the
   board. These positions may include county clerk, county treasurer,
   county surrogate, district attorney, sheriff, and others.

Scope of power[edit]

   The power of county governments varies widely from state to state, as
   does the relationship between counties and incorporated cities. The
   government of the county usually resides in a municipality called the
   county seat. However, some counties may have multiple seats or no seat.
   In some small counties with no incorporated municipalities, a large
   settlement may serve as the county seat.

Minimal scope[edit]

   In New England, counties function at most as judicial court districts
   and sheriff's departments (presently, in Connecticut only as judicial
   court districts—and in Rhode Island, they have lost both those
   functions and all others), and most of the governmental authority below
   the state level is in the hands of towns and cities. In several of
   Maine's sparsely populated counties, small towns rely on the county for
   law enforcement, and in New Hampshire several social programs are
   administered at the state level. In some New England states, such as in
   Connecticut, parts of Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, counties are now
   only geographic designations, and they do not have any governmental
   powers. All government is either done at the state level or at the
   municipal level. In Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts, regional
   councils have been established to partially fill the void left behind
   by the abolished county governments.^[18] The regional councils'
   authority is limited compared with a county government—they have
   authority only over infrastructure and land use planning, distribution
   of state and federal funds for infrastructure projects, emergency
   preparedness, and limited law enforcement duties.

Moderate scope[edit]

   In the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, counties typically provide, at a
   minimum, courts, public utilities, libraries, hospitals, public health
   services, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails. There is usually a
   county registrar, recorder, or clerk (the exact title varies) who
   collects vital statistics, holds elections (sometimes in coordination
   with a separate elections office or commission), and prepares or
   processes certificates of births, deaths, marriages, and dissolutions
   (divorce decrees). The county recorder normally maintains the official
   record of all real estate transactions. Other key county officials
   include the coroner/medical examiner, treasurer, assessor, auditor,
   controller, and district attorney.

   In most states, the county sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer
   in the county. However, except in major emergencies where clear chains
   of command are essential, the county sheriff normally does not directly
   control the police departments of city governments, but merely
   cooperates with them (e.g., under mutual aid pacts). Thus, the most
   common interaction between county and city law enforcement personnel is
   when city police officers deliver suspects to sheriff's deputies for
   detention or incarceration in the county jail.

   In virtually all U.S. states, the state courts and local law
   enforcement are organized and implemented along county boundaries, but
   nearly all of the substantive and procedural law adjudicated in state
   trial courts originates from the state legislature and state appellate
   courts. In other words, most criminal defendants are prosecuted for
   violations of state law, not local ordinances, and if they, the
   district attorney, or police seek reforms to the criminal justice
   system, they will usually have to direct their efforts towards the
   state legislature rather than the county (which merely implements state
   law). A typical criminal defendant will be arraigned and subsequently
   indicted or held over for trial before a trial court in and for a
   particular county where the crime occurred, kept in the county jail (if
   he is not granted bail or cannot make bail), prosecuted by the county's
   district attorney, and tried before a jury selected from that county.
   But long-term incarceration is rarely a county responsibility,
   execution of capital punishment is never a county responsibility, and
   the state's responses to prisoners' appeals is the responsibility of
   the state attorney general, who has to defend before the state
   appellate courts the prosecutions conducted by locally-elected district
   attorneys in the name of the state. Furthermore, county-level trial
   court judges are officers of the judicial branch of the state
   government rather than county governments.

   In many states, the county controls all unincorporated lands within its
   boundaries. In states with a township tier, unincorporated land is
   controlled by the townships. Residents of unincorporated land who are
   dissatisfied with county-level or township-level resource allocation
   decisions can attempt to vote to incorporate as a city, town, or
   village.

   A few counties directly provide public transportation themselves,
   usually in the form of a simple bus system. However, in most counties,
   public transportation is provided by one of the following: a
   special-purpose district that is coterminous with the county (but
   exists separately from the county government), a multi-county regional
   transit authority, or a state agency.

Broad scope[edit]

   In western and southern states, more populated counties provide many
   facilities, such as airports, convention centers, museums, recreation
   centers, beaches, harbors, zoos, clinics, law libraries, and public
   housing. They provide services such as child and family services, elder
   services, mental health services, welfare services, veterans assistance
   services, animal control, probation supervision, historic preservation,
   food safety regulation, and environmental health services. They have
   many additional officials like public defenders, arts commissioners,
   human rights commissioners, and planning commissioners. Finally, there
   may also be a county fire department and even a county police
   department (as distinguished from fire and police departments operated
   by individual cities, special districts, or the state government). For
   example, Gwinnett County, Georgia, and its county seat, the city of
   Lawrenceville, each have their own police departments. (A separate
   county sheriff's department is responsible for security of the county
   courts and administration of the county jail.) In several southern
   states, public school systems are organized and administered at the
   county level.

Statistics[edit]

   As of 2013^[update], there were 3,007 counties, 64 parishes, 19
   organized boroughs, 11 census areas, 41 independent cities,^[19] and
   the District of Columbia for a total of 3,143 counties and
   county-equivalents in the United States.^[2] The average number of
   counties per state is 62, with a range from the three counties of
   Delaware to the 254 counties of Texas.

   Southern and Midwestern states generally tend to have more counties
   than Western or Northeastern states, as many Northeastern states are
   not large enough in area to warrant a large number of counties, and
   many Western states were sparsely populated when counties were created.
   The five counties of Rhode Island, the eight counties of Connecticut,
   and eight of the 14 counties of Massachusetts no longer have functional
   county governments, but continue to exist as legal and census entities.

Population[edit]

   Main article: List of United States counties and county-equivalents

   The average U.S. county population was nearly 100,000 in 2012. The most
   populous county is Los Angeles County, California, with 9,962,789
   residents in 2012. This number is greater than the populations of 42
   U.S. states, and even 800.000 larger than the population of the 10
   lowest states combined. It also makes Los Angeles County 17.7 times as
   large as the least populous state, Wyoming. The second most populous
   county is Cook County, Illinois with a 2010 census population of
   5,194,675.^[28] Cook County's population is larger than that of 29
   individual U.S. states and the combined populations of the seven
   smallest states.^[29]

   The least populous county is Loving County, Texas, with 71 residents in
   2012.

   The most densely populated county or county-equivalent is New York
   County, New York (coextensive with the New York City Borough of
   Manhattan), with 70,924 persons per square mile (27,384 km^2) in 2012.
   The Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska is both the most extensive and
   the least densely populated county or county-equivalent with 0.0397
   persons per square mile (0.0153 km^2) in 2012.

Area[edit]

   Main article: County statistics of the United States
   A highway sign designating the border between Nicholas and Greenbrier
   counties in West Virginia along a secondary road.

   At the 2000 U.S. Census, the median land area of U.S. counties was
   622 sq mi (1,610 km^2), which is two-thirds of the median land area of
   a ceremonial county of England, and a little more than a quarter of the
   median land area of a French département. Counties in the western
   United States typically have a much larger land area than those in the
   eastern United States. For example, the median land area of counties in
   Georgia is 343 sq mi (890 km^2), whereas in Utah it is 2,427 sq mi
   (6,290 km^2).

   The most extensive county or county-equivalent is the Yukon-Koyukuk
   Census Area, Alaska, with a land area of 145,505 square miles
   (376,856 km^2). All nine of the most extensive county-equivalents are
   in Alaska. The most extensive county is San Bernardino County,
   California, with a land area of 20,057 square miles (51,947 km^2). The
   least extensive county is Kalawao County, Hawaii, with a land area of
   11.991 square miles (31.058 km^2). The least extensive
   county-equivalent is the independent City of Falls Church, Virginia,
   with a land area of 1.999 square miles (5.177 km^2).^[1]

Geographic relationships between cities and counties[edit]

   In some states, a municipality may reside in only one county and may
   not annex territory in adjacent counties, but in the majority of
   states, the state constitution or state law allows municipalities to
   extend across county boundaries. At least 32 states include
   municipalities in multiple counties. Dallas and Oklahoma City, for
   example, both contain portions of five counties. New York City is an
   unusual case of a city in multiple counties. The city comprises five
   counties in their entirety, each coextensive with one of the five
   boroughs of the city: Manhattan (New York County), The Bronx (Bronx
   County), Queens (Queens County), Brooklyn (Kings County) and Staten
   Island (Richmond County).

Notes[edit]

   ^ A: The Unorganized Borough, Alaska formed by the Borough Act of 1961
   is a legal entity, run by the Alaska state government as an extension
   of State government,^[30] it and the independently incorporated
   Unified, Home Rule, First Class and Second Class boroughs roughly
   correspond to parishes in Louisiana and to counties in the other 48
   states.^[31]
   ^ B: These 11 statistical areas are used solely by the United States
   Census Bureau to tabulate population and other census statistics within
   the Unorganized Borough; they have no legal basis in Alaska state or
   federal law other than for electoral representation and federal
   financial assistance purposes.
