   Main article: Health care in the United States

   Health care reform in the United States has a long history. Reforms
   have often been proposed but have rarely been accomplished. In 2010,
   landmark reform was passed through two federal statutes enacted in
   2010: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed
   March 23, 2010,^[1]^[2] and the Health Care and Education
   Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872), which amended the PPACA and
   became law on March 30, 2010.^[3]^[4]

   Future reforms and ideas continue to be proposed, with notable
   arguments including a single-payer system and a reduction in
   fee-for-service medical care.^[5] The PPACA includes a new agency, the
   Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which is intended to
   research reform ideas through pilot projects.

History of national reform efforts[edit]

   Main article: History of health care reform in the United States

   Here is a summary of reform achievements at the national level in the
   United States. For failed efforts, State based efforts, native tribes
   services and more details generally, see the main article History of
   health care reform in the United States.
     * 1965 President Lyndon Johnson enacted legislation that introduced
       Medicare, covering both hospital and general medical insurance for
       senior citizens paid for by a Federal employment tax over the
       working life of the retiree, and Medicaid permitted the Federal
       government to partially fund a program for the poor, with the
       program managed and co-financed by the individual states.^[6]^[7]
     * 1985 The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
       (COBRA) amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
       (ERISA) to give some employees the ability to continue health
       insurance coverage after leaving employment.^[8]
     * 1996 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
       (HIPAA) not only protects health insurance coverage for workers and
       their families when they change or lose their jobs, it also made
       health insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions. If such
       condition had been diagnosed before purchasing insurance, insurance
       companies are required to cover it after patient has one year of
       continuous coverage. If such condition was already covered on their
       current policy, new insurance policies due to changing jobs, etc...
       have to cover the condition immediately.^[9]
     * 1997 The State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, was
       established by the federal government in 1997 to provide health
       insurance to children in families at or below 200 percent of the
       federal poverty line.^[10]
     * 2010 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as
       Obamacare, was enacted, providing for the phased introduction over
       four years of a comprehensive system of mandated health insurance
       with reforms designed to eliminate "some of the worst practices of
       the insurance companies"—pre-existing condition screening and
       premium loadings, policy cancellations on technicalities when
       illness seems imminent, annual and lifetime coverage caps. It also
       sets a minimum ratio of direct health care spending to premium
       income, and creates price competition bolstered by the creation of
       three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like-for-like
       comparisons by consumers, and a web-based health insurance exchange
       where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans. The system
       preserves private insurance and private health care providers and
       provides more subsidies to enable the poor to buy insurance.

Motivation[edit]

   Main article: Health care reform debate in the United States
   Medicare and Medicaid Spending as % GDP (data from the CBO)

   International comparisons of healthcare have found that the United
   States spends more per-capita than other similarly-developed nations
   but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting
   inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant
   underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its
   aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and
   Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor).
   The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform
   proposals.
   Health spending per capita, in US$ PPP-adjusted, compared amongst
   various first world nations.

   According to 2009 World Bank statistics, the U.S. had the highest
   healthcare costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the
   world, even though estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 15.6%
   of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) lacked
   insurance.^[11] In March 2010, billionaire Warren Buffett commented
   that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees’ health
   care put them at a competitive disadvantage.^[12]
   Life expectancy compared to healthcare spending from 1970 to 2008, in
   the US and the next 19 most wealthy countries by total GDP.^[13]

   Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement
   age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare
   costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and
   federal governments, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid
   spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor).^[14]
   Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government
   is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.^[15]

Insurance cost and availability[edit]

   In addition, the number of employers who offer health insurance has
   declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from
   2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages
   rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family
   Foundation.^[16] Even for those who are employed, the private insurance
   in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth
   Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults
   were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more
   likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report
   financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps
   for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that
   underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes —
   73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes
   below 200% of the federal poverty level.^[17] However, a study
   published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the
   typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in
   2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees
   Health Benefits Program Standard Option.^[18] One indicator of the
   consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study
   in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcys
   involved medical bills,^[19] although other sources dispute this.^[20]

   There are health losses from insufficient health insurance. A 2009
   Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found
   more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to
   Americans lacking health insurance.^[21]^[22] More broadly, estimates
   of the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or
   uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care were estimated in a
   1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.^[23] A study of the
   effects of the Massachusetts universal health care law (which took
   effect in 2006) found a 3% drop in mortality among people 20–64 years
   old - 1 death per 830 people with insurance. Other studies, just as
   those examining the randomized distribution of Medicaid insurance to
   low-income people in Oregon in 2008, found no change in death
   rate.^[24]

Waste and fraud[edit]

   In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare
   & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of
   health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1)
   overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the
   administrative complexity of the health care system, (4) burdensome
   rules and (5) fraud.^[25]

   An estimated 3%–10% of all health-care expenditures in the U.S. are
   fraudulent. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper
   payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce
   fraud include $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the
   Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences
   specified by the Affordable Care Act, and Senior Medicare
   Patrols—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.^[26]

   In 2007, the Department of Justice and Health and Human Services formed
   the Medicare Fraud Strike Force to combat fraud through data analysis
   and increased community policing. As of May, 2013, the Strike Force has
   charged more than 1,500 people for false billings of more than $5
   billion. Medicare fraud often takes the form of kickbacks and
   money-laundering. Fraud schemes often take the form of billing for
   medically unnecessary services or services not rendered.^[27]

Quality of care[edit]

   There is significant debate regarding the quality of the U.S.
   healthcare system relative to those of other countries. Physicians for
   a National Health Program, a political advocacy group, has claimed that
   a free market solution to health care provides a lower quality of care,
   with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems.^[28] The
   quality of health maintenance organizations and managed care have also
   been criticized by this same group.^[29]

   According to a 2000 study of the World Health Organization, publicly
   funded systems of industrial nations spend less on health care, both as
   a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior
   population-based health care outcomes.^[30] However, conservative
   commentator David Gratzer and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think
   tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being
   biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or
   fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their
   expected health care performance, rather than objectively comparing
   quality of care.^[31]^[32]

   Some medical researchers say that patient satisfaction surveys are a
   poor way to evaluate medical care. Researchers at the RAND Corporation
   and the Department of Veterans Affairs asked 236 elderly patients in
   two different managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care
   in medical records, as reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. There
   was no correlation. "Patient ratings of health care are easy to obtain
   and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of
   medical care," said John T. Chang, UCLA, lead author.^[33]^[34]^[35]

Public opinion[edit]

   Public opinion polls have shown a majority of the public supports
   various levels of government involvement in health care in the United
   States,^[36] with stated preferences depending on how the question is
   asked.^[37] Polls from Harvard University in 1988,^[38] the Los Angeles
   Times in 1990,^[39] and the Wall Street Journal in 1991^[40] all showed
   strong support for a health care system compared to the system in
   Canada. More recently, however, polling support has declined for that
   sort of health care system,^[36]^[37] with a 2007 Yahoo/AP poll showing
   a majority of respondents considered themselves supporters of
   "single-payer health care,"^[41] a majority in favor of a number of
   reforms according to a joint poll with the Los Angeles Times and
   Bloomberg,^[42] and a plurality of respondents in a 2009 poll for Time
   Magazine showed support for "a national single-payer plan similar to
   Medicare for all."^[43] Polls by Rasmussen Reports in 2011^[44] and
   2012^[45] showed pluralities opposed to single-payer health care. Many
   other polls show support for various levels of government involvement
   in health care, including polls from New York Times/CBS News^[46]^[47]
   and Washington Post/ABC News,^[48] showing favorability for a form of
   national health insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation^[49] showed a
   majority in favor of a form of national health insurance, often
   compared to Medicare, and a Quinnipiac poll in three states in 2008
   found majority support for the government ensuring "that everyone in
   the United States has adequate health-care" among likely Democratic
   primary voters.^[50]

   A 2001 article in the public health journal Health Affairs studied
   fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and
   concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a
   "national health care plan," poll respondents "remain satisfied with
   their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government
   to do what is right, and do not favor a single-payer type of national
   health plan."^[36] Politifact rated a statement by Michael Moore
   "false" when he stated that "[t]he majority actually want single-payer
   health care." According to Politifact, responses on these polls largely
   depend on the wording. For example, people respond more favorably when
   they are asked if they want a system "like Medicare".^[37]

Uninsured rate[edit]

   In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found
   that the uninsured rate is going down. 13.4 percent of U.S. adults are
   uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17.1
   percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11
   million individuals receiving coverage. The survey also looked at the
   major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards
   getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest
   uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their
   progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be
   major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the
   biggest drop in the uninsured rate (2.8 percentage points) was among
   households making less than $36,000 a year.^[51]^[52]^[53]

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act[edit]

   Main articles: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health
   Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010

   After campaigning on the promise of health care reform, President Obama
   gave a speech in March 2010 at a rally in Pennsylvania explaining the
   necessity of health insurance reform and calling on Congress to hold a
   final up or down vote on reform.^[54] The result of his efforts was the
   Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Because Obama's party did
   not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, the law was amended
   by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 using the
   reconciliation process in which debate in the Senate is limited and the
   filibuster is therefore not permitted.

   The legislation remains controversial,^[55]^[56]^[57] with some states
   challenging it in federal court^[58] and opposition from some
   voters.^[59] In June 2012, in a 5–4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court
   found major portions of the law to be constitutional.^[60] However, the
   law continues to face legal challenges. The latest attempt at reversing
   the Affordable Care Act occurred during the Government Shutdown on Oct
   1, 2013. Government officials that oppose the ACA tried to make
   approval of a bill to reopen the government contingent on the demise of
   the ACA. This attempt met with failure and the government reopened on
   November 16, 2013.^[61]
   Uninsured Americans, with the numbers shown here from 1987 to 2008, are
   a major driver for reform efforts

   As a result of the law, insurance companies can no longer charge
   members based on gender, burdening men with the health care costs of
   women. A study by the National Institutes of Health reported that the
   lifetime per capita expenditure at birth, using year 2000 dollars,
   showed a large difference between health care costs of females
   ($361,192) and males ($268,679). A large portion of this cost
   difference is in the shorter lifespan of men, but even after adjustment
   for age (assume men live as long as women), there still is a 20%
   difference in lifetime health care expenditures.^[62]

   The act's provisions become effective over time. The most significant
   changes, particularly affecting the availability and terms of insurance
   become effective January 1, 2014. These include an expansion of
   Medicaid (at the option of each state) to those without dependent
   children and subsidized healthcare exchanges. Changes which occur
   earlier include allowing dependents to remain on their plan until 26,
   limitations on rescission (dropping insureds when they get sick),
   removal of lifetime coverage limits, mandates that insurers fully cover
   certain preventative services, high-risk pools for uninsureds, tax
   credits for businesses to provide insurance to employees, an insurance
   company rate review program, and minimum medical loss ratios.^[3]

   The law creates the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to
   study comparative effectiveness research funded by a fee on insurers
   per covered life (starting at $1, increasing to $2 and thereafter
   adjusted according to an index^[63]). It also allowed the FDA to
   approve generic biologic drugs and specifically allows for 12 years of
   exclusive use for newly developed biologic drugs.

   In addition, the law explores some programs intended to increase
   incentives to provide quality and collaborative care, such as
   accountable care organizations. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid
   Innovation was created to fund pilot programs which may reduce
   costs;^[64] the experiments cover nearly every idea healthcare experts
   advocate, except malpractice/tort reform.^[65] The law also requires
   for reduced Medicare reimbursements for hospitals with excess
   readmissions and eventually ties physician Medicare reimbursements to
   quality of care metrics.

   The law is also designed to complement the 2009 HITECH Act which
   encourages the "meaningful use" of electronic health records; for
   example, the law directs the government to make use of these records
   for analyzing healthcare provider quality.^[66]

Alternatives and research directions[edit]

   There are alternatives to the exchange-based market system which was
   enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which have
   been proposed in the past and continue to be proposed, such as a
   single-payer system and allowing health insurance to be regulated at
   the federal level.

   In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act of
   2010 contained provisions which allows the Centers for Medicare and
   Medicaid Services (CMS) to undertake pilot projects which, if they are
   successful could be implemented in future.

Single-payer health care[edit]

   See also: Single-payer_health_care § United_States

   A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer
   healthcare system in the United States, most recently the United States
   National Health Care Act, (popularly known as H.R. 676 or "Medicare for
   All") but none have achieved more political support than 20%
   congressional co-sponsorship. Advocates argue that preventative health
   care expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per
   year because publicly funded universal health care would benefit
   employers and consumers, that employers would benefit from a bigger
   pool of potential customers and that employers would likely pay less,
   and would be spared administrative costs of health care benefits. It is
   also argued that inequities between employers would be
   reduced.^[67]^[68]^[69] Also, for example, cancer patients are more
   likely to be diagnosed at Stage I where curative treatment is typically
   a few outpatient visits, instead of at Stage III or later in an
   emergency room where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and
   is often terminal.^[70]^[71] Others have estimated a long-term savings
   amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to
   preventative health care,^[72] although estimates from the
   Congressional Budget Office and The New England Journal of Medicine
   have found that preventative care is more expensive.^[73]

   Any national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing
   insurance premiums, but advocates also believe savings would be
   realized through preventative care and the elimination of insurance
   company overhead and hospital billing costs.^[74] An analysis of a
   single-payer bill by Physicians for a National Health Program estimated
   the immediate savings at $350 billion per year.^[75] The Commonwealth
   Fund believes that, if the United States adopted a universal health
   care system, the mortality rate would improve and the country would
   save approximately $570 billion a year.^[76]

   Recent enactments of single-payer systems within individual states,
   such as in Vermont in 2011, may serve as living models supporting
   federal single-payer coverage.^[77]

Public option[edit]

   Main article: Public health insurance option

   In January 2013, Representative Jan Schakowsky and 44 other U.S. House
   of Representatives Democrats introduced H.R. 261, the "Public Option
   Deficit Reduction Act" which would amend the 2010 Affordable Care Act
   to create a public option. The bill would set up a government-run
   health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private
   insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would reduce
   the United States public debt by $104 billion over 10 years.^[78]

Balancing doctor supply and demand[edit]

   The Medicare Graduate Medical Education program regulates the supply of
   medical doctors in the U.S.^[79] By adjusting the reimbursement rates
   to establish more income equality among the medical professions, the
   effective cost of medical care can be lowered.

Bundled payments[edit]

   A key project is one that could radically change the way the medical
   profession is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The
   current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers
   is known as fee-for-service because the medical practitioner is paid
   only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued
   means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which
   generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long term
   interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as
   surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for
   the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and
   does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes
   such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups
   regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the
   patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also
   rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some^[who?] have noted that the
   best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which
   benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high
   re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded
   under the fee-for-service system.

   Projects at CMS are examining the possibility of rewarding health care
   providers through a process known as "bundled payments"^[80] by which
   local doctors and hospitals in an area would be paid not on a fee for
   service basis but on a capitation system linked to outcomes. The areas
   with the best outcomes would get more. This system, it is argued, makes
   medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that
   deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing
   the perversities inherent in the fee-for-service system.

   Though aimed as a model for health care funded by CMS, if the project
   is successful it is thought that the model could be followed by the
   commercial health insurance industry also.

          + Robert M. Ball, the then Deputy Director of the Bureau of
            Old-Age and Survivors Insurance in the Social Security
            Administration had defined the major obstacle to financing
            health insurance for the elderly several years earlier: the
            high cost of care for the aged and the generally low incomes
            of retired people. Because retired older people use much more
            medical care than younger, employed people, an insurance
            premium related to the risk for older people needed to be
            high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement,
            when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for
            the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was
            to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits
            for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the
            payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished
            in retirement without further payment.
