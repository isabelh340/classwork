French language in the United States

   For French people in the United States, see French American.
   French language in the United States. Counties and parishes marked in
   yellow are those where 6–12% of the population speak French at home;
   brown, 12–18%; red, over 18%. The census response "Cajun" and
   French-based creole languages are not included

   The French language is spoken as a minority language in the United
   States. Roughly 2.07 million Americans over the age of five reported
   speaking the language at home in a federal 2010 estimate,^[1]^[2]
   making French the fourth most-spoken language in the nation behind
   English, Spanish, and Chinese (when Cajun, Haitian Creole and all other
   forms of French are included, and when Cantonese, Mandarin and other
   varieties of Chinese are similarly combined).^[3]

   Three major varieties of French developed in the United States:
   Louisiana French, spoken in Louisiana; New England French (a local
   variant of Canadian French spoken in New England); and the nearly
   extinct Missouri French, historically spoken in Missouri and Illinois.
   More recently, French has also been carried to various parts of the
   nation via immigration from Francophone regions. Today, French is the
   second most spoken language in the two northern New England states of
   Maine and Vermont.^[2]^[4]

French ancestry[edit]

   Approximately 10,804,304 people claimed French ancestry according to
   2010 figures.^[5]

Dialects and varieties[edit]

   There are three major groups of French dialects that emerged in what is
   now the United States: Louisiana French, Missouri French, and New
   England French (essentially a variant of Canadian French).^[6]

   Louisiana French is itself traditionally divided into three dialects,
   Colonial French, Louisiana Creole French, and Cajun French.^[7]^[8]
   Colonial French is traditionally said to have been the form of French
   spoken in the early days of settlement in the lower Mississippi River
   valley, and was once the language of the educated land-owning classes.
   Cajun French, derived from Acadian French, is said to have been
   introduced with the arrival of Acadian exiles in the 18th century. The
   Acadians, the francophone inhabitants of Acadia (modern Nova Scotia,
   New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and northern Maine), were expelled
   from their homeland between 1755 and 1763 by the British. Many Acadians
   settled in lower Louisiana, where they became known as Cajuns (a
   corruption of "Acadians"). Their dialect was regarded as the typical
   language of white lower classes, while Louisiana Creole French
   developed as the language of the black community. Today, most linguists
   regard Colonial French to have largely merged with Cajun, while
   Louisiana Creole remains a distinct variety.^[8]

   Missouri French was spoken by the descendants of 17th-century French
   settlers in east central Missouri, then called Haute-Lousiane (Upper
   Louisiana), especially in the area of Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and in
   Washington County. In the 1930s there were said to be about 600
   French-speaking families in the Old Mines region between De Soto and
   Potosi.^[9] By the late 20th century the dialect was nearly extinct,
   with only a few elderly speakers able to use it.^[7]

   New England French, essentially a local variety of Canadian French, is
   spoken in parts of the New England states. This area has a legacy of
   significant immigration from Canada, especially during the 19th and the
   early 20th centuries. Some Americans of French heritage who have lost
   the language are currently attempting to revive it.^[10]^[11]

   Ernest F. Haden identifies the French of Frenchville, Pennsylvania
   (Covington Township) as a distinct dialect of North American
   French.^[12] "While the French enclave of Frenchville, Pennsylvania
   first received attention in the late 1960s, the variety of French
   spoken has not been the subject of systematic linguistic study. Haden
   reports that the geographical origin of its settlers is central France,
   as was also the case of New Orleans, but with settlement being more
   recent (1830–1840). He also reports that in the 1960s French seemed to
   be on the verge of extinction in the community."^[13]

Newer Francophone immigrants[edit]

   In Florida, the city of Miami is home to a large Francophone community,
   consisting of French expatriates, Haitians (Haitians speaking Haitian
   Creole, which is derived partially from French), and French Canadians;
   there is also a growing community of Francophone Africans in and around
   Orlando and Tampa. A small but sustaining French community that
   originated in San Francisco during the Gold Rush and was supplemented
   by French wine-making immigrants to the Bay Area is centered culturally
   around that city's French Quarter.

Francophone tourists and retirees[edit]

   Many retired individuals from Quebec have moved either to Florida or
   Hawaii, or at least spend the winter there. Also, the many Canadians
   who travel to the Southeastern states in the winter and spring include
   a number of Francophones, mostly from Quebec but also from New
   Brunswick and Ontario. Quebecers also tend to visit Louisiana, as
   Quebec and Louisiana share a number of cultural ties.

Language study[edit]

   French has traditionally been the foreign language of choice for
   English-speakers across the globe. While remaining so in Canada, Great
   Britain and Ireland, the distinction has since been claimed by Spanish
   in the United States – probably a consequence of heavy immigration
   from, and increased general interest in, Latin America. Since
   1968,^[14] French has ranked as the second-most-studied foreign
   language in the United States, behind Spanish but ahead of German.^[15]
   Many U.S. universities offer French-language courses, and degree
   programs in the language are common. However, according to the American
   Center of Applied Linguistics (CAL) and the U.S. Department of
   Education, French courses were offered in only 46 percent of American
   high schools in 2008 (down from 64 percent of high schools in
   1997).^[16] As a rule, the French taught in American classrooms is that
   of France, as opposed to Canadian French, despite the geographic
   proximity of Canada to the United States. This can cause confusion when
   U.S. students attempt to speak French in Canada, as there are
   significant dialectal differences between the two; although the
   differences are fortunately minimized if formal French is used,
   informal conversational Quebec French can be challenging for Americans
   and other non-Canadians to understand.^[citation needed] However, the
   written form of French in Quebec is the same as in France and other
   parts of Europe.

   In the fall of 2009, 216,419 American university students were enrolled
   in French courses, the second-highest total of any language (behind
   Spanish).^[17]
