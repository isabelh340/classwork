   The history of the United States from 1991 to present began after the
   fall of the Soviet Union which signaled the end of the Cold War and
   left the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The U.S.
   took a leading role in military involvement in the Middle East. The
   U.S. expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait, a Middle Eastern
   ally of the U.S., in the Persian Gulf War. On the domestic front, the
   Democrats returned to the White House with the election of Bill Clinton
   in 1992. In the 1994 midterm election, the Republicans gained control
   of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Strife between Clinton and
   the Republicans in Congress initially resulted in a federal government
   shutdown following a budget crisis, but later they worked together to
   pass welfare reform, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and a
   balanced budget. Charges from the Lewinsky scandal led to the 1998
   impeachment of Clinton by the House of Representatives but he was later
   acquitted by the Senate. The U.S. economy boomed in the enthusiasm for
   high-technology industries in the 1990s until the NASDAQ crashed as the
   dot-com bubble burst and the early 2000s recession marked the end of
   the sustained economic growth.

   In 2000, Republican George W. Bush was elected president in one of the
   closest and most controversial elections in U.S. history. Early in his
   term, his administration approved education reform and a large
   across-the-board tax cut aimed at stimulating the economy. Following
   the September 11 attacks in 2001, the U.S. embarked on the War on
   Terror, starting with the 2001 war in Afghanistan. In 2003, the U.S.
   invaded Iraq, which deposed the controversial regime of Saddam Hussein
   but also resulted in a prolonged conflict that would continue over the
   course of the decade. The Homeland Security Department was formed and
   the controversial Patriot Act was passed to bolster domestic efforts
   against terrorism. In 2006, criticism over the handling of the
   disastrous Hurricane Katrina (which struck the Gulf Coast region in
   2005), political scandals, and the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War
   helped the Democrats gain control of Congress. Saddam Hussein was later
   tried, charged for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and executed
   by hanging. In 2007, President Bush ordered a troop surge in Iraq,
   which ultimately led to reduced casualties. The collapse of the housing
   bubble, which led into the late-2000s recession, helped the Democrats
   gain the presidency in 2008 with the election of Barack Obama. The
   government enacted large loans and economic stimulus packages aimed at
   improving the economy. Obama's domestic initiatives also included the
   Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which by means of large
   reforms to the American healthcare system, created a National Health
   Insurance program. President Obama eventually withdrew combat troops
   from Iraq, and shifted the country's efforts in the War on Terror to
   Afghanistan, where a troop surge was initiated in 2009. In 2010, due to
   continued public discontent with the economic situation, unemployment,
   and federal spending, Republicans regained control of the House of
   Representatives and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate. In
   2011, Obama announced that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed
   by U.S. forces during a covert operation in Pakistan while the Iraq War
   was declared formally over the same year. The following year Obama was
   re-elected president. In June 2013, the Supreme Court struck down
   Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which resulted in the
   recognition of legally performed same-sex marriages by the federal
   government. A series of deadly mass shootings, especially the Columbine
   High School massacre, Aurora movie theater massacre, and the Sandy Hook
   Elementary School massacre, sparked a heated debate over gun control
   and the causes of these events.

Globalization and the new economy[edit]

   Clinton's terms in office will be remembered for the nation's domestic
   focus during this period. While the early 1990s saw the US economy
   mired in recession, a recovery began starting in 1994 and began
   accelerating thanks to a boom created by technology. The Internet and
   related technologies made their first broad penetrations into the
   economy, prompting a Wall Street technology-driven bubble, which
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan described in 1996 as
   "irrational exuberance". By 1998, the economy was booming and
   unemployment below 5%.^[1]

   After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States
   was the world's dominant military power and Japan, sometimes seen as
   the largest economic rival to the U.S., was caught in a period of
   stagnation.^[citation needed] China was emerging as the U.S.'s foremost
   trading competitor in more and more areas.^[citation needed] Localized
   conflicts such as those in Haiti and the Balkans prompted President
   Bill Clinton to send in U.S. troops as peacekeepers, reviving the
   Cold-War-era controversy about whether policing the rest of the world
   was a proper U.S. role. Islamic radicals overseas loudly threatened
   assaults against the U.S. for its ongoing military presence in the
   Middle East, and even staged the first World Trade Center attack, a
   truck bombing in New York's twin towers, in 1993, as well as a number
   of deadly attacks on U.S. interests abroad.

   Immigration, most of it from Latin America and Asia, swelled during the
   1990s, laying the groundwork for great changes in the demographic
   makeup of the U.S. population in coming decades, such as Hispanics
   replacing African-Americans as the largest minority. Despite tougher
   border scrutiny after the September 11 attacks, nearly 8 million
   immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005—more than in any
   other five-year period in the nation's history.^[2] Almost half entered
   illegally.^[3]

Dot-com bubble[edit]

   Main article: Dot-com bubble

   Early 2000 to 2001 saw the dramatic bursting of the dot-com bubble.
   Excitement over the prospects of Internet stocks had led to huge
   increases in the major indexes. However, dozens of start-up Internet
   companies failed as many of the lofty promises heralded by the new
   world of the Web failed to materialize. On March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ
   peaked at 5,048.62,^[4] more than double its value just a year before.
   The downturn began on March 13, 2000, triggering a chain reaction of
   selling that fed on itself as investors, funds, and institutions
   liquidated positions. In just six days, the NASDAQ had lost nearly nine
   percent, falling to 4,580 on March 15. By 2001, the bubble was
   deflating at full speed. A majority of the dot-coms ceased trading
   after burning through their venture capital, many having never made a
   profit.^[5]

   In 2002, the GDP growth rate rose to 2.8%. A major short-term problem
   in the first half of 2002 was a sharp decline in the stock market,
   fueled in part by the exposure of dubious accounting practices in some
   major corporations. Another was unemployment, which experienced the
   longest period of monthly increase since the Great Depression. The
   United States began to recover from the post-9/11 recession in 2003,
   but the robustness of the market (7% GDP growth), combined with the
   unemployment rate (above 6%), led some economists and politicians to
   refer to the situation as a "jobless recovery". Despite this, economic
   growth continued apace through early 2008 and unemployment dropped
   below 5%.^[6]

Conflicts[edit]

Gulf War[edit]

   Main article: Gulf War

   The considerable dependence of the industrialized world on oil starting
   in the 1930s, with much of the proved oil reserves situated in Middle
   Eastern countries, became evident to the U.S., first in the aftermath
   of the 1973 world oil shock and later in the second energy crisis of
   1979. Although in real terms oil prices fell back to pre-1973 levels
   through the 1980s, resulting in a windfall for the oil-consuming
   nations (especially North America, Western Europe, and Japan), the vast
   reserves of the leading Middle East producers guaranteed the region its
   strategic importance. By the early 1990s the politics of oil still
   proved as hazardous as it did in the early 1970s.

   Conflict in the Middle East triggered yet another international crisis
   on August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded and attempted to annex neighboring
   Kuwait.^[7] U.S. officials feared that Hussein was then on the verge of
   armed conflict with oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Washington's
   since the 1940s.^[8] The United Nations condemned the invasion as an
   act of aggression;^[9] President Bush compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler
   and declared that if the United States and international community did
   not act, aggression would be encouraged elsewhere in the
   world.^[10]^[11] The Security Council gave Iraq a deadline to leave
   Kuwait, but Saddam Hussein ignored it, and the Security Council
   authorized a military response. The war began in January 1991, with
   U.S. troops forming the majority of the coalition which participated in
   Operation Desert Storm. By the time Iraqi troops withdrew from Kuwait
   in late February, Iraq had lost approximately 20,000 troops, with some
   sources citing as many as 100,000 casualties on the Iraqi
   side.^[12]^[13]^[14]

Conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Middle East[edit]

   of Mogadishu, part of U.S. involvement in Somalia in the early 1990s.

   In December 1992, President Bush sent troops to join the UN Operation
   Restore Hope, a multi-national effort to restore order and provide
   humanitarian aid in Somalia, which was torn by civil war, famine, and
   warlords.^[15] By the summer of 1993, the situation had deteriorated.
   After 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in June 1993, the UN passed a
   resolution calling for the arrest and trial of those responsible for
   the attack.^[16] Under the leadership of newly elected President Bill
   Clinton, U.S. forces launched a concentrated attack on Aidid's
   stronghold in Mogadishu in Operation Gothic Serpent. In October 1993,
   18 soldiers were killed and 84 were wounded in the Battle of
   Mogadishu.^[17] After the attack, Clinton ordered U.S. forces withdrawn
   from the region, with the last being withdrawn by 1995, and fired his
   Secretary of Defense Les Aspin who had not sent adequate forces.^[18]

   In the mid-1990s, the United States was involved in the Bosnian War
   through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), most notably the
   1995 bombing campaign,^[19] which finally led to the Dayton Peace
   Agreement which ended the war by the end of 1995.^[20] In early 1998,
   the region became volatile again as war erupted between the army of the
   Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
   guerrilla group.^[21] A 1999 NATO bombing campaign struck Yugoslavia,
   resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Yugoslavian soldiers and
   civilians. As a result, Yugoslavia withdrew from Kosovo and Kosovo
   became an independent state.^[22]

   President Clinton also presided over cruise missile strikes on Iraq in
   1996 and bombing attacks on Iraq in 1998,^[23] which were launched in
   response to Saddam Hussein's violation of several UN resolutions,
   including repression of ethnic minorities (Kurds) and removing UN
   weapons inspectors. The 1998 campaign, in particular, was meant to
   de-stabilize the Iraqi government and degrade the power of Hussein.
   Clinton also signed the Iraq Liberation Act to appropriate funds to
   Iraqi opposition groups in the hopes of overthrowing Hussein's regime
   and establishing democracy.^[24]

   Throughout the 1990s, the United States also played an active role in
   peace efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Clinton,
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian Prime Minister
   Yasser Arafat met and the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, which
   called for the gradual ceding of control of Palestinian areas to the
   Palestinians in exchange for peace.^[25] However, Rabin was
   assassinated in 1995 and by 2000, the Camp David Summit failed to yield
   a new agreement.^[26]^[27]

Early al-Qaeda attacks[edit]

   1993 began a series of increasingly high-profile attacks associated
   with al-Qaeda, a radical Muslim militant organization led by Osama bin
   Laden. On February 26, 1993, a truck bomb was detonated at the World
   Trade Center in New York City, killing 6 and injuring over 1000. The
   attack was intended to destroy the foundation of the North Tower,
   knocking the tower into the South Tower, which would destroy both
   buildings and kill thousands of people. While this did not happen, the
   bomb caused considerable damage to the lower levels of the North Tower.
   In 1994, four men were convicted of carrying out the bombing and in
   1997, two men were convicted for their roles, including the truck
   driver and the mastermind, Ramzi Yousef.^[28]^[29]

   On June 25, 1996, al-Qaeda terrorists bombed the Khobar Towers, a
   complex in Saudi Arabia where members of the U.S. military were being
   housed, killing 19 American servicemen and injuring over 300.^[30]

   Al-Qaeda bombed the U.S. Embassy in Kenya on August 7, 1998, killing
   224 people, including 12 Americans.^[31] The U.S. launched cruise
   missile strikes on a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan,^[32] yet
   this failed to destroy al-Qaeda's vast network. In October 2000,
   al-Qaeda militants bombed the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen, killing
   17 servicemen and severely damaging the ship.^[33]

Terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001[edit]

   Main article: September 11 attacks

   On the morning of September 11, 2001, four airliners were hijacked by
   19 members of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda.^[34] The first
   hijacked airliner, American Airlines Flight 11, struck the North Tower
   of the World Trade Center at 8:46 A.M. (EST) in New York City; with a
   second, United Airlines Flight 175, striking the South Tower less than
   twenty minutes later.^[35] The third hijacked plane, American Airlines
   Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the U.S.
   Department of Defense), in Arlington, Virginia 50 minutes after the
   first attack.^[36] After discovering that their plane had been
   hijacked, passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 attempted to regain
   control of the plane which had been redirected towards Washington
   D.C.^[37] However, after regaining control from the hijackers, the
   plane crashed near a rural community near Shanksville, Pennsylvania,
   killing all 40 passengers on board.^[38] The attack killed 2,550
   American civilians and 55 military personnel, along with 372
   non-Americans (excluding the 19 hijackers).^[39] The 9/11 attack was
   the single deadliest international terrorist incident and the most
   devastating foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese surprise
   attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.^[40] It refocused American
   attention to a long war on terrorism, beginning with an attack on
   al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan War[edit]

   Main article: War in Afghanistan (2001–present)
   President Bush addresses rescue workers at Ground Zero in New York,
   after September 11 attacks: "I can hear you. The rest of the world
   hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear
   all of us soon."

   After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of
   Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing the President "all
   necessary and appropriate force against the nations, organizations, or
   persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the
   terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001."^[41] This act
   resulted in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, in President George W.
   Bush's broader Global War on Terrorism. The objective of the 2001
   invasion, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, was to remove the
   Islamic fundamentalist Taliban lead government from power in
   Afghanistan, and to capture top level al-Qaeda leaders, including its
   founder Osama bin Laden.^[42] The invasion, fought in conjunction with
   the U.S.'s NATO allies, began on October 7, 2001, quickly leading to
   the overthrow of the Taliban government and implementation of Hamid
   Karzai as Afghanistan's interim president.^[43]^[44] In early 2002,
   after the Battle of Tora Bora and success with Operation Anaconda, the
   United States began focusing on military intervention in Iraq, shifting
   military and intelligence resources away from Afghanistan in War on
   Terror, with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stating in May
   2003 that the "major combat" in the conflict was over.^[45]^[46] With
   the approval of the new Afghan Constitution by the Loya jirga and
   election of President Karzai in 2004, Afghanistan later held its first
   parliamentary elections in over 30 years in 2005.^[47]^[48]^[49]

   With a total of 22,000 U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan by May
   2006,^[50] the U.S. joined in the ISAF lead Operation Mountain Thrust.
   In the attempt to quell the Taliban insurgency in southern Afghanistan,
   more than 1,000 insurgents and 150 ISAF troops were killed in the
   two-month operation, being the bloodiest period since the start of the
   war in 2001.^[51] With ISAF assuming complete command of security
   forces in Afghanistan in October 2006, the U.S. saw mounting skepticism
   from European allies over the war at the 2006 Riga summit.^[52]^[53]
   U.S.-Afghan diplomatic relations began to flare after the August 2008
   Azizabad airstrike in Herat Province, which killed 91 civilians,
   including 60 children and 15 women.^[54]^[55] The attack sparked
   protest over "collateral damage"; with a 40% increase in civilian
   deaths in 2008.^[56]
   U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.

   In September 2008, President Bush announced he would shift 4,500 U.S.
   troops from Iraq to the conflict in Afghanistan.^[57] This was followed
   with recently elected President Barack Obama announcing in February
   2009 that the U.S. would deploy an additional 17,000 troops to
   Afghanistan.^[58] The Obama administration also later announced a
   "troop surge" of an additional 30,000 U.S. military forces to be
   deployed in the summer of 2010, and to begin withdrawals of the 100,000
   total U.S. troops in July 2011.^[59] With the surge in effect, ISAF
   launched Operation Moshtarak, an offensive determined to eliminate
   Taliban insurgents from Helmand Province.^[60] At 15,000 troops, it was
   the largest joint operation of the war.^[61]

   After a 2010 profile on U.S. Army General and ISAF Commander Stanley
   McChrystal was published in Rolling Stone Magazine,^[62] McChrystal was
   forced to resigned from his position after making controversial remarks
   about Obama administration officials.^[63] President Obama then
   announced ISAF to be commanded by General David Petraeus.^[64]

   On May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the U.S.
   conducted an operation that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at
   his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.^[65] The announcement drew
   worldwide praise, with spontaneous celebrations at Ground Zero, Times
   Square and out side of the White House.^[66] The raid on bin Laden's
   compound in Abbottabad led to a rise in diplomatic tensions between the
   U.S. and Pakistan.^[67] With civilian deaths from the U.S.'s drone
   program in so called "signature strikes", the 2011 NATO attack in
   Pakistan, which led to the deaths of 24 Pakistani military officers,
   and the closure of NATO supply lines to neighboring Afghanistan,
   U.S.-Pakistan relations remain fractured as a result of the War on
   Terror.^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]

   In mid-2011 President Obama announced the start of the withdrawal of
   the additional 33,000 troops deployed from the 2010 troop surge.^[71]
   By December 2011, the first round of 10,000 troops were withdrawn, with
   the second round of 23,000 troops later withdrawn in September
   2012.^[72]^[73]

   As of February 2014, a total of 2,307 U.S. troops were killed and
   19,656 injured due to the Afghanistan War.^[74] Estimates from the
   Brown University Watson Institute for International Studies also
   suggest that between 16,725–19,013 Afghan civilians died as a result of
   the war.^[75]

Iraq War[edit]

   Main article: Iraq War

   Square, Baghdad, Iraq.

   In his State of the Union address in January 2002, President George W.
   Bush called Iran, Iraq, and North Korea an "axis of evil".^[76] The
   Bush administration later began making a public case for an invasion of
   Iraq, accusing them of violating the 1991 UN-imposed ceasefire,
   supporting terrorism and being in possession of weapons of mass
   destruction (later, the latter of these accusations were proved to be
   false, and the first two are considered very dubious by most
   historians).^[77]

   Some important allies of the U.S., including India, Japan, Turkey, New
   Zealand, France, Germany, and Canada, did not believe that the evidence
   for the President's accusations was well-founded enough to justify a
   full-scale invasion, especially as military personnel were still needed
   in Afghanistan. The UN Security Council did not approve of the
   invasion, and the U.S. therefore provided most of the forces in the
   invasion of Iraq. With the support of a coalition whose major partners
   included the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, and Italy, Iraq
   was invaded on March 20, 2003.
   A graph of U.S. troop fatalities in Iraq. The orange months are
   post-troop surge and the blue months are under the Obama
   administration.

   After six weeks of combat between the coalition and the Iraqi army, the
   invading forces had secured control of many key regions; Hussein had
   fled his palace, his regime clearly over; on May 1, President Bush
   declared, under a sign reading "mission accomplished", that major
   ground operations were at an end. Saddam Hussein's sons Qusay and Uday
   were killed by U.S. forces; Saddam himself was captured in December
   2003 and taken into custody. Nevertheless, fighting with the Iraqi
   insurgency continued and escalated through the 2004 U.S. national
   elections and beyond.

   With casualties increasing and the cost of the invasion and
   reconstruction of Iraq estimated at over $200 billion, the war has lost
   about one-third of its supporters in the U.S. since the end of major
   operations was announced. Contemporary polls suggested that
   international displeasure with the United States was at an all-time
   high, with a majority of people in Europe believing that the country
   was too powerful and acted mainly in self-interest, and a vast majority
   in predominantly Muslim nations believing that the United States was
   arrogant, belligerent, or hateful to Islam.^[78]

   As the situation in Iraq became increasingly difficult, policymakers
   began looking for new options. This led to the formation of the Iraq
   Study Group, a nonpartisan commission chaired by James Baker and Lee H.
   Hamilton. This produced a variety of proposals; some of the more
   notable ones were to seek decreased US presence in Iraq, increased
   engagement with neighboring countries, and greater attention to
   resolving other local conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict. The recommendations were generally ignored, and instead,
   President Bush ordered a surge of troops to Iraq in 2007 and 2008.
   Violence in the country declined in 2008 and 2009, and the U.S. combat
   role ended in August 2010. U.S. forces were withdrawn in large numbers
   in 2009 and 2010, and the war was declared formally over in December
   2011.^[79]

Domestic terrorism[edit]

   Aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing

   The 1990s and 2000s (decade) became known for several incidents of
   domestic terrorism, usually perpetrated by those dissatisfied with
   actions of the federal government, big business, or other aspects of
   American society.^[80]^[81]

   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a mysterious man known in the media as
   the "Unabomber" sent mail bombs to figures in the academic and airline
   industries for various reasons.^[82] After a lull, he began another
   mail bombing campaign in earnest, beginning in 1993.^[83] Two people
   were killed in the mid-1990s and an exhaustive and expensive
   investigation by the FBI coupled with intense national media interest
   in the story resulted in the identification and arrest of the
   perpetrator Theodore Kaczynski, who was sentenced to life in prison.

   On April 19, 1995, a truck bomb was detonated outside the Alfred P.
   Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people
   and injuring over 600.^[84] The bombing became the deadliest act of
   domestic terrorism in the United States and led to sweeping reforms in
   United States federal building security.^[85] The attack's perpetrator,
   Timothy McVeigh, was an anti-government extremist who used the Waco
   Siege and Ruby Ridge incidents as justification for his retaliation
   against the federal government.^[86] While McVeigh wanted to
   specifically target the federal agencies involved in the Waco siege,
   such as the ATF and DEA,^[87] the bombing killed many innocent
   civilians, including 19 children.^[88] McVeigh was executed in 2001 and
   his accomplice Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.^[89]

   In July 1996, in the midst of the 1996 Summer Olympics at Centennial
   Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia, a homemade bomb was detonated,
   resulting in the deaths of 2 people and injuring over 100.^[90] This
   was followed by similar attacks at two abortion clinics and a lesbian
   nightclub.^[91] In 2003, suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was arrested and
   sentenced in 2005 to five life sentences for these attacks.^[92]^[93]

   In 2001, only days after the September 11 attacks, letters laced with
   anthrax were sent to several individuals, including prominent news
   personalities and government officials.^[94] The letters killed 5
   people and infected a further 17.^[95]^[96] This incident of
   bioterrorism was initially blamed on international terrorist
   organization al-Qaeda, but in 2008, was determined to stem from a
   Maryland scientist by the name of Bruce Edward Ivins, who committed
   suicide before he could be prosecuted.^[97]^[98]

   On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded near the finish line of the
   Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, killing three people and
   injuring over 280.^[99] Three days later, suspects Tamerlan and
   Dzhokhar Tsarnaev led Boston police on a high speed chase, after
   killing one officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.^[100]
   Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police^[101] and a seriously
   injured Dzhokhar was taken into custody in nearby Watertown the
   following day.^[102]

Crime and violence[edit]

   A makeshift memorial in tribute to the victims of the Northern Illinois
   University shooting, one of many school shootings that afflicted the
   United States.

   The crime epidemic that had begun during the late 1960s finally reached
   its climax in the early 1990s before starting a steady decline during
   the Clinton years.^[103]^[104]^[105] Nevertheless, ongoing addiction
   (involving sales of marijuana and cocaine) continued to be a major
   factor in crime in the United States. The overall rate of major crimes
   fell during the period. In 2009, the FBI estimated 1,318,000 violent
   crimes occurred nationwide, which was 7.5% below the 2000 level of
   1,425,000 and 31% below the 1991 level of 1,912,000.^[106] The decline
   in crime rates was attributed to several factors, including stricter
   judicial sentencing practices, the implementation of Three Strikes
   laws, improving law enforcement technology that made it easier to catch
   felons, and the end of the crack epidemic.

   In 1992, riots occurred in Los Angeles after four police officers were
   acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King.^[107] The riots
   occurred primarily in South Central Los Angeles, a predominantly black
   and Hispanic area.^[108] Fifty-five people were killed and more than
   2000 were injured.^[109] 3,600 fires were set, destroying over 1,000
   buildings and widespread looting occurred, especially of businesses
   owned by Korean Americans.^[110]^[111] In all, nearly $1 billion in
   damage was caused.^[112]

   In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), a number of highly publicized assaults
   against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people occurred in the
   United States. The most well known of these was the murder of Matthew
   Shepard in Wyoming after two young men kidnapped, tortured, and
   murdered him in 1998.^[113] In 2009, Congress passed the Matthew
   Shepard Act, which extended the hate crime law to women, the disabled,
   and gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals.^[114]

   A spate of school shootings rocked the country in the late 1990s, the
   2000s, and early 2010s, the deadliest of which were the Westside Middle
   School massacre (1998), the Columbine High School massacre (1999), the
   Red Lake High School massacre (2005), the Amish school shooting (2006),
   the Virginia Tech massacre (2007), the Northern Illinois University
   shooting (2008), the Oikos University shooting (2012), and the Sandy
   Hook Elementary School shooting (2012).^[115] Those shootings have led
   to an increasing debate over gun politics and media violence, and led
   to increased focus on mental health, school safety, and anti-bullying.

   The Capital Region was struck by the Beltway sniper attacks, a series
   of sniper attacks on civilians and federal workers by two gunmen over a
   month-long period in October 2002.^[116] The attackers killed 10 people
   and injured three.^[117] Two men were arrested and convicted.^[118]

   During the 2000s, a series of high-profile child abduction cases
   occurred, including Danielle van Dam (2001), Samantha Runnion (2001),
   Carly Brucia (2003), Elizabeth Smart (2003), Jessica Lunsford (2005),
   and Somer Thompson (2009). In addition, a woman named Jaycee Dugard was
   found alive after having been kidnapped in 1991 at the age of 11 and
   held captive for 17 years. These incidents led to a public outcry and
   demands for stricter laws against sex offenders, the most notable of
   which was Jessica's Law.

   In November 2009, U.S. Army major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 fellow
   servicemen and injured 30 in the Fort Hood shooting in Killeen,
   Texas.^[119] While the act was called terrorism by some due to Hasan's
   Muslim heritage, the attack was ruled out by the FBI to have been
   perpetrated by a terrorist organization. On January 8, 2011, U.S.
   Representative Gabrielle Giffords was the target of an assassination
   attempt, when a gunman went on a shooting spree, critically injuring
   Giffords, killing federal judge John Roll and five other people, and
   wounding at least 14 others.^[120] In July 2012, a man shot 70 people
   (the highest number of victims of any mass shooting in American
   history) at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing twelve and
   injuring 58 others.^[121] In May 2014, a gunman inspired by a
   misogynistic vendetta stabbed and shot to death six students at the
   University of California, Santa Barbara before committing suicide.

Disasters[edit]

Natural disasters[edit]

   On August 24, 1992, the category-five Hurricane Andrew made landfall in
   South Florida, devastating the southern suburbs of Miami, including
   Homestead, Kendall, and Cutler Ridge. Two days later, the storm made
   landfall again in a sparsely populated part of Louisiana, with
   relatively less damage than in Florida. The storm killed 26 people
   directly, 39 indirectly. With $26 billion in damage, it became the
   costliest storm in history at that time. The storm was known for many
   controversies including the sluggish federal response, which may have
   impacted President George H.W. Bush's image on domestic issues, as well
   as poor housing construction which may have led to such high levels of
   destruction.
   Satellite image of the "Storm of the Century"

   In March 1993, a massive storm, known as the "Storm of the Century" or
   "Superstorm" struck the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. The
   storm set low pressure records; produced hurricane-force winds, storm
   surge, and killer tornadoes in Florida; and produced snowfall up to 2
   feet (61 cm) across many portions of the Eastern United States. The
   storm was particularly crippling to the Southern United States, where
   places like Birmingham, Alabama received one-and-a-half feet of snow
   and record low temperatures, highly unusual for the region. In all, 300
   deaths were attributed to the storm and $6 billion in damage was
   caused.

   The Great Flood of 1993 affected the Midwestern United States in the
   spring and summer of that year, devastating large portions of the
   Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys and their tributaries. Many
   small towns were devastated and agricultural losses were significant.
   10,000 homes were destroyed and 15 million acres (61,000 km^2) of
   agricultural lands were inundated. 50 people perished in the floods and
   $15 billion in damage was done.

   In the early morning hours of January 17, 1994, the San Fernando Valley
   region of Los Angeles was hit by a 6.7 magnitude earthquake, known as
   the "Northridge earthquake". The quake killed more than 70 people and
   injured 9,000. Most of the fatalities were attributed to collapsed
   buildings, parking structures, or freeways. Striking an urban area, it
   was very destructive, causing $20 billion in damage.

   In July 1995, the city of Chicago was hit by a heat wave that had
   severe repercussions. During a five-day spell from July 12 to 16, the
   high temperature hovered from the mid 90s to the mid 100s. The heat
   index pushed 120 degrees on many days. The heat wave resulted in the
   deaths of over 700 people, many of whom were black, elderly, or poor.
   The event brought increased attention to these segments of the
   population and the importance of reaching out to them during heat
   waves, as well as the concept of the urban heat island effect, in which
   urban environments exacerbate heat and humidity levels. Additionally,
   power failures and lack of adequate warning and general preparedness
   aggravated the situation and may have contributed to such high
   fatalities.

   In January 1996, the Blizzard of 1996 affected the Northeastern and
   Mid-Atlantic United States, dumping up to 36 inches (91 cm) of snow on
   many areas, crippling major American cities like Washington, D.C.,
   Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. The storm killed
   150 people and caused $3 billion in damages.

   On May 3, 1999, a violent tornado outbreak struck the Southern Great
   Plains, predominantly Oklahoma. The most destructive tornado was an F5
   tornado that struck Oklahoma City and the suburb of Moore. The tornado
   is one of the most prominent examples of a tornado striking a major
   urban area and became the first tornado to incur over $1 billion in
   damages. In all, the outbreak resulted in 50 deaths and over 600
   injuries.

   In 2004, four hurricanes--Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne—struck the
   state of Florida in a one-month timespan, resulting in over 100 U.S.
   deaths and nearly $50 billion in damage combined. Out of the four
   hurricanes, Ivan was the deadliest in the U.S., while Charley was the
   most destructive.
   Flooding due to Hurricane Katrina

   2005 brought the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded
   history. In August 2005, the powerful Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf
   Coast region. Katrina broke the levees of New Orleans, Louisiana and
   flooded 80% of the low-lying city. Extensive devastation and flooding
   also occurred from Mobile, Alabama west to Beaumont, Texas, with the
   Mississippi coastline especially hard hit. At least 1,800 lives were
   lost in the worst domestic calamity since the 1928 Okeechobee
   hurricane. Port facilities, oil rigs and refineries in the Gulf region
   were damaged, further increasing already high U.S. fuel prices.
   Residents of New Orleans, many of whom were impoverished and unable (or
   unwilling) to evacuate before the storm, were trapped for days by the
   flood waters. Tens of thousands had to be rescued by the U.S. military
   from their rooftops or from unsanitary and dangerous shelters in public
   buildings. State and local authorities were overwhelmed by the scale of
   the events. Their response to the disaster, as well the federal
   government's, were harshly criticized by legislators and citizens who
   saw in the confusion a dangerous lack of readiness and inability to
   preserve public safety. President Bush promised that the federal
   government would underwrite the rebuilding of New Orleans and other
   storm-damaged areas, the cost of which was estimated to run as high as
   $200 billion. Only weeks after Katrina, Hurricane Rita struck the
   Texas/Louisiana border in September. Rita caused the largest evacuation
   in U.S. history, as millions of people fled the Houston area, as well
   as portions of Louisiana. Rita resulted in over 100 fatalities, the
   vast majority of which were indirect, occurring during the evacuation
   or in the aftermath of the storm. Additionally, $10 billion in damage
   was attributed to Rita. Later in the season, Hurricane Wilma struck the
   state of Florida in October 2005, killing 35 people and doing $20
   billion worth of damage. The storm yielded the lowest pressure value
   ever recorded in history before making landfall in Florida, making it
   the most intense storm on record.

   On Super Tuesday in February 2008, in the midst of heated primary
   elections in multiple states, a destructive tornado outbreak hit the
   Mid-South region, spawning dangerous nighttime twisters across the
   region. A total of 87 tornadoes were reported. Over 60 people were
   killed across Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Alabama and hundreds
   were injured. Losses exceeded $1 billion. The outbreak was the
   deadliest outbreak in the U.S. in 23 years, and brought renewed
   attention to the dangers of nighttime tornadoes, winter tornadoes, and
   the vulnerability of populations in the Southern United States.

   In September 2008, after two straight years of not being affected by a
   serious hurricane, Hurricane Gustav caused $18 billion in damage in
   Louisiana, and a few weeks later, the Galveston, Texas and Houston,
   Texas areas were devastated by Hurricane Ike with over $31 billion in
   damage, making Ike the third most destructive hurricane ever to hit the
   United States behind Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina. Over 100 people
   were killed. The hurricanes also caused gas prices to spike to around
   $4 per gallon.

   In the spring of 2011, several major tornado outbreaks affected the
   Central and Southern United States. 43 people were killed in a tornado
   outbreak from April 14–16.^[123]^[124] Approximately 350+ people were
   killed in a tornado outbreak from April 25 – 28, the deadliest U.S.
   tornado outbreak in 75 years (since the 1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado
   outbreak).^[125]^[126]^[127]^[128] States particularly hit hard by the
   outbreaks included Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia,
   North Carolina, Virginia, and most especially, Alabama, which sustained
   over 250 fatalities alone. The latter outbreak produced $10 billion in
   damage, making it the costliest tornado outbreak in history.^[129] On
   May 22, an EF5 tornado devastated Joplin, Missouri, killing 154,
   injuring over 1,000 people, and causing $1–3 billion in damage, making
   it the deadliest single U.S. tornado in 64 years and the costliest
   single tornado of all time.^[130]^[131]

   In August 2011, Hurricane Irene was the first hurricane to make
   landfall since Ike in 2008, striking the Eastern Seaboard of the United
   States, making landfalls in North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York.
   The storm killed at least 45 people and caused $10 billion in damage.
   The storm was particularly notable for its extensive flooding in the
   Northeast, and a couple days later, Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in
   Louisiana, its remnants tracking to the Northeast for even more
   devastating floods.

   In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast of the United
   States, making landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The storm
   knocked out power to millions of people and caused flooding in parts of
   New York City along with devastation to the Jersey Shore and portions
   of Long Island and Staten Island. The storm has been blamed for 121
   fatalities and is estimated to have caused at least $50 billion in
   damage.

   In May 2013, at least 24 people were killed, 377 people were injured,
   and $1.5 to $3 billion in damage was caused when an EF5 tornado struck
   the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, which was hit by a deadly and
   destructive F5 tornado only 14 years prior.

Other disasters[edit]

   The Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns after exploding in April 2010. The
   disaster led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history.

   Notable aviation disasters in the 1990s included TWA Flight 800
   crashing off the coast of Long Island, en route to Paris, France, on
   July 17, 1996 due to an explosion of the fuel tank, killing 230 and
   EgyptAir Flight 990 crashing south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, en
   route to Cairo, Egypt, on October 31, 1999 due to deliberate crashing
   by the first officer, killing 217. Shortly after the 9/11 terrorist
   attacks, the second-deadliest U.S. aviation incident occurred when
   American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Queens, New York, en route to
   the Dominican Republic, on November 12, 2001 due to overuse of rudder
   controls by the pilot to counteract turbulence, killing 265 (including
   5 on the ground).

   On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon
   re-entry to the Earth over parts of Texas and Louisiana during STS-107,
   resulting in the deaths of all seven astronauts.^[132] The incident
   resulted from a piece of foam insulation that fell off during launch,
   which struck the shuttle, creating a hole that allowed hot gases to
   penetrate the shuttle during re-entry.^[133] In the aftermath of the
   disaster, the space shuttle program was suspended for 29 months as NASA
   investigated the incident and made plans to prevent future tragedies.

   On February 17, 2003, a stampede occurred at the E2 nightclub in
   Chicago, after an incident involving pepper spray, resulting in the
   deaths of 21 people.^[134] Three days later, on February 20, 100 people
   perished and over 200 were injured in The Station nightclub fire in
   West Warwick, Rhode Island, when pyrotechnics ignited flammable
   sound-proofing during a performance by the band Great White.^[135] Both
   incidents brought attention to the need to crack down on building,
   fire, and safety code violations to prevent future tragedies. A porch
   collapse that killed 13 and seriously injured 57 in June 2003 in
   Chicago further emphasized the problems with building code violations
   in the United States.

   On August 1, 2007, the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis
   collapsed into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people and injuring
   over 50. The bridge was under construction at the time. The incident
   brought to attention the need to inspect and rehabilitate the aging
   infrastructure system in the United States.

   On April 20, 2010, an off shore oil drilling rig, the Deepwater
   Horizon, exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of
   Mexico. Dozens of workers fled the flames and were rescued by lifeboats
   and helicopters, however 11 were killed and 17 were injured in the
   incident. The rig burned for 36 hours before sinking. On April 24, it
   was discovered that a damaged wellhead was leaking oil into the Gulf of
   Mexico at a rapid rate. For approximately 90 days, tens of thousands of
   barrels of oil leaked into the ocean every day, resulting in the
   largest oil spill in United States history. The wellhead was
   successfully contained in mid-July, stopping the flow, and efforts are
   ongoing to cap the wellhead and create a replacement well. Despite
   significant efforts to protect coastlines, the spill has had
   devastating impacts on the environment and the economies of the Gulf
   Coast states. The Obama administration has ordered well operator BP
   responsible for all cleanup costs, which are expected to run in the
   tens of billions of dollars. The spill has resulted in negative public
   approval ratings of the U.S. government, the Obama administration, and
   BP, for their handling of the spill, with BP suffering the worst
   ratings.

Energy issues[edit]

   US energy consumption 1980–2008, with projections to 2035^[136]

   After 1970 the U.S. began importing oil, as consumption kept rising and
   the nation's oil fields became less productive. Throughout the 1990s
   the world price of crude oil range between $10 and $40, and the average
   price at the pump did not exceed $1.40. Oil prices tripled after 2002,
   peaking at $147 in July 2008, about $4 a gallon; the price has
   continued to fluctuate widely.^[137] The theme of "energy independence"
   led to legislation mandating more fuel efficient autos—even electric
   vehicles—and more efficient use of energy, ranging from insulation to
   new light bulbs. Even worse than the high price, was the fear of
   shortages. Many proposals and pilot projects for replacement energy
   sources, from ethanol to wind power and solar power were discussed and,
   indeed, funded by Congress after 2000.^[138] In the economic stimulus
   package signed by President Obama in early 2009, billions of dollars
   were allocated for research and development of new energy sources.

   While public attention focused on supplies from the Middle East, the
   main source was actually Canada. After 2007, new methods of extraction
   opened up vast new deposits of oil in the Bakken Formation in North
   Dakota and Montana. As much as two trillion dollars worth of natural
   gas is potentially available in the Marcellus Formation deposits
   located in the historic 19th-century oil fields in Appalachia,
   stretching from West Virginia through Pennsylvania into western New
   York. However, there is sharp debate underway regarding the
   environmental impact on the region's fresh water supply.^[139] The
   question of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) was
   highly controversial, as Republican proposals were blocked by the
   Democrats in Congress.^[140] Republicans in 2008 were campaigning for
   more offshore drilling, with the slogan "drill, baby, drill", but the
   2010 Gulf oil spill put all new drilling on hold.

Politics[edit]

The Clinton administration[edit]

   Main article: Presidency of Bill Clinton
   See also: Timeline of modern American conservatism
   President Clinton's First Cabinet, 1993

   Following the success of the First Gulf War, George H. W. Bush enjoyed
   very high approval ratings as president.^[141] However, economic
   recession and a reneged campaign pledge dogged Bush, sinking his
   formerly high approval ratings from the high 80s to the lower 40s and
   upper 30s. In the wake of Bush's political problems, Bill Clinton won
   the 1992 contest with 43% of the vote in a three way race against
   Bush's 38%. Independent candidate Ross Perot tapped the discontent of
   the electorate with both parties, drawing roughly evenly from both
   candidates^[142] to receive a record 19% of the popular vote, but no
   electoral votes.^[143] Perot's result qualified his Reform Party to
   receive Federal Election Commission matching funds for campaign
   contributions in the 1996 election, thus laying the groundwork for
   another three-way race during the 1996 presidential election.

   Aged 46 when he took office in January 1993, Clinton was one of the
   youngest presidents in US history and the first born after WWII.
   Historians and political analysts immediately referred to him as
   marking a "generational shift" in American politics similar to when
   John F. Kennedy had become the first president born in the 20th
   century. His promising to focus on and resolve some of the United
   States' many domestic issues, he entered office with high expectations.
   Immediately, however, he was hurt when he had to withdraw major
   nominees (over nonpayment of taxes). Clinton's surgeon general, Jocelyn
   Elders, attracted controversy over public remarks that "it would be
   good for parents to teach their children about masturbation". Much of
   his planned activity was overwhelmed by the intense debate over his
   proposal to permit gays to serve in the military. In addition, the
   president had a difficult time gaining the respect of the US military
   establishment due to having been painted as a Vietnam War draft dodger.
   The outcome was a new "don't ask, don't tell" compromise policy and
   loss of initiative in other areas.^[144]

   One early domestic victory of the Clinton administration was the
   enactment of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban.^[145] The ban was widely
   decried by the Republicans, who allowed it to lapse in 2004 while they
   controlled both Congress and the presidency.^[146] Bill Clinton's
   proposal of a national health care system, championed by his wife
   Hillary Rodham Clinton,^[147] ignited a political firestorm on the
   right, which vigorously opposed it on the general principle that
   government size should be reduced not expanded. The proposed system did
   not survive the debate.^[147] However Hillary Clinton did succeed,
   along with a bipartisan coalition of members of congress, in
   establishing the Children's Health Insurance Program.

The Republican Congress[edit]

   Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, 1995–1999

   The New Deal, the Great Society, and Watergate helped solidify
   Democratic control of Congress, but the 1980s and early 1990s were a
   period of fragmentation of their coalition, when the popularity of
   Democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing
   disenchantment with Congress' governing capacities. The strongly
   liberal policies of Clinton's first two years in office were also a
   cause of controversy, and the Democrats suddenly lost control of the
   House and the Senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994
   midterm elections. Once in power, House Republicans, led by Newt
   Gingrich, faced the difficulty of learning to govern after 40 years as
   the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their "Contract with
   America", which they unveiled on the steps of Congress on September 27,
   1994.

   Along with strong backing from traditional Democrats and liberals,
   Clinton was able to garner the support of moderates^[who?] who
   appreciated his centrist "New Democrat" policies, which steered away
   from the expansion of government services of the New Deal and Great
   Society and allowed him to "triangulate", taking away many of the
   Republicans' top issues. One example of such compromises was welfare
   reform legislation signed into law in 1996. The new law required
   welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed
   limits on how long individuals may receive payments, but did allow
   states to exempt 20% of their caseloads from the time limits. Clinton
   also pursued tough^[according to whom?] federal anti-crime measures,
   steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs, and calling for
   the hiring of 100,000 new police officers. Compromise came with
   difficulty, though, as the parties failed to agree on a budget, causing
   the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996. By
   the end of his administration, the federal government had experienced
   the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus.
   The first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969
   in which the federal government did not borrow from the Social Security

   In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton faced Bob Dole, Republican
   Senator from Kansas. An uninspired centrist, Dole failed to attract the
   support of the GOP base and the incumbent president pulled to victory
   in the November election. Ross Perot ran for a second time, but was not
   allowed at the debate between Clinton and Dole and failed to attract as
   much support as he had in 1992. As a sign of the general cynicism and
   voter apathy during this period, turnout for the election was only 49%.

   Many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook long-standing
   rumors of extramarital affairs by Clinton, deeming them irrelevant.
   These matters came to a head, however, in February 1998 when reports
   surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between Clinton and a White House
   intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton initially and vigorously denied the
   relationship; "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
   Lewinsky."^[148] His wife Hillary described the allegations as
   fraudulent smears dredged up by a "vast right-wing conspiracy."^[149]
   Clinton was forced to retract his assertions in August 1998 after the
   Lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel Kenneth
   Starr. Clinton was impeached in the United States House of
   Representatives, but acquitted at his trial by the U.S. Senate.^[150] A
   public backlash forced Speaker Gingrich to resign after a poor showing
   in the 1998 midterm elections. In 1999, Republican Dennis Hastert of
   Illinois became Speaker of the House, a position he would hold until
   2007, making him the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House.

The George W. Bush administration[edit]

   Main article: Presidency of George W. Bush
   George W. Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004.

   Though his 2000 election had been the focus of intense controversy
   which led eventually to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Bush v. Gore
   where the court ruled 5–4 in the former's favor by siding with the
   State of Florida's official vote count, George W. Bush was sworn in as
   President on January 20, 2001. This made the 2000 election the third
   presidential election in which the electoral vote winner did not
   receive at least a plurality of the popular vote. Early in his term,
   Bush signed a $1.3 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the
   economy, but the wars in the Middle East as well as assorted domestic
   spending packages passed by the Republican Congress led to ballooning
   Federal deficits. Other laws enacted in his first term included the No
   Child Left Behind Act education reform bill in 2002, the Partial-Birth
   Abortion Ban Act in 2003 and the Medicare Prescription Drug,
   Improvement, and Modernization Act in 2004. The first eight months of
   his term in office were relatively uneventful; however, it had become
   clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an
   end. The year 2001 was plagued by a nine-month recession, witnessing
   the end of the boom psychology and performance, with output increasing
   only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures rising.

   On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial
   airliners and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the
   September 11 attacks, killing nearly 3,000 and injuring over 6,000
   people. Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   President Bush ordered all flights grounded and U.S. airspace remained
   closed for the rest of the week. An emergency bailout package for the
   airline industry was passed, and stocks fell dramatically when markets
   re-opened the following week. In response to the attacks, the Bush
   administration and Congress passed the controversial USA PATRIOT Act,
   aimed at enhancing security, and established the Department of Homeland
   Security, a mass consolidation of many federal agencies charged with
   investigation, intelligence, and emergency management. A new Terrorist
   Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists'
   financial resources but was discontinued after being revealed by The
   New York Times.^[151] Telecommunication usage by known and suspected
   terrorists was studied through the NSA electronic surveillance program.
   On October 7, 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan as part of a
   global War on Terrorism, aimed at rooting out al-Qaeda, the Taliban,
   and other terrorist organizations.^[152]

   In mid-2002, Bush announced that Iraq possessed chemical and nuclear
   weapons and posed a "clear and present danger" to stability in the
   Middle East. Plans for a full-scale military invasion of the country
   began amid widespread controversy. Antiwar protests occurred around the
   US and numerous other countries, mostly carried out by left-wing
   organizations, but some on the right and various military and
   diplomatic figures also doubted the wisdom of this venture. Regardless,
   the invasion of Iraq commenced on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi Army
   disintegrated without much resistance and within three weeks, US troops
   entered Baghdad to an overjoyed mob of Iraqi civilians who proceeded to
   tear down the giant statue of Saddam Hussein in the middle of the city.
   Bush announced on May 1, 2003 from an aircraft carrier that major
   combat operations in Iraq were completed, with a "Mission Accomplished"
   banner serving as a backdrop. Although the war was initially popular, a
   guerrilla insurgency quickly began mostly by Al Qaeda operatives who
   had entered the country. Led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a wave of
   bombings and beheadings of captives occurred, including the highly
   publicized killing of government contractor Nick Berg. Zarqawi was
   killed by US troops in 2005. Ineffective policing strategies led to a
   mounting death toll among soldiers, but eventually in 2007 a campaign
   known as "The Surge" began where the US Army launched a large-scale
   anti-terrorism offensive. Along with the help of Iraqi locals unhappy
   with the destruction caused by (largely foreigner) Al Qaeda agents, the
   surge resulted in the end of most major violence in the country. Late
   in 2003, Hussein was captured, and was subsequently put to trial before
   the Iraqi people and executed in 2006.

   Meanwhile, the economy recovered from the early 2000s economic
   recession, with GDP growth rising to 7% in the middle of 2003, with
   continued growth through the mid-2000s. The unemployment rate peaked at
   6% in 2003, before falling in 2004 and 2005, and dropping below 5% in
   2006 and 2007.^[6]

   George W. Bush was re-elected in November 2004, defeating Democratic
   contender John Kerry in the electoral vote, and receiving 50.7% of the
   popular vote against John Kerry's 48.3%. Republicans also made gains in
   both houses of Congress. Bush's reelection was assured by support for
   the War On Terror, the dour Kerry's lack of appeal to his voter base,
   and the excessive attacks made on the president by the Democrat left,
   which helped turn public opinion against them. In addition, it came out
   that Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, had participated in antiwar protests
   after returning home in 1970, including throwing away his medals.

   Some major acts in Bush's second term included the Energy Policy Act of
   2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity
   Act, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program. After seeing high approval
   ratings for much of his first term,^[153]^[154] Bush's popularity
   plummeted to record lows in his second term, due to his handling of the
   prolonged Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2008 financial crisis.
   Bush was succeeded on January 20, 2009 by a Democratic president,
   Barack Obama.

The Democratic Congress[edit]

   Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the U.S. House of
   Representatives, 2007–2011

   Democrats swept to victory in the 2006 elections, making Nancy Pelosi
   Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the first woman
   in that position, and electing record numbers of women and minorities.
   Upon winning the elections, the Democrats drew up a 100-Hour Plan of
   policy proposals upon assuming power in Congress. Major components of
   the plan included a pay-as-you-go plan for reducing the deficit;
   enacting the 9/11 Commission recommendations; increasing the federal
   minimum wage to $7.25 an hour; allowing the government to negotiate
   directly with pharmaceutical companies to secure lower drug prices for
   Medicare patients; and ending large tax subsidies for big oil companies
   to help foster energy independence.^[155]

   The 110th Congress did little to change the Iraq War except to pass a
   non-binding resolution against President Bush's troop surge. In
   addition, the House passed a $124 billion emergency spending measure
   for war funding with the stipulation of a phased troop withdrawal.
   President Bush vetoed the bill because of the proposal of scaling down
   forces, making this the second veto of his term.

   During the months of May–June 2007, Ted Kennedy and other senators
   co-sponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. The
   purpose of this bill called for immigration reform under the intent of
   bringing amnesty and citizenship. On June 28 the Senate voted 53–45 for
   cloture, with 60 votes needed, spelling the end to the 2007 Immigration
   Bill.

Financial crisis and recession[edit]

   In 2007, while U.S. unemployment dropped to its lowest level since the
   year 2000, the housing bubble reached its peak and economic growth
   slowed down, and by December 2007, the United States entered recession.
   By mid-2008, property values and the values of other assets plummeted,
   and the stock market crashed in October 2008, spurred by a lack of
   investor confidence as the liquidity of assets began to evaporate. With
   the decline in wealth and the lack of investor and consumer confidence,
   growth and economic activity came to a screeching halt and the job
   growth of previous years was soon wiped out, with mass layoffs and
   unemployment rising rapidly in late 2008, and continuing into 2009.

   Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told a federal commission in
   November 2009, "As a scholar of the Great Depression, I honestly
   believe that September and October of 2008 was the worst financial
   crisis in global history, including the Great Depression." Of the 13
   most important U.S. financial institutions, "12 were at risk of failure
   within a period of a week or two".^[156]

   The Federal Reserve and the Treasury cooperated by pouring trillions
   into a financial system that had frozen up worldwide. They rescued many
   of the large financial corporations from bankruptcy – with the
   exception of Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt – and took government
   control of insurance giant AIG, mortgage banks Fannie Mae and Freddie
   Mac, and both General Motors and Chrysler.^[157]

   In October 2008, Bush sought, and Congress passed, the Emergency
   Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as the "bank
   bailout") with the goal of protecting the U.S. financial system from
   complete collapse in the wake of the late-2000s recession, which
   brought significant declines in the stock market. The bill provided
   federal government guarantees of up to $700 billion to troubled
   financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program
   (TARP). By 2010, only a fraction of that money was ever spent, as banks
   were able to quickly repay loans from the federal government or ended
   up never needing the money.

   Meanwhile unemployment doubled to nearly 10%, with states such as
   California and Michigan especially hard hit. While the stock market
   rebounded by 2011, and corporate profits had recovered, unemployment
   remained over 9% into 2011. The recession was worldwide, with Europe
   and Japan hard hit, while China, India and Canada fared much better.

The Obama administration[edit]

   Obama sworn in as the 44th President of the United States
   Main articles: United States presidential election, 2008, United States
   presidential election, 2012 and Presidency of Barack Obama

   The nation went into the 2008 election cycle having a Republican
   president^[158] and Democratic congress^[159] both with extremely low
   approval ratings. Although New York Senator and former First Lady
   Hillary Clinton was generally believed to be the presumptive Democrat
   nominee, she faced a challenge from Barack Obama, the junior Senator
   from Illinois and a "dark horse" unknown outside his state. Obama's
   support suddenly rose as Hillary's dropped, and in May, she announced
   the termination of her presidential campaign. On the Republican side,
   Arizona Senator John McCain emerged as the party's nominee. Both
   candidates attracted considerable controversy. Obama was extremely
   inexperienced, having never even served a full six-year Senate term,
   and allegations came up of his ties to leftist groups and individuals,
   including Weather Underground founder William Ayers, who had been
   wanted for plotting to bomb government buildings during the Vietnam
   War. Also, it came out that he had attended for years a predominately
   black church who's pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, had been videotaped
   making anti-white comments. In order to quell concerns over Obama's
   greenness, he chose as his running mate veteran Delaware Senator Joe
   Biden, who had himself made numerous bids for the White House since the
   1980s. It was also alleged that the Illinois Senator had not been born
   in Hawaii as he claimed, but actually in Kenya (his father's homeland),
   making him ineligible to be president, but this could not be proven
   with certainty. Meanwhile, John McCain also attracted controversy due
   to his age and physical problems from years of captivity in North
   Vietnam, during which time he had been mentally and physically abused.
   The Arizona Senator chose for his running mate Alaska Governor Sarah
   Palin, who had many of the same problems as Obama with lack of
   experience. Although Palin rallied the GOP base, she had the exact
   opposite effect on the Democrat left, who promptly launched into a
   barrage of vicious attacks on her. In the end however, despite her
   popularity with conservatives, Palin could not overcome her own
   greenness as well as the question of whether she should be this close
   to the Oval Office given McCain's age and physical problems. Obama
   successfully played his card of being a Washington outsider (the
   opposite of Hillary Clinton and John McCain) as well as his youth and
   mixed-race background. He also benefited from a highly sympathetic
   media. McCain also harmed his reputation with the GOP base due to being
   notoriously inconsistent and seen as too willing to compromise with
   Senate Democrats.^[160] On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated McCain 365
   to 173 in the electoral vote and 52.9% to 45.7% in the popular vote to
   become the 44th President of the United States, making history in
   becoming the first African-American to be elected to the highest
   executive office. Obama and Biden were inaugurated on January 20, 2009.
   Part of the strong showing came from a surge of support from younger
   voters, African Americans, Hispanics and independents. Democrats made
   further gains in Congress, adding to the majorities they had won in
   2006.^[161]

   Obama's early policy decisions addressed a continuing global financial
   crisis^[162] and have included changes in tax policies, foreign policy
   initiatives and the phasing out of detention of prisoners at the
   Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba.^[163] In response to the
   deepening recession, Obama signed into law the American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act of 2009, a bill aimed at stimulating the economy which
   provided $787 billion in federal funds for tax relief, as well as
   significant investments in infrastructure improvements, social welfare
   programs, education programs, healthcare, and housing. Other
   legislative achievements during his term include the Patient Protection
   and Affordable Care Act which made sweeping reforms to the U.S.
   healthcare system, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
   Protection Act which implemented several new financial regulations to
   prevent another major financial crisis, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell
   Repeal Act.

   In foreign policy, President Obama withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in
   large numbers, bringing the Iraq War to an end in December 2011. At the
   same time, he also increased troop levels in the Afghanistan War.^[164]
   Early in his presidency, he successfully negotiated the New START
   treaty with Russia, which made significant reductions in their nuclear
   arsenals. The U.S. also maintains ongoing talks, led by Secretary of
   State Hillary Clinton, with North Korea over its nuclear weapons
   program, as well as with Israel and the Palestinian Authority over a
   two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In May 2011,
   President Obama announced in a televised speech to the nation that
   al-Qaeda leader and culprit behind many deadly acts of terrorism
   (including the September 11 attacks) Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S.
   forces at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

   Although the recession reached bottom in June 2009 and began to move up
   again, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic
   recovery. The Republicans – who stood in opposition to President
   Obama's policies that were being implemented – won control of the House
   of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and reduced the Democratic
   majority in the Senate in the 2010 midterm elections.^[165]

   Under the new Congress, which had a Republican House and a Democratic
   Senate, President Obama and Congress clashed for months over whether or
   not to raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to extend the payroll
   tax cuts for middle-income citizens that Obama signed into law. After
   months of heated debate, the debt ceiling was ultimately raised and the
   tax cuts extended. However, Obama's approval ratings continued to hover
   at around 46%,^[166] while Congress had an even lower approval rating
   of 11%.^[167]

   In November 2012, Obama was reelected President, defeating his
   Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in
   the Electoral College by 332 to 206 and in the popular vote by 51.06%
   to 47.21%.
