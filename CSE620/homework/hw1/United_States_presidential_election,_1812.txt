   James Madison
   Democratic-Republican
                            Elected President

                            James Madison
                            Democratic-Republican

   The United States presidential election of 1812 was the 7th quadrennial
   presidential election. It was held from Friday, October 30 to
   Wednesday, December 2, 1812. It took place in the shadow of the War of
   1812. It featured an intriguing competition between incumbent
   Democratic-Republican President James Madison and a dissident
   Democratic-Republican, DeWitt Clinton, nephew of Madison's late Vice
   President, George Clinton. The Federalist opposition threw their
   support behind Clinton. Nonetheless, Madison was re-elected with 50.4
   percent of the popular vote, making the 1812 election the closest up to
   that point in history.

Background[edit]

   Residual military conflict resulting from the Napoleonic Wars in Europe
   had been steadily worsening throughout James Madison's first term, with
   the British and the French both ignoring the neutrality rights of the
   United States at sea and seizing American ships, looking for supposed
   British deserters in a practice known as impressment. The British
   provided additional provocations by impressing American seamen,
   maintaining forts within United States territory in the Northwest, and
   supporting American Indians at war with the United States in both the
   Northwest and Southwest.

   Meanwhile, expansionists in the south and west of the United States
   coveted British Canada and Spanish Florida and wanted to use British
   provocations as a pretext to seize both areas. The pressure steadily
   built, and the United States declared war on the United Kingdom on June
   12, 1812. This occurred after Madison had been nominated by the
   Democratic-Republicans, but before the Federalists had made their
   nomination.

Nominations[edit]

Democratic-Republican Party nomination[edit]

   Democratic-Republican candidates:
     *

                                  President
                                James Madison
                                 of Virginia
     *

                           Mayor and Lt. Governor
                               DeWitt Clinton
                                 of New York
     *

                               Vice President
                               George Clinton
                                 of New York
                               (Died April 20)

   Many Democratic-Republicans in the Northern states were unhappy over
   the perceived dominance of the Presidency by the state of Virginia,
   three of the last four Presidents having been Virginians, and wished to
   instead nominate one of their own rather than renominate Madison.
   Initially these hopes were pinned upon Vice President George Clinton,
   but by this time his health was beginning to fail him and, combined
   with his age at 72, his support was made shoddy at best. George would
   be felled by a heart attack on April 20. Before his death his nephew,
   DeWitt Clinton, would be considered their preferred candidate to move
   against Madison.

   Hoping to forestall a serious movement against incumbent President
   James Madison and a division of the Democratic-Republican Party, some
   proposed making DeWitt Clinton the nominee for the Vice Presidency,
   taking the same office his uncle now held. DeWitt was not opposed to
   the offer, but preferred to wait until after the New York caucus to
   finalize his decision which due to delays would not be held until after
   the Congressional Caucus had met. Early caucuses were also held in the
   states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, both which pledged their support
   to Madison. On May 18 a Democratic-Republican Congressional nominating
   caucus was held, and James Madison was formally nominated as the
   candidate of his party, though divisions were quite apparent; only 86
   of the 134 Democratic-Republican Senators and Congressmen had
   participated in the caucus. Seeking a Northerner for a running mate and
   with DeWitt Clinton remaining aloof, the caucus chose Governor New
   Hampshire John Langdon to balance the ticket. However Langdon declined
   due to his advanced age, at the time 70 years. A second caucus was
   called which nominated Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts for the
   Vice Presidency, though he was not much younger than Langdon at 68.

   However on May 29, the New York caucus voted to nominate DeWitt Clinton
   for the Presidency near unanimously. Clinton's now open candidacy was
   opposed by many who, while not friends of James Madison, feared that
   Clinton was now apt to tear the Democratic-Republican party asunder.
   The matter of how to conduct his campaign also became a major problem
   for Clinton, especially with regards to the war with the British after
   June 12. Many of Clinton's supporters were war-hawks who advocated for
   more extreme measures so as to force the British into negotiations
   favorable to the United States, while DeWitt also knew he would have to
   appeal to Federalists to win, who were almost wholly opposed to the
   war.^[1]

Federalist nomination[edit]

   Federalist candidates:
     *

                           Mayor and Lt. Governor
                               DeWitt Clinton
                                 of New York
     *

                     Chief Justice of the United States
                                John Marshall
                                 of Virginia
                            (Declined to Contest)

   Before Clinton had entered the race as an alternative to President
   Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall was a favorite for the Federalist
   nomination, a relatively popular figure who could carry much of the
   Northeast while potentially taking with him Virginia and North
   Carolina. However with Clinton in the race they could no longer count
   on the vote of New York being in their column, possibly throwing the
   election into the Democratic-Republican dominated House of
   Representatives where Madison would almost assuredly be elected.

   In the face of these facts, the Federalist party considered for a time
   endorsing Clinton's candidacy, but at their Caucus in September it was
   decided that the party simply would not field a candidate that year and
   did not endorse Clinton. Though there was much support among the
   Federalists for Clinton, it was felt that openly endorsing him as the
   Party's choice for President would damage his chances in states where
   the Federalists remained unpopular, and drive away
   Democratic-Republicans who would normally be supportive of his
   candidacy. A Federalist caucus in Pennsylvania would chose to nominate
   Jared Ingersoll, the Attorney General of the state, as Clinton's
   running-mate, a move Clinton decided to support considering the
   importance of Pennsylvania's electors.^[2]

Straight-Federalist nomination[edit]

   Straight-Federalist candidate:
     *

                     Former Ambassador to Great Britain
                                 Rufus King
                                 of New York

   While many Federalists were supportive of DeWitt Clinton's candidacy,
   others were not so keen, skeptical of Clinton's positions regarding the
   war and other matters. Rufus King, a former Ambassador and Congressman,
   had led an effort at the September Caucus to nominate a Federalist
   ticket for the election that year, though he was ultimately
   unsuccessful. Still, some wished to enter King's name into the race
   under the Federalist label, and while very little came of it, in two
   states it caused problems for the Clinton campaign.

   In the case of Virginia, Clinton was rejected entirely by the state
   Federalist Party, which instead chose to nominate Rufus King for
   President and William Richardson Davie for Vice President. The ticket
   would acquire about 27% of the vote in the state. In New York, with the
   Federalists having gained control of the state legislature that summer,
   it was planned that the Federalists would nominate a slate pledged to
   Rufus King now that they had the majority. However, a Coalition of
   Democratic-Republicans and Federalists would defeat the motion and
   succeed in nominating a slate pledged to Clinton.^[3]

General election[edit]

Campaign[edit]

   Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning
   candidate in each county. Shades of blue are for Madison
   (Democratic-Republican) and shades of yellow are for Clinton
   (Federalist).

   Clinton continued his regional campaigning, anti-war in a Northeast
   most harmed by the war, and pro-war in the South and West. Although the
   Federalists made gains in Congress and although Clinton did better than
   any Federalist candidate since Adams, taking New York and New Jersey,
   Madison still won the Presidency by a comfortable margin. Clintonite
   Democratic-Republicans in many states refused to work with their
   Federalist counterparts (notably in Pennsylvania) and Clinton was
   generally regarded by most as the Federalist candidate, though he was
   not formally nominated by them.^[4] Madison was the first of just four
   presidents in US history to win re-election with a lower percentage of
   the electoral vote than in their prior elections, as Madison won 69.3%
   of the electoral vote in 1808, but only won 58.7% of the electoral vote
   in 1812. The other three are Woodrow Wilson in 1916, Franklin D.
   Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944 and Barack Obama in 2012. Additionally,
   Madison was the first of only five presidents to win re-election with a
   smaller percentage of the popular vote than in prior elections,
   although in 1812, only 6 of the 18 states chose electors by popular
   vote. The other four are Andrew Jackson in 1832, Grover Cleveland in
   1892, FDR in '40 and '44 and Obama in '12.
