Area[edit]

   From 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as
   9,372,610 km^2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land + inland water only). The listed
   total area changed to 9,629,091 km^2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (Great
   Lakes area and coastal waters added), to 9,631,418 km^2
   (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 km^2 (3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006,
   and to 9,826,630 km^2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007 (territorial waters
   added). Currently, the CIA World Factbook gives 9,826,675 km^2
   (3,794,100 sq mi),^[2] the United Nations Statistics Division gives
   9,629,091 km^2 (3,717,813 sq mi),^[3] and the Encyclopædia Britannica
   gives 9,522,055 km^2 (3,676,486 sq mi).^[4]

   By total area (water as well as land), the United States is either
   slightly larger or smaller than the People's Republic of China, making
   it the world's third or fourth largest country. China and the United
   States are smaller than Russia and Canada in total area, but are larger
   than Brazil. By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States
   is the world's third largest country, after Russia and China, with
   Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country
   by total area depends on two factors: (1) The validity of China's claim
   on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. Both these territories are
   also claimed by India, so are not counted; and (2) How US calculates
   its own surface area. Since the initial publishing of the World
   Factbook, the CIA has updated the total area of United States a number
   of times.^[5]

General characteristics[edit]

   A satellite composite image of the contiguous United States. Deciduous
   vegetation and grasslands prevail in the east, transitioning to
   prairies, boreal forests, and the Rockies in the west, and deserts in
   the southwest. In the northeast, the coasts of the Great Lakes and
   Atlantic seaboard host much of the country's population.

   The United States shares land borders with Canada (to the north) and
   Mexico (to the south), and a territorial water border with Russia in
   the northwest, and two territorial water borders in the southeast
   between Florida and Cuba, and Florida and the Bahamas. The contiguous
   forty-eight states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the
   west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the
   southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Bering
   Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north, while Hawaii
   lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.

   Forty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and
   Mexico; this group is referred to, with varying precision and
   formality, as the continental or contiguous United States, and as the
   Lower 48. Alaska, which is not included in the term contiguous United
   States, is at the northwestern end of North America, separated from the
   Lower 48 by Canada.

   The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. The capital
   city, Washington, District of Columbia, is a federal district located
   on land donated by the state of Maryland. (Virginia had also donated
   land, but it was returned in 1847.) The United States also has overseas
   territories with varying levels of independence and organization.

Physiographic divisions[edit]

   Main article: United States physiographic region
   Mount McKinley, Alaska, the highest point in North America at 20,237 ft
   (6,168 m).

   The eastern United States has a varied topography. A broad, flat
   coastal plain lines the Atlantic and Gulf shores from the Texas-Mexico
   border to New York City, and includes the Florida peninsula. Areas
   further inland feature rolling hills and temperate forests. The
   Appalachian Mountains form a line of low mountains separating the
   eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Basin.

   The five Great Lakes are located in the north-central portion of the
   country, four of them forming part of the border with Canada. The
   southeast United States contain subtropical forests and, near the gulf
   coast, mangrove wetlands, especially in Florida. West of the
   Appalachians lies the Mississippi River basin and two large eastern
   tributaries, the Ohio River and the Tennessee River. The Ohio and
   Tennessee Valleys and the Midwest consist largely of rolling hills and
   productive farmland, stretching south to the Gulf Coast.

   The Great Plains lie west of the Mississippi River and east of the
   Rocky Mountains. A large portion of the country's agricultural products
   are grown in the Great Plains. Before their general conversion to
   farmland, the Great Plains were noted for their extensive grasslands,
   from tallgrass prairie in the eastern plains to shortgrass steppe in
   the western High Plains. Elevation rises gradually from less than a few
   hundred feet near the Mississippi River to more than a mile high in the
   High Plains. The generally low relief of the plains is broken in
   several places, most notably in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which
   form the U.S. Interior Highlands, the only major mountainous region
   between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.^[6]^[7]

   The Great Plains come to an abrupt end at the Rocky Mountains. The
   Rocky Mountains form a large portion of the Western U.S., entering from
   Canada and stretching nearly to Mexico. The Rocky Mountain region is
   the highest region of the United States by average elevation. The Rocky
   Mountains generally contain fairly mild slopes and wider peaks compared
   to some of the other great mountain ranges, with a few exceptions (such
   as the Teton Mountains in Wyoming and the Sawatch Range in Colorado).
   The highest peaks of the Rockies are found in Colorado, the tallest
   peak being Mount Elbert at 14,440 ft (4,400 m). The Rocky Mountains
   contain some of the most spectacular, and well known scenery in the
   world. In addition, instead of being one generally continuous and solid
   mountain range, it is broken up into a number of smaller, intermittent
   mountain ranges, forming a large series of basins and valleys.

   West of the Rocky Mountains lies the Intermontane Plateaus (also known
   as the Intermountain West), a large, arid desert lying between the
   Rockies and the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges. The large southern
   portion, known as the Great Basin, consists of salt flats, drainage
   basins, and many small north-south mountain ranges. The Southwest is
   predominantly a low-lying desert region. A portion known as the
   Colorado Plateau, centered around the Four Corners region, is
   considered to have some of the most spectacular scenery in the world.
   It is accentuated in such national parks as Grand Canyon, Arches, Mesa
   Verde National Park and Bryce Canyon, among others.
   The Grand Canyon from Moran Point. The Grand Canyon is among the most
   famous locations in the country.

   The Intermontane Plateaus come to an end at the Cascade Range and the
   Sierra Nevada. The Cascades consist of largely intermittent, volcanic
   mountains, many rising prominently from the surrounding landscape. The
   Sierra Nevada, further south, is a high, rugged, and dense mountain
   range. It contains the highest point in the contiguous 48 states, Mount
   Whitney (14,505 ft or 4,421 m)[1] It is located at the boundary between
   California's Inyo and Tulare counties, just 84.6 mi or 136.2 km
   west-northwest of the lowest point in North America at Badwater in
   Death Valley National Park, at 282 ft or 86 m below sea level.

   These areas contain some spectacular scenery as well, as evidenced by
   such national parks as Yosemite and Mount Rainier. West of the Cascades
   and Sierra Nevada is a series of valleys, such as the Central Valley in
   California and the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Along the coast is a
   series of low mountain ranges known as the Pacific Coast Ranges. Much
   of the Pacific Northwest coast is inhabited by some of the densest
   vegetation outside of the Tropics, and also the tallest trees in the
   world (the Redwoods).

   Alaska contains some of the most dramatic and untapped scenery in the
   country. Tall, prominent mountain ranges rise up sharply from broad,
   flat tundra plains. On the islands off the south and southwest coast
   are many volcanoes. Hawaii, far to the south of Alaska in the Pacific
   Ocean, is a chain of tropical, volcanic islands, popular as a tourist
   destination for many from East Asia and the mainland United States.

Physiographic regions[edit]

   A physiographical map of the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. The map
   indicates the age of the exposed surface as well as the type of
   terrain.

   The geography of the United States varies across their immense area.
   Within the continental U.S., eight distinct physiographic divisions
   exist, though each is composed of several smaller physiographic
   subdivisions.^[8] These major divisions are:
     * Laurentian Upland - part of the Canadian Shield that extends into
       the northern United States Great Lakes area.

     * Atlantic Plain - the coastal regions of the eastern and southern
       parts includes the continental shelf, the Atlantic Coast and the
       Gulf Coast.

     * Appalachian Highlands - lying on the eastern side of the United
       States, it includes the Appalachian Mountains, the Watchung
       Mountains, the Adirondacks and New England province originally
       containing the Great Eastern Forest.

     * Interior Plains - part of the interior contentintal United States,
       it includes much of what is called the Great Plains.

     * Interior Highlands - also part of the interior contentintal United
       States, this division includes the Ozark Plateau.

     * Rocky Mountain System - one branch of the Cordilleran system lying
       far inland in the western states.

     * Intermontane Plateaus - also divided into the Columbia Plateau, the
       Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province, it is a system
       of plateaus, basins, ranges and gorges between the Rocky and
       Pacific Mountain Systems. It is the setting for the Grand Canyon,
       the Great Basin and Death Valley.

     * Pacific Mountain System - the coastal mountain ranges and features
       in the west coast of the United States.

   Much of the central United States is covered by relatively flat, arable
   land. This aerial photo was taken over northern Ohio.

   The Atlantic coast of the United States is low, with minor exceptions.
   The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to
   crustal deformations which in very early geological time gave a
   beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian mountain system.
   This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in
   Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to
   moderate or low relief. It owes its present day altitude either to
   renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the
   most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this
   coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern
   crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an
   encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern
   section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land
   upon the sea.

   While the Atlantic coast is relatively low, the Pacific coast is, with
   few exceptions, hilly or mountainous. This coast has been defined
   chiefly by geologically recent crustal deformations, and hence still
   preserves a greater relief than that of the Atlantic. The low Atlantic
   coast and the hilly or mountainous Pacific coast foreshadow the leading
   features in the distribution of mountains within the United States.

   The east coast Appalachian system, originally forest covered, is
   relatively low and narrow and is bordered on the southeast and south by
   an important coastal plain. The Cordilleran system on the western side
   of the continent is lofty, broad and complicated having two branches,
   the Rocky Mountain System and the Pacific Mountain System. In between
   these mountain systems lie the Intermontaine Plateaus. Both the
   Columbia River and Colorado River rise far inland near the easternmost
   members of the Cordilleran system, and flow through plateaus and
   intermontaine basins to the ocean. Heavy forests cover the northwest
   coast, but elsewhere trees are found only on the higher ranges below
   the Alpine region. The intermontane valleys, plateaus and basins range
   from treeless to desert with the most arid region being in the
   southwest.

   The Laurentian Highlands, the Interior Plains and the Interior
   Highlands lie between the two coasts, stretching from the Gulf of
   Mexico northward, far beyond the national boundary, to the Arctic
   Ocean. The central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of
   land into a Canadian and a United States portion. It is from the United
   States side, that the great Mississippi system discharges southward to
   the Gulf of Mexico. The upper Mississippi and some of the Ohio basin is
   the semi-arid prairie region, with trees originally only along the
   watercourses. The uplands towards the Appalachians were included in the
   great eastern forested area, while the western part of the plains has
   so dry a climate that its native plant life is scanty, and in the south
   it is practically barren.

   Elevation extremes:
     * Lowest point: Death Valley, Inyo County, California −282 ft (−86 m)
       below sea level
     * Highest point: Mount McKinley, Denali Borough, Alaska +20,237 ft
       (6,168 m) above sea level

Climate[edit]

   Main article: Climate of the United States
   The climate zones of the lower 48 United States.
   A map of average precipitation across the continental US.

   Due to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United
   States contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is
   temperate in most areas, subtropical in the Deep South, tropical in
   Hawaii and southern Florida, polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great
   Plains west of the 100th meridian, Mediterranean in coastal California
   and arid in the Great Basin. Its comparatively favorable agricultural
   climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power,
   with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions, a
   general lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly temperate climate
   that receives adequate precipitation.

   The main influence on U.S. weather is the polar jet stream, which
   brings in large low pressure systems from the northern Pacific Ocean.
   The Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains pick up most of
   the moisture from these systems as they move eastward. Greatly
   diminished by the time they reach the High Plains, much of the moisture
   has been sapped by the orographic effect as it is forced over several
   mountain ranges.

   Once it moves over the Great Plains, uninterrupted flat land allows it
   to reorganize and can lead to major clashes of air masses. In addition,
   moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is often drawn northward. When
   combined with a powerful jet stream, this can lead to violent
   thunderstorms, especially during spring and summer. Sometimes during
   late winter and spring these storms can combine with another low
   pressure system as they move up the East Coast and into the Atlantic
   Ocean, where they intensify rapidly.

   These storms are known as Nor'easters and often bring widespread, heavy
   snowfall to the Mid-Atlantic and New England. The uninterrupted flat
   grasslands of the Great Plains also leads to some of the most extreme
   climate swings in the world. Temperatures can rise or drop rapidly and
   winds can be extreme, and the flow of heat waves or Arctic air masses
   often advance uninterrupted through the plains.

   The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are
   arid or semiarid regions that lie in the rain shadow of the Cascades
   and Sierra Nevada. Precipitation averages less than 15 inches (38 cm).
   The Southwest is a hot desert, with temperatures exceeding 100 °F
   (37.8 °C) for several weeks at a time in summer. The Southwest and the
   Great Basin are also affected by the monsoon from the Gulf of
   California from July–September, which brings localized but often severe
   thunderstorms to the region.

   Much of California consists of a Mediterranean climate, with sometimes
   excessive rainfall from October–April and nearly no rain the rest of
   the year. In the Pacific Northwest rain falls year-round, but is much
   heavier during winter and spring. The mountains of the west receive
   abundant precipitation and very heavy snowfall. The Cascades are one of
   the snowiest places in the world, with some places averaging over 600
   inches (1,524 cm) of snow annually, but the lower elevations closer to
   the coast receive very little snow.

   Another significant (but localized) weather effect is lake-effect snow
   that falls south and east of the Great Lakes, especially in the hilly
   portions of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and on the Tug Hill Plateau
   in New York. The lake effect dumped well over 5 feet (1.52 m) of snow
   in the area of Buffalo, New York throughout the 2006-2007 winter. The
   Wasatch Front and Wasatch Range in Utah can also receive significant
   lake effect accumulations from the Great Salt Lake.

Extremes[edit]

   In northern Alaska, tundra and arctic conditions predominate, and the
   temperature has fallen as low as −80 °F (−62.2 °C).^[9] On the other
   end of the spectrum, Death Valley, California once reached 134 °F
   (56.7 °C), the second-highest temperature ever recorded on Earth.^[10]

   On average, the mountains of the western states receive the highest
   levels of snowfall on Earth. The greatest annual snowfall level is at
   Mount Rainier in Washington, at 692 inches (1,758 cm); the record there
   was 1,122 inches (2,850 cm) in the winter of 1971–72. This record was
   broken by the Mt. Baker Ski Area in northwestern Washington which
   reported 1,140 inches (2,896 cm) of snowfall for the 1998-99 snowfall
   season. Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade
   Range are the Wasatch Mountains, near the Great Salt Lake, the San Juan
   Mountains in Colorado, and the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe.

   In the east, while snowfall does not approach western levels, the
   region near the Great Lakes and the mountains of the Northeast receive
   the most. Along the northwestern Pacific coast, rainfall is greater
   than anywhere else in the continental U.S., with Quinault Rainforest in
   Washington having an average of 137 inches (348 cm).^[11] Hawaii
   receives even more, with 460 inches (1,168 cm) measured annually on
   Mount Waialeale, in Kauai. The Mojave Desert, in the southwest, is home
   to the driest locale in the U.S. Yuma, Arizona, has an average of 2.63
   inches (6.7 cm) of precipitation each year.^[12]

   In central portions of the U.S., tornadoes are more common than
   anywhere else on Earth^[13] and touch down most commonly in the spring
   and summer. Deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year
   along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. The Appalachian
   region and the Midwest experience the worst floods, though virtually no
   area in the U.S. is immune to flooding. The Southwest has the worst
   droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have
   decimated the Anasazi people.^[14] The West is affected by large
   wildfires each year.

Natural disasters[edit]

   The United States is affected by a variety of natural disasters yearly.
   Although drought is rare, it has occasionally caused major disruption,
   such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942). Farmland failed throughout
   the Plains, entire regions were virtually depopulated, and dust storms
   ravaged the land.
   A powerful tornado near Dimmitt, Texas on June 2, 1995.

Tornadoes and Hurricanes[edit]

   The Great Plains and Midwest, due to the contrasting air masses, sees
   frequent severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks during spring and
   summer with around 1,000 tornadoes occurring each year.^[15] The strip
   of land from north Texas north to Kansas and Nebraska and east into
   Tennessee is known as Tornado Alley, where many houses have tornado
   shelters and many towns have tornado sirens.

   Hurricane are another natural disaster found in the US, which can hit
   anywhere along the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast as well as Hawaii
   in the Pacific Ocean. Particularly at risk are the central and southern
   Texas coasts, the area from southeastern Louisiana east to the Florida
   Panhandle, the east coast of Florida, and the Outer Banks of North
   Carolina, although any portion of the coast could be struck.

   Hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with a peak from
   mid-August through early October. Some of the more devastating
   hurricanes have included the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane
   Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The remnants of tropical
   cyclones from the Eastern Pacific also occasionally impact the western
   United States, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall.
   Total devastation in Gulfport, Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina
   in 2005.

Flooding[edit]

   Occasional severe flooding is experienced. There was the Great
   Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Great Flood of 1993, and widespread
   flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982-1983 El Niño event in the
   western United States. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere,
   and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous
   area, particularly the Southwest. Large stretches of desert shrub in
   the west can fuel the spread of wildfires. The narrow canyons of many
   mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the
   summer leads to sometimes devastating flash floods as well, while
   Nor'Easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the
   Northeast (although heavy snowstorms can occur almost anywhere).

Geologic[edit]

   The West Coast of the continental United States and areas of Alaska
   (including the Aleutian Islands, the Alaskan Peninsula and southern
   Alaskan coast) make up part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of
   heavy tectonic and volcanic activity that is the source of 90% of the
   world's earthquakes.^[citation needed] The American Northwest sees the
   highest concentration of active volcanoes in the United States, in
   Washington, Oregon and northern California along the Cascade Mountains.
   There are several active volcanoes located in the islands of Hawaii,
   including Kilauea in ongoing eruption since 1983, but they do not
   typically adversely affect the inhabitants of the islands. There has
   not been a major life-threatening eruption on the Hawaiian islands
   since the 17th century. Volcanic eruptions can occasionally be
   devastating, such as in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in
   Washington.

   The Ring of Fire makes California and southern Alaska particularly
   vulnerable to earthquakes. Earthquakes can cause extensive damage, such
   as the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake or the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake
   near Anchorage, Alaska. California is well known for seismic activity,
   and requires large structures to be earthquake resistant to minimize
   loss of life and property.^[citation needed] Outside of devastating
   earthquakes, California experiences minor earthquakes on a regular
   basis.

   There have been about 100 significant earthquakes annually from 2010 to
   2012. Past averages were 21 a year. This is believed to be due to the
   deep disposal of wastewater from fracking. None has exceeded a
   magnitude of 5.6, and no one has been killed.^[16]

Other Natural Disasters[edit]

   Other natural disasters include: tsunamis around Pacific Basin, mud
   slides in California, and forest fires in the western half of the
   contiguous U.S. Although drought is relatively rare, it has
   occasionally caused major economic and social disruption, such as
   during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942), which resulted in widespread crop
   failures and duststorms, beginning in the southern Great Plains and
   reaching to the Atlantic Ocean.

Public lands[edit]

   The United States holds many areas for the use and enjoyment of the
   public. These include National Parks, National Monuments, National
   Forests, Wilderness areas, and other areas. For lists of areas, see the
   following articles:
     * List of National Parks of the United States
     * List of National Natural Landmarks
     * List of U.S. National Forests
     * List of U.S. Wilderness Areas
     * List of miscellaneous U.S. public areas

Antipodes[edit]

   The antipodes of the continental United States are in the southern
   Indian Ocean, including the Kerguelen Islands (antipodal to the
   Montana–Saskatchewan–Alberta border) and the Amsterdam and Saint-Paul
   islands (antipodal to Colorado). All of Hawaii is antipodal to land,
   most of it to Botswana, apart from Niʻihau, which aligns with Namibia,
   and Kauai, which straddles the border. American Samoa is antipodal to
   Niger, near the town of Zinder. The northern coast of Alaska is
   antipodal to coastal Antarctica, from mid Queen Maud Land to Enderby
   Land.
