       Lovejoy, editor of the Alton Observer.
     * May 21, 1856: Sacking of Lawrence—Pro-Slavery forces enter
       Lawrence, Kansas to disarm residents and destroy the town's presses
       and the Free State Hotel.
     * October 16, 1859: Anti-slavery Pottawatomie Massacre—In response to
       the sacking of Lawrence, John Brown leads a group of abolitionists
       in the murders of five pro-slavery Kansas settlers.
     * April 14, 1865: Pro-slavery Abraham Lincoln assassination – Part of
       a conspiracy by Confederate supporters John Wilkes Booth, Lewis
       Powell and George Atzerodt to assassinate President Abraham
       Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State
       William Seward in Washington, D.C. to create chaos for the purpose
       of overthrowing the Federal Government. Booth succeeded in
       assassinating Lincoln at Ford's Theatre, Seward survived numerous
       stabbings by Powell who stabbed others as he was chased out of
       Seward's home, and Atzerodt failed to carry out the planned murder
       of Johnson. Booth was killed by soldiers when he failed to
       surrender. Eight conspirators were tried and convicted for their
       role in the conspiracy by a military tribunal, including Powell and
       Atzerodt. Four defendants were executed for their roles including
       Powell, Azterodt and Mary Surratt, the first woman ever to be
       hanged by the U.S. government.
     * May 4, 1886: Haymarket affair—An unknown person or persons at
       Haymarket Square in Chicago detonates a bomb during a labor rally,
       killing a police officer and prompting the police to open fire. In
       the mayhem, an undetermined number of civilians and seven more
       police officers were killed, mostly by the police shooting in
       response.
     * October 28, 1893: Carter Harrison assassination-Patrick Eugene
       Joseph Prendergast was upset that the Mayor of Chicago, Carter
       Harrison, Sr., advocated for the repeal of the 1890 Sherman Silver
       Purchase Act, seeing it as an action against the citizenry and
       acting under the influence of England, the Rothschild bankers of
       Europe, and Wall St. Prendergast imagined this as part of a larger
       conspiracy that betrayed the will of Jesus Christ. As a delusional
       newspaper man, he found himself unable to influence policy in
       Washington or Chicago and ultimately took it upon himself to change
       the course of history by assassinating the powerful mayor. He felt
       that his inevitable acquittal would establish a precedent wherein
       Christian law would be established throughout the city. Prendergast
       was found sane by a jury and hanged on July 14, 1894.^[3]

       the McNamara brothers, were found guilty.

       the son of the financier whose company served as Great Britain’s
       principal U.S. purchasing agent for munitions and other war
       supplies. Muenter was overpowered by Morgan in Morgan's Long Island

     * July 22, 1916: The Preparedness Day Bombing kills ten people and
       injures 40 in San Francisco. Two radical labor leaders, Warren K.

     * May 31, 1921: During the Tulsa race riot there were reports that

     * May 18, 1927: The Bath School disaster (bombings) killed 45 people
       and injured 58. Most of the victims were children in the second to
       sixth grades (7–12 years of age) attending the Bath Consolidated

       separatist group, responsible for 40 NYC attacks in this decade.
       The Jewish Defense League (JDL), which engaged in attacks against

       Wisconsin–Madison in protest of the Army Mathematics Research
       Center and the Vietnam War, killing one. Bombers Karleton

       planted the bomb.
     * November 21, 1970: Bombing of the City Hall of Portland, Oregon in
       an attempt to destroy the state's bronze Liberty Bell replica. The

       burned down two Marina Del Rey apartment buildings and threatened
       Los Angeles with a gas attack. His bomb defused at the Greyhound
       Bus station was the most powerful the LAPD bomb squad had handled
       up until that time. His personal vendetta against a judge and the

       exhibits. The room was sealed off and left unrepaired until the
       Statue of Liberty restoration project that began years later. FBI

       suspicious residents came out in droves to prevent the election of
       Rajneeshee candidates.. Health officials say that 751 people were
       sickened and more than 40 hospitalized. All but one of the
       establishments attacked went out of business. Investigators
       believed that similar attacks had previously been carried out in
