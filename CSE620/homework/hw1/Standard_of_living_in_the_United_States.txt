Standard of living in the United States

   Median gross annual household and personal income in 2005.^[1]^[2]^[3]
   Median Equivalised Household Income and GDP per Capita levels in
   selected developed nations.
   The growth in total US GDP vs median US household income.

   The standard of living in the United States is one of the top 20 in the
   world by the standards economists use as measures of standards of
   living. Per capita income is high but also less evenly distributed than
   in most other developed countries; as a result, the United States fares
   particularly well in measures of average material well being that do
   not place weight on equality aspects.

Measures[edit]

   On comprehensive measures such as the UN Human Development Index the
   United States is always in the top twenty, currently ranking 3rd. On
   the Human Poverty Index the United States ranked 17th, one rank below
   the United Kingdom and one rank above Ireland.^[4]

   On The Economist's quality-of-life index the United States ranked 13th,
   in between Finland and Canada, scoring 7.6 out of a possible 10. The
   highest given score of 8.3 was applied to Ireland. This particular
   index takes into account a variety of socio-economic variables
   including GDP per capita, life expectancy, political stability, family
   life, community life, gender equality, and job security.^[5]

   The homeownership rate is relatively high compared to other
   post-industrial nations. In 2005, 69% of Americans resided in their own
   homes, roughly the same percentage as in the United Kingdom, Belgium,
   Israel and Canada.^[6]^[7]^[8] Residents of the United States also
   enjoy a high access to consumer goods. Americans enjoy more cars and
   radios per capita than any other nation^[9] and more televisions and
   personal computers per capita than any other nation with more than 200
   million people.^[10]^[11]

Change over time[edit]

   From the 1930s up until 1980, the average American income (after taxes
   and inflation) tripled,^[12] which translated into higher living
   standards for the American
   population.^[13]^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18]^[18]^[19]^[20]^[21]^[22]^[23]
   ^[24]^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28]^[29] Between 1949 and 1969, real median
   family income grew by 99.3%.^[30] From 1946 to 1978, the standard of
   living for the average family more than doubled.^[31]

   Average family income (in real terms) more than doubled from 1945 up
   until the 1970s, while unemployment steadily fell until it reached 4%
   in the Sixties.^[32] Between 1949-50 and 1965–66, median family income
   (in constant 2009 dollars) rose from $25,814 to $43,614,^[33] and from
   1947 to 1960, consumer spending went up by a full 60%, and for the
   first time, as noted by Mary P. Ryan, “the majority of Americans would
   enjoy something called discretionary income, earnings that were secure
   and substantial enough to permit them to enter sectors of the
   marketplace that were once reserved for the affluent.”^[34]

   During the Sixties, median family incomes increased by over 33%, while
   per capita expenditures on recreation and meals grew by over 40%. From
   1959 to 1969, median family income (in 1984 dollars) increased from
   $19,300 to $26,700.^[35] By 1969, 79.6% of all households owned at
   least one car, 82.6% owned a refrigerator or freezer, 79% owned a black
   and white television set, 31.9% owned a color television set, and 70%
   owned a washing machine.^[36] Post-war prosperity also resulted in
   increased leisure time. By 1970, it was estimated that the average
   workingman in America had 140 days off work each year.^[37]

   As reported by the OECD in 1980, the American standard of living was
   the highest among the industrial countries. Out of the 85 million
   households in the United States, 64% owned their own living quarters,
   55% had at least two TV sets, and 51% had more than one vehicle. By
   1985, the US per capita income was $11,727, one of the highest among
   industrialized countries. By the mid-1980s, 98% of all households had a
   telephone service, 77% a washing machine, 45% a freezer, and 43% a
   dishwasher.^[38] By the 1990s, the average American standard of living
   was regarded as amongst the highest in the world.^[39]

Current[edit]

   The median income is $43,318 per household ($26,000 per household
   member)^[1] with 42% of households having two income earners.^[40]
   Meanwhile, the median income of the average American age 25+ was
   roughly $32,000^[2] ($39,000 if only counting those employed full-time
   between the ages of 25 to 64) in 2005.^[3] According to the CIA the
   gini index which measures income inequality (the higher the less equal
   the income distribution) was clocked at 45.0 in 2005,^[41] compared to
   32.0 in the European Union^[42] and 28.3 in Germany.^[43]
   “ The US has... a per capita GDP [PPP] of $42,000... The [recent]
     onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a
     "two-tier labor market"... Since 1975, practically all the gains in
     household income have gone to the top 20% of households... The rise in
     GDP in 2004 and 2005 was undergirded by substantial gains in labor
     productivity... Long-term problems include inadequate investment in
     economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an
     aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of
     family income in the lower economic groups.                            ”

   —CIA factbook on the US economy, 2005., ^[41]

   The United States has one of the widest rich-poor gaps of any
   high-income nation today, and that gap continues to grow.^[44] In
   recent times, some prominent economists including Alan Greenspan have
   warned that the widening rich-poor gap in the U.S. population is a
   problem that could undermine and destabilize the country's economy and
   standard of living stating that "The income gap between the rich and
   the rest of the US population has become so wide, and is growing so
   fast, that it might eventually threaten the stability of democratic
   capitalism itself".^[45]

Social class[edit]

   Main article: Social class in the United States

   Standard of living in the United States varies considerably with
   socio-economic status. The table below gives a summarization of
   prominent academic theories on the socio-economic stratification of the
   United States:
