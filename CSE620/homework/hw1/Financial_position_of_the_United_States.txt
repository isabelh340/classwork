   Net worth of the United States by sector as a fraction of GDP 1960-2008
   Assets of the United States as a fraction of GDP 1960-2008
   Liabilities of the United States as a fraction of GDP 1960-2009

   The financial position of the United States includes assets of at least
   $269.6 trillion (1576% of GDP) and debts of $145.8 trillion (852% of
   GDP) to produce a net worth of at least $123.8 trillion (723% of
   GDP,)^[a] as of Q1 2014.

   The U.S. increased the ratio of public and private debt from 152% GDP
   in 1980 to peak at 296% GDP in 2008, before falling to 279% GDP by Q2
   2011. The 2009-2011 decline was due to foreclosures and increased rates
   of household saving. There were significant declines in debt to GDP in
   each sector except the government, which ran large deficits to offset
   de-leveraging or debt reduction in other sectors.^[2]

   As of 2009, there was $50.7 trillion of debt owed by US households,
   businesses, and governments, representing more than 3.5 times the
   annual gross domestic product of the United States.^[3] As of the first
   quarter of 2010, domestic financial assets^[b] totaled $131 trillion
   and domestic financial liabilities $106 trillion.^[4] Tangible assets
   in 2008 (such as real estate and equipment) for selected sectors^[c]
   totaled an additional $56.3 trillion.^[6]

Net worth (or equity)[edit]

   Net worth is the sum of assets (both financial and tangible) minus
   liabilities for a given sector.^[7] Net worth is a valuable measure of
   creditworthiness and financial health since the calculation includes
   both financial obligations and the capacity to service those
   obligations.^[8]

   The net worth of the United States and its economic sectors has
   remained relatively consistent over time. The total net worth of the
   United States remained between 4.5 and 6 times GDP from 1960 until the
   2000s, when it rose as high as 6.64 times GDP in 2006, principally due
   to an increase in the net worth of US households in the midst of the
   United States housing bubble. The net worth of the United States
   sharply declined to 5.2 times GDP by the end of 2008 due to declines in
   the values of US corporate equities and real estate in the wake of the
   subprime mortgage crisis and the global financial crisis. Between 2008
   and 2009, the net worth of US households had recovered from a low of
   3.55 times GDP to 3.75 times GDP, while nonfinancial business fell from
   1.37 times GDP to 1.22 times GDP.^[6]

   The net worth of American households and non-profits constitutes
   three-quarters of total United States net worth - in 2008, 355% of GDP.
   Since 1960, US households have consistently held this position,
   followed by nonfinancial business (137% of GDP in 2008) and state and
   local governments (50% of GDP in 2008). The financial sector has
   hovered around zero net worth since 1960, reflecting its leverage,
   while the federal government has fluctuated from a net worth of -7% of
   GDP in 1946, a high of 6% of GDP in 1974, to -32% of GDP in 2008.^[6]

   The Federal Reserve issues routine reports on the flows and levels of
   debt in the United States. As of the first quarter of 2010, the Federal
   Reserve estimated that total public and private debt owed by American
   households, businesses, and government totaled $50 trillion, or roughly
   $175,000 per American and 3.5 times GDP.^[12]

   Interest payments on debt by US households, businesses, governments,
   and nonprofits totaled $3.29 trillion in 2008. The financial sector
   paid an additional $178.6 billion in interest on deposits.^[13]

   In 1946, the total US debt-to-GDP ratio was 150%, with two-thirds of
   that held by the federal government. Since 1946, the federal
   government's debt-to-GDP ratio has since fallen by nearly half, to
   54.8% of GDP in 2009. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the financial sector, by
   contrast, has increased from 1.35% in 1946 to 109.5% of GDP in 2009.
   The ratio for households has risen nearly as much, from 15.84% of GDP
   to 95.4% of GDP.^[3]

   In April 2011, International Monetary Fund said that, "The US lacks a
   "credibility strategy" to stabilise its mounting public debt, posing a
   small but significant risk of a new global economic crisis.^[14]

Financial sector[edit]

   In 1946, the US financial sector owed $3 billion of debt, or 1.35% of
   GDP. By 2009 this had increased to $15.6 trillion, or 109.5% of
   GDP.^[3]

   Most debt owed by the US financial sector is in the form of federal
   government sponsored enterprise (GSE) issues and agency-backed
   securities.^[15] This refers to securities guaranteed and mediated by
   federal agencies and GSEs such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie
   Mac, among others. This group also includes the mortgage pools that are
   used as collateral in collateralized mortgage obligations.^[16] The
   proportion of financial sector debt owed in the form of GSE and
   federally related mortgage pools has remained relatively constant -
   $863 million or 47% of total financial sector debt in 1946 was in such
   instruments; this has increased to 57% of financial sector debt in
   2009, although this now represents over $8 trillion.^[15]

   Bonds represent the next largest part of financial sector debt. In
   1946, bonds represented 6% of financial sector debt, but by 1953 this
   proportion had risen to 24%. This remained relatively constant until
   the late 1970s; bonds fell to 14% of financial sector debt in
   1981.^[15] This coincided with Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's
   strategy of combating stagflation by raising the federal funds rate; as
   a result the prime rate peaked at 21.5%, making financing through
   credit markets prohibitively expensive.^[16] Bonds recovered in the
   1980s, representing approximately 25% of financial sector debt
   throughout the 1990s; however, between 2000 and 2009, bonds issued by
   the financial sector had increased to 37% of financial sector debt, or
   $5.8 trillion.^[15]

   Bonds and GSE/federal agency-backed issues represent all but 12% of
   financial sector debt in 2009.^[15]

Households and non-profits[edit]

   In 1946, US households and non-profits owed $35 billion of debt or
   15.8% of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $13.6 trillion or 95.4%
   of GDP.^[3] Home mortgage debt in 1946 represented 66.5% of household
   debt; consumer credit represented another 24%. By 2009, home mortgage
   debt had risen to 76% of household debt and consumer credit had fallen
   to 18.22%.^[17]

Nonfinancial business[edit]

   In 1946, US nonfinancial businesses owed $63.9 billion of debt or 28.8%
   of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $10.9 trillion or 76.4% of
   GDP.^[3]

State and local governments[edit]

   In 1946, US state and local governments owed $12.7 billion of debt or
   5.71% of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $2.4 trillion or 16.5%
   of GDP.^[3]

   State and local governments have significant financial assets, totaling
   $2.7 trillion in 2009. In 2009, these included $1.3 trillion in credit
   market debt (that is, debt owed by other sectors to state and local
   governments). These figures do not include state and local retirement
   funds.^[18] State and local retirement funds held $2.7 trillion in
   assets at the end of 2009.^[19]

Federal government[edit]

   Main article: United States public debt

   In 1946, the federal government owed $251 billion of debt or 102.7% of
   GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $7.8 trillion, but the federal
   government's debt-to-GDP ratio had fallen to 54.75%.^[3]

   The federal government held $1.4 trillion in assets at the end of 2009.
   This is more than double the assets held by the federal government in
   2007 ($686 billion), mainly due to the acquisition of corporate
   equities, credit market debt, and cash. The federal government held
   $223 billion in corporate equity at the beginning of 2009; this had
   fallen to $67.4 billion at the end of that year.^[18]

   These figures do not include federal government retirement funds.
   Federal government retirement funds held $1.3 trillion in assets at the
   end of 2009.^[20]

   These figures also do not include debt that the federal government owes
   to federal funds and agencies such as the Social Security Trust Fund.
   It also does not include "unfunded liabilities" to entitlement programs
   such as Social Security and Medicare either as debt or accounting
   liabilities.^[20]

Negative real interest rates[edit]

   Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest
   rates on government debt.^[21] Such low rates, outpaced by the
   inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no
   alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional
   investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money
   market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest
   sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against
   risk.^[22]^[23] Lawrence Summers, Matthew Yglesias and other economists
   state that at such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer
   money, and improves creditworthiness.^[24]^[25] In the late 1940s
   through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden
   by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative
   real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt
   rates will continue to stay so low.^[22]^[26] In January, 2012, the
   U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry
   and Financial Markets Association unanimously recommended that
   government debt be allowed to auction even lower, at negative absolute
   interest rates.^[27]

   Figures of total debt typically do not include other financial
   obligations such as derivatives. Partly this is due to the complexities
   of quantifying derivatives - the United States Comptroller of the
   Currency reports derivative contracts in terms of notional value,^[28]
   net current credit exposure,^[29] and fair value,^[30] among others.

   The number commonly used by the media is notional value, which is a
   base value used to determine the size of the cash flows exchanged in
   the contract.^[31] Fair value (or market value) is the value of the
   contract either on the open market or as it is appraised by
   accountants. Fair value can be positive or negative depending on the
   side of the contract the party is on.^[30] Credit exposure is defined
   as the net loss which holders of derivatives would suffer if their
   counterparties in those derivatives contracts defaulted.^[29]

   The notional value of derivative contracts held by US financial
   institutions is $216.5 trillion, or more than 15 times US GDP.^[28]

   The fair value of US-held derivatives contracts in the first quarter of
   2010 was $4,002 billion (28.1% of GDP) for positions with positive
   values (known as "derivatives receivables"), and $3,886 for positions
   with negative values (27.3% of GDP).^[30] Interest rate derivatives
   form by far the largest part of US derivative contracts by all
   measures, accounting for $3,147 billion or 79% of derivatives
   receivables.^[29]

   The measure preferred by the Office of the Comptroller is net current
   credit exposure (NCCE), which measures the risk to banks and the
   financial system in derivatives contracts. The net current credit
   exposure (NCCE) of American financial institutions to derivatives in
   the first quarter of 2010 to $359 billion or 2.5% of GDP, down from
   $800 billion at the end of 2008 in the wake of the global financial
   crisis, when it stood at 5.5% of GDP. The difference between the market
   value of US derivatives and the credit exposure to the financial system
   is due to netting - financial institutions tend to have many positions
   with their counterparties that have positive and negative values,
   resulting in a much smaller exposure than the sum of the market values
   of their derivative positions.^[29] Netting reduces the credit exposure
   of the US financial system to derivatives by more than 90%, as compared
   to 50.6% at the beginning of 1998.^[32]

   Derivatives contracts are overwhelmingly held by large financial
   institutions. The five largest US banks hold 97% of derivatives by
   notional value; the top 25 hold nearly 100%.^[32] Banks currently hold
   collateral against their derivative exposures amounting to 67% of their
   net current credit exposure.^[33]

Foreign debt, assets, and liabilities[edit]

   Foreigners own more than $15.6 trillion of US financial assets, or 107%
   of GDP. Americans own $11.5 trillion of foreign assets, approximately
   78.9% of US GDP.^[34]

   Foreign holdings of US assets are concentrated in debt. Americans own
   more foreign equity and foreign direct investment than foreigners own
   in the United States, but foreigners hold nearly four times as much US
   debt as Americans hold in foreign debt.

   15.2% of all US debt is owed to foreigners.^[12] Of the $7.9 trillion
   Americans owe to foreigners, $3.9 trillion is owed by the federal
   government. 48% of US treasury securities are held by foreigners.^[35]
   Foreigners hold $1.28 trillion in agency- and government sponsored
   enterprise-backed securities, and another $2.33 trillion in US
   corporate bonds.^[34]

   Foreigners hold 24% of domestic corporate debt^[36] and 17% of domestic
   corporate equity.^[37]

Sectoral financial balances[edit]

   Main article: Sectoral financial balances
   Sectoral financial balances in U.S. economy 1990-2012. By definition,
   the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the U.S. capital
   surplus and private sector surplus have driven a government budget
   deficit.

   Economist Martin Wolf explained in July 2012 that government fiscal
   balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the U.S.
   economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private
   financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these
   three sectors must be zero by definition. In the U.S., a foreign
   financial surplus (or capital surplus) exists because capital is
   imported (net) to fund the trade deficit. Further, there is a private
   sector financial surplus due to household savings exceeding business
   investment. By definition, there must therefore exist a government
   budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes
   federal, state and local. For example, the government budget deficit in
   2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal),
   offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of
   6% GDP.^[38]

   Wolf argued that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to
   surplus forced the government balance into deficit, writing: "The
   financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the
   almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic
   product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of
   2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal
   and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the
   collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because
   there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the
   massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus
   or, in other words, from boom to bust."^[38]

   Economist Paul Krugman also explained in December 2011 the causes of
   the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: "This huge move into
   surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in
   household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of
   customers."^[39]
