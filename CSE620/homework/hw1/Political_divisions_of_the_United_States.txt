   Political divisions of the United States are the various governing
   entities that together form the United States. The primary division is
   the state. The United States Federal and State governments operate
   within a system of parallel sovereignty, so states are not technically
   "divisions" created from the United States, but rather units that,
   together with the federal district and other territories administered
   by the Federal government, compose the United States.

   States are typically subdivided into counties. Louisiana uses the term
   parish and Alaska uses the term borough for what the Census terms
   county-equivalents in those states.

   Territories, except the Minor Outlying Islands are subdivided into
   municipalities. Guam uses the term Village and the U.S. Virgin Islands
   uses the term Districts, American Samoa uses the terms district and
   Unorganized atolls.

   Counties and county equivalents may be further subdivided into
   townships. Towns in New York and New England are treated equivalent to
   townships by the United States Census Bureau. Towns or townships are
   used as subdivisions of a county in 20 states, mostly in the Northeast
   and Midwest.^[1]

   Population centers may be organized into incorporated cities, towns,
   villages, and other types of municipalities. Municipalities are
   typically subordinate to a county government, with some exceptions.
   Certain cities, for example, have consolidated with their county
   government as consolidated city-counties. In Virginia, cities are
   completely independent from the county in which they would otherwise be
   a part. In some states, particularly in New England, towns form the
   primary unit of local government below the state level, in some cases
   eliminating the need for county government entirely.

   Outside of the states, other divisions include the federal district,
   insular areas administered by the Federal government, and American
   Indian reservations. The Federal government also maintains exclusive
   jurisdiction over military installations and American embassies and
   consulates located in foreign countries. Other special purpose
   divisions exist separate from those for general governance, examples of
   which include conservation districts and Congressional districts.

States and their subdivisions[edit]

States[edit]

   Main articles: U.S. state, List of U.S. states and Local government in
   the United States

   The primary political unit of the United States is the State. According
   to numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the 50
   individual states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign
   jurisdictions. The 13 original states Thirteen Colonies declared
   independence from the British Empire in 1776. In 1777, they established
   a government under the Articles of Confederation. The United States
   Constitution replaced the Articles in 1789. The Constitution
   establishes the authority of the Federal government of the United
   States, which includes the power to coin money and conduct foreign
   policy. The Constitution also maintains the sovereignty of each state.
   The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution reinforces this idea of
   parallel sovereignty, declaring that the powers not delegated to the
   federal government are retained by the states.

   The 37 additional states were admitted to the Union by acts of the
   United States Congress, beginning with Vermont in 1791 and ending with
   Hawaii in 1959.

   The United States Supreme Court in Texas v. White held that states do
   not have the right to secede, though it did allow some possibility of
   the divisibility "through revolution, or through consent of the
   States."^[2]^[3]

   Four states (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky) call
   themselves "commonwealths." The word commonwealth in this context
   refers to the common "wealth", or welfare, of the public.^[4] The term
   has no legal impact.^[5]

   The 50 states of the United States of America are as follows (this list
   includes both the postal code abbreviation and the traditional
   abbreviation for each state):

   Map of United States with state border lines. Note that Alaska and
   Hawaii are shown at different scales and that the Aleutian Islands and
   the uninhabited northwestern Hawaiian Islands are omitted from this
   map.

   The 50 states can be divided into regions in many different ways.
     * The continental United States typically refers to the main block of
       48 states with the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Pacific Ocean to the
       west, Canada to the north, and Mexico to the south. Since this
       grouping contains 48 states, it is also commonly referred to as
       "the Lower 48". The designation "conterminous" or "contiguous"
       United States is also used for this grouping of 48 states, arguably
       more accurately, since Alaska is also located on the North American
       continent, and therefore "continental United States" should really
       refer to the Lower 48, plus Alaska.
     * Alaska is an exclave of the United States, physically connected
       only to Canada
     * Hawaii is located on an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean

Counties[edit]

   Main article: County (United States)
   See also: County-equivalent

   The states are divided into smaller administrative regions, called
   counties in all but two states. The exceptions are Alaska where main
   subdivisions is the boroughs (parts of the state are not included in
   any borough, called the Unorganized Borough, is divided into "census
   areas"), and Louisiana (which is divided into county-equivalents that
   are called parishes). Counties exist to provide general local support
   of state government activities, such as collection of property tax
   revenues (counties almost never have their own power to tax), but
   without providing most of the services one associates with
   municipalities. Counties have varying degrees of political and legal
   significance. In some states, mainly in New England, they are mainly
   used as judicial districts. In other states, counties have broad powers
   in housing, education, transportation and recreation.

   Counties may contain a number of cities, towns, villages, or hamlets,
   or sometimes just a part of a city. Some cities are consolidated with,
   and coterminous with, their counties, including Philadelphia, Honolulu,
   San Francisco, and Denver—that is to say, these counties consist in
   their entirety of a single municipality the government of which also
   operates as the county government. Some counties, such as Arlington
   County, Virginia, do not have any additional subdivisions. Some states
   contain independent cities that are not part of any county. New York
   City is coterminous with five counties.

Towns and Townships[edit]

   Main article: Township (United States)
   See also: Incorporated town § United States

   Towns and townships are subdivisions of counties. The terms townships
   and towns are closely related (in many historical documents the terms
   are used interchangeably). However, the powers granted to towns or
   townships varies considerably from state to state. In New England,
   towns are a principal form of local government, providing many of the
   functions of counties in other states. In California, by contrast, the
   pertinent statutes of the Government Code clarify that "town" is simply
   another word for "city", especially a general law city as distinct from
   a charter city.

   Some townships have governments and political power, others are simply
   geographic designations. Townships in the United States are generally
   the product of the Public Land Survey System. For more information, see
   survey township and civil township.

Municipalities[edit]

   Main article: City § United States

   There are approximately 30,000 incorporated cities in the United
   States, with varying degrees of self-rule.

Other subdivisions[edit]

   In some states, such as Michigan, state universities are
   constitutionally autonomous jurisdictions, possessed of a special
   status somewhat equivalent to that of metropolitan municipality. That
   is, as bodies corporate, they operate as though they were
   municipalities but their autonomy from most legislative and executive
   control makes them equally comparable to administrative divisions of
   the state, equal or superior to counties.^[citation needed]

Federal oversight of United States territory[edit]

Congress of the United States[edit]

   Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution defines the extent of
   the authority that the U.S. Congress exercises over the territory of
   the United States:

          New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but
          no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction
          of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of
          two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of
          the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the
          Congress.

          The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful
          Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property
          belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution
          shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United
          States, or of any particular State.

   The power of Congress over territorial divisions that are not part of
   one of the states is exclusive and universal. Once a territory becomes
   a state of the Union, the state must consent to any changes pertaining
   to the jurisdiction of that state. The only potential violation of this
   occurred when the legislature of Virginia declared the secession of
   Virginia from the United States at the start of the American Civil War
   and a newly formed alternative Virginia legislature, recognized by the
   federal government, consented to have West Virginia secede from
   Virginia.

United States Department of the Interior[edit]

   On March 3, 1849, the last day of the 30th Congress, a bill was passed
   to create the U.S. Department of the Interior to take charge of the
   internal affairs of United States territory. The Interior Department
   has a wide range of responsibilities (which include the regulation of
   territorial governments, the basic responsibilities for public lands,
   and other various duties).

   In contrast to similarly named Departments in other countries, the
   United States Department of the Interior is not responsible for local
   government or for civil administration except in the cases of Indian
   reservations, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and island
   dependencies, through the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA).

Other Federal Oversight[edit]

   The federal government also exercises exclusive jurisdiction over
   overseas military installations and American embassies and consulates
   located in foreign countries. It exercises concurrent jurisdiction to
   varying degrees with the states in many domestic federal enclaves.

Jurisdictions not administered by the states[edit]

District of Columbia[edit]

   Main article: District of Columbia

   A separate federal district, the District of Columbia, which is under
   the direct authority of Congress, was formed from land ceded to the
   Federal Government by the states of Maryland and Virginia; however, the
   territory ceded by Virginia was returned to that state in 1846. The
   District does not form part of any state and the United States Congress
   exercises "exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever", over the
   city; however, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act provides for
   limited home rule, including an elected mayor and city council.
   Residents of the District can vote in presidential elections, as the
   twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution grants the
   District three electors in the Electoral College.

Insular Areas[edit]

   Main articles: Insular Area and Territories of the United States

   The insular areas of the United States are those jurisdictions that are
   neither a part of one of the 50 states nor the federal district.^[6]
   Unlike within the States, sovereignty over insular areas rests not with
   the local people, but in Congress. In most cases, however, Congress has
   granted considerable self-rule through an Organic Act, which functions
   as a local constitution. Insular areas are administered by the Federal
   Government through the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular
   Affairs.

   The insular areas include a number of territories under the sovereignty
   of the United States and three sovereign nations in free association
   with the United States. Territories incorporated within the provisions
   of the U.S. Constitution are designated incorporated territories.
   Territories not so incorporated are designated "unincorporated".
   Territories may also be organized, if granted by an Organic Act of
   Congress or unorganized (without direct authorization of
   self-government by such an act).

   The Northwest Ordinance grants territories the right to send a
   non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress. Since the organization of the
   Northwest Territory in 1789, all areas not admitted to the United
   States as States were under the direct control of Congress as organized
   incorporated territories, with some political autonomy at the local
   level. These organized incorporated territories subsequently became
   states. Thirty-one of the current 50 states were organized incorporated
   territories before their admission to the Union. Since the admission of
   Hawaii to the Union in 1959, there has been a single incorporated
   territory, the uninhabited Palmyra Atoll (formerly part of the Hawaii
   Territory, but excluded from the act of admission).

   The unincorporated territories of the United States and their ISO
   3166-1 codes (in parentheses) are as follows:

          +  American Samoa (AS) (unorganized; self-governing under
            authority of the U.S. Department of the Interior)
          +  Guam (GU) (organized under Organic Act of 1950)
          +  Northern Mariana Islands (MP) (commonwealth, organized under
            1977 Covenant)
          +  Puerto Rico (PR) (commonwealth since 1952, organized under
            Law 600 of 1950)
          +  United States Virgin Islands (VI) (organized under Revised
            Organic Act of 1954)

   Along with Palmyra Atoll, the following uninhabited territories form
   the United States Minor Outlying Islands (UM):

          + Baker Island
          + Howland Island
          + Jarvis Island
          + Johnston Atoll
          + Kingman Reef
          + Midway Atoll (administered as the Midway Atoll National
            Wildlife Refuge; small number of contractors present)
          + Navassa Island (disputed with Haiti)
          + Wake Island (small number of contractors present; disputed
            with Marshall Islands)

   In addition to the territories noted above, the United States
   administered the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from July 18,
   1947 until October 1, 1994. The trust territory was subsequently
   divided into four political entities—the Northern Mariana Islands,
   listed above, and three freely-associated states with which the United
   States has entered into the Compact of Free Association (ISO 3166-1
   codes in parentheses):

          +  Marshall Islands (MH)
          +  Federated States of Micronesia (FM)
          +  Palau (PW)

   Cuba and the Philippines are two additional former unincorporated
   territories that are now independent countries. The United States Navy
   has held the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in a portion of Guantánamo Bay,
   Cuba, since 1898. The United States government possesses a lease to
   this land, which only mutual agreement or United States abandonment of
   the area can terminate. The present Cuban government of Raúl Castro
   disputes this arrangement, claiming Cuba was not truly sovereign at the
   time of the signing. The United States argues this point is irrelevant
   because Cuba apparently ratified the lease post-revolution, and with
   full sovereignty, when it cashed one rent check in accordance with the
   disputed treaty.

   The United States government is part of several international disputes
   over the disposition of certain maritime and insular sovereignties,
   some of which would be considered territories. Bajo Nuevo Bank and
   Serranilla Bank are two such disputed claims. See International
   territorial disputes of the United States for more information.

   The United States also holds several other territories, districts, and
   possessions, notably the federal district of the District of Columbia,
   and several overseas insular areas, the most significant of which are
   American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and
   the United States Virgin Islands. Islands gained by the United States
   in the war against Spain at the turn of the 20th century under the
   control of the federal government is considered part of the "United
   States" for purposes of law.;^[7] on the other hand, the United States
   Supreme Court declared in a series of opinions known as the Insular
   Cases that the Constitution extended ex proprio vigore to the
   territories. However, the Court in these cases also established the
   doctrine of territorial incorporation. Under the same, the Constitution
   only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Alaska and
   Hawaii, whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated
   territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.^[8]^[9]

   The Northern Marianas Islands is a territory which are commonwealths
   associated with the United States. They might some day advance to
   statehood, or they might become independent—as did the Philippines in
   1946, after it was a commonwealth of the United States for many years.
   A territory—whether "organized" or "unorganized"—has significantly
   fewer rights in the grand scheme of things than a commonwealth (let
   alone a state), but it ranks at least a notch above "possessions" such
   as Wake Island, which has no permanent population and thus does not
   require even a simple territorial government.

American Indian Reservations[edit]

   Main article: Indian reservation

   American Indian reservations are areas of land managed by a American
   Indian tribe under the United States Department of the Interior's
   Bureau of Indian Affairs. There are about 310 Indian reservations in
   the United States. Tribes possess limited tribal sovereignty over the
   land in their reservation. As a result laws on tribal lands may vary
   from the surrounding area.^[10] The tribal council, not the county or
   state government, generally has jurisdiction over reservations.
   Different reservations have different systems of government, which may
   or may not replicate the forms of government found outside the
   reservation. Most Indian reservations were established by the federal
   government; a limited number, mainly in the East, owe their origin to
   state recognition.^[11]

   Residents of a reservation may vote as residents of a state and are
   required to pay federal taxes. The special status of reservations has
   created both opportunities (such as gambling in states that normally
   disallow it) and challenges (such as the unwillingness of some
   companies to do business in an area where they are not certain what
   laws will apply to them).

Other defined areas[edit]

   In addition to general-purpose government entities legislating at the
   state, county, and city level, special-purpose areas may exist as well.
   Conservation districts are one such type of special purpose area,
   created for the purpose of conserving land, natural scenery, flora, and
   fauna.

   Congressional districts are another example, formed for the purpose of
   electing members to the United States Congress.

   Additionally, U.S. courts have ruled that there are smaller areas which
   are to be considered as fulfilling government functions, and should
   therefore be bound by the same restrictions placed on "traditional"
   (US-aligned) government bodies. These include homeowners associations
   (determined in Shelley v. Kraemer, Loren v. Sasser, Committee for a
   Better Twin Rivers v. Twin Rivers Homeowners’ Association), and
   company-owned towns (both for employees and for consumers, decided in
   the USSC case Marsh v. Alabama in 1946). Many homeowners' and
   neighborhood associations are considered non-profit organizations, but
   have the ability to raise taxes or fees, fine members for infractions
   against association-rules, and initiate lawsuits. The question of civil
   rights in such communities has not yet been conclusively determined,
   and varies from state to state.
