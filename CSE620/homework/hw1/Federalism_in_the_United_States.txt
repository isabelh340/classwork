Federalism in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The United States is composed of fifty self-governing states and
   several territories.

   Federalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between
   U.S. state governments and the federal government of the United States.
   Since the founding of the country, and particularly with the end of the
   American Civil War, power shifted away from the states and towards the
   national government. The progression of federalism includes Dual
   federalism, state centered federalism and new federalism.

Federalism in the 1700's[edit]

   Federalism was a political system arising out of discontent with the
   Articles of Confederation which gave little practical authority to the
   federal government. For example, the Articles allowed the Continental
   Congress the power to sign treaties or declare war, but it was
   essentially powerless to do so because all major decisions required a
   unanimous vote.^[1]

   The movement was greatly strengthened by the reaction to Shays'
   Rebellion of 1786–1787, which was an armed uprising of yeoman farmers
   in western Massachusetts. The rebellion was fueled by a poor economy
   that was created, in part, by the inability of the federal government
   to deal effectively with the debt from the American Revolution.
   Moreover, the federal government had proven incapable of raising an
   army to quell the rebellion, so that Massachusetts had been forced to
   raise its own.

   In 1787, fifty-five delegates met at a Constitutional convention in
   Philadelphia and generated ideas of a bicameral legislature (United
   States Congress), balanced representation of small and large states
   (Great Compromise), and checks and balances. James Madison stated in a
   long pre-convention memorandum to delegates that because "one could
   hardly expect the state legislatures to take enlightened views on
   national affairs", stronger central government was necessary.^[2] This
   convention almost immediately dropped its original mandate and instead
   set about constructing a new Constitution of the United States. Once
   the convention concluded and released the Constitution for public
   consumption, the Federalist movement became focused on getting the
   Constitution ratified.

   The most forceful defense of the new Constitution was The Federalist
   Papers, a compilation of 85 anonymous essays published in New York City
   to convince the people of the state to vote for ratification. These
   articles, written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, with some
   contributed by John Jay, examined the benefits of the new, proposed
   Constitution, and analyzed the political theory and function behind the
   various articles of the Constitution. The Federalist Papers remains one
   of the most important documents in American political science.

   Those opposed to the new Constitution became known as the
   "Anti-Federalists". They generally were local rather than cosmopolitan
   in perspective, oriented to plantations and farms rather than commerce
   or finance, and wanted strong state governments and a weak national
   government. The Anti-Federalist critique soon centered on the absence
   of a Bill of Rights, which Federalists promised to provide.

   Because George Washington lent his prestige to the Constitution and
   because of the ingenuity and organizational skills of its proponents,
   the Constitution was ratified by all the states. The outgoing Congress
   under the Articles of Confederation scheduled elections for the new
   government, and set March 4, 1789 as the date that the new government
   would take power. In 1789, Congress submitted twelve articles of
   amendment to the states. Ten of these articles, written by Madison,
   achieved passage on December 15, 1791 and became the Bill of Rights.
   The Tenth Amendment set the guidelines for federalism in the United
   States.

Federalist Party[edit]

   Main article: Federalist Party (United States)

   As soon as the first Federalist movement dissipated, a second one
   sprang up to take its place. This one was based on the policies of
   Alexander Hamilton and his allies for a stronger national government, a
   loose construction of the Constitution, and a mercantile (rather than
   agricultural) economy. As time progressed, the factions which adhered
   to these policies organized themselves into the nation's first
   political party, the Federalist Party, and the movement's focus and
   fortunes began to track those of the party it spawned.

   While the Federalist movement of the 1780s and the Federalist Party
   were distinct entities, they were related in more than just a common
   name. The Democratic-Republican Party, the opposition to the Federalist
   Party, emphasized the fear that a strong national government was a
   threat to the liberties of the people. They stressed that the national
   debt created by the new government would bankrupt the country, and that
   federal bondholders were paid from taxes paid by honest farmers and
   workingmen. These themes resonated with the Anti-Federalists, the
   opposition to the Federalist movement of the 1780s. As Norman Risjord
   has documented for Virginia, of the supporters of the Constitution in
   1788, 69% joined the Federalist party, while nearly all (94%) of the
   opponents joined the Republicans. 71% of Thomas Jefferson's supporters
   in Virginia were former anti-federalists who continued to fear
   centralized government, while only 29% had been proponents of the
   Constitution a few years before. In short, nearly all of the opponents
   of the Federalist movement became opponents of the Federalist Party.

   The movement reached its zenith with the election of an overtly
   Federalist President, John Adams. However, with the defeat of Adams in
   the election of 1800 and the death of Hamilton, the Federalist Party
   began a long decline from which it never recovered. What finally
   finished off the Federalist party was the Hartford Convention of 1814,
   in which five New England states gathered to discuss several
   constitutional amendments necessary to protect New England's interests
   in regards to the blockade of their ports by the British during the War
   of 1812. The threat of secession was also proposed during these secret
   meetings. Three delegates were sent to Washington, DC to negotiate New
   England's terms only to discover the signing of the Treaty of Ghent,
   ending the war with the British. The Federalists were then seen by many
   as traitors to the union.^[3]

Federalism under the Marshall Court[edit]

   See also: John Marshall

   The United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall
   played an important role in defining the power of the federal and state
   governments during the early 19th century. As the U.S. Constitution
   does not specifically define many dividing lines between the layers of
   government, the Supreme Court settled the issue in New York. The
   question was answered particularly in the cases, McCulloch v. Maryland
   and Gibbons v. Ogden, which broadly expanded the power of the national
   government.

Dual Federalism[edit]

   Main article: Dual federalism

   Despite Chief Justice Marshall's strong push for the federal
   government, the court of his successor, Roger B. Taney (1835–1863),
   decided cases that favored equally strong national and state
   governments. The basic philosophy during this time was that the U.S.
   Government ought to be limited to its enumerated powers and that all
   others belonged to the states. Both the sixteenth and the seventeenth
   amendment bolstered the power of the national government, and divided
   state and federal power.

Between Dual Federalism and the New Deal[edit]

   Following the Taney court and the rise of Dual federalism, the division
   of labor between federal, state, and local governments was relatively
   unchanged for over a century. Political scientist Theodore J. Lowi
   summarized the system in place during those years in The End of the
   Republican Era^[4]

   Nevertheless, the modern federal apparatus owes its origins to changes
   that occurred during the period between 1861 and 1933. While banks had
   long been incorporated and regulated by the states, the National Bank
   Acts of 1863 and 1864 saw Congress establish a network of national
   banks that had their reserve requirements set by officials in
   Washington. During World War I, a system of federal banks devoted to
   aiding farmers was established, and a network of federal banks designed
   to promote home ownership came into existence in the last year of
   Herbert Hoover's administration. Congress used its power over
   interstate commerce to regulate the rates of interstate (and eventually
   intrastate) railroads and even regulated their stock issues and labor
   relations, going so far as to enact a law regulating pay rates for
   railroad workers on the eve of World War I. During the 1920s, Congress
   enacted laws bestowing collective bargaining rights on employees of
   interstate railroads and some observers dared to predict it would
   eventually bestow collective bargaining rights on persons working in
   all industries. Congress also used the commerce power to enact morals
   legislation, such as the Mann Act of 1907 barring the transfer of women
   across state lines for immoral purposes, even as the commerce power
   remained limited to interstate transportation—it did not extend to what
   were viewed as intrastate activities such as manufacturing and mining.

   As early as 1913, there was talk of regulating stock exchanges, and the
   Capital Issues Committee formed to control access to credit during
   World War I recommended federal regulation of all stock issues and
   exchanges shortly before it ceased operating in 1921. With the Morrill
   Land-Grant Acts Congress used land sale revenues to make grants to the
   states for colleges during the Civil War on the theory that land sale
   revenues could be devoted to subjects beyond those listed in Article I,
   Section 8 of the Constitution. On several occasions during the 1880s,
   one house of Congress or the other passed bills providing land sale
   revenues to the states for the purpose of aiding primary schools.
   During the first years of twentieth century, the endeavors funded with
   federal grants multiplied, and Congress began using general revenues to
   fund them—thus utilizing the general welfare clause's broad spending
   power, even though it had been discredited for almost a century
   (Hamilton's view that a broad spending power could be derived from the
   clause had been all but abandoned by 1840).

   During Herbert Hoover's administration, grants went to the states for
   the purpose of funding poor relief. The Supreme Court began applying
   the Bill of Rights to the states during the 1920s even though the
   Fourteenth Amendment had not been represented as subjecting the states
   to its provisions during the debates that preceded ratification of it.
   The 1920s also saw Washington expand its role in domestic law
   enforcement. Disaster relief for areas affected by floods or crop
   failures dated from 1874, and these appropriations began to multiply
   during the administration of Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921). By 1933, the
   precedents necessary for the federal government to exercise broad
   regulatory power over all economic activity and spend for any purpose
   it saw fit were almost all in place. Virtually all that remained was
   for the will to be mustered in Congress and for the Supreme Court to
   acquiesce.^[5]

   Lowi notes^[6] that this division of labor was changed dramatically
   with the advent of the New Deal, and three Supreme Court cases that
   validated the shift in power:
     * National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel
       Corporation,
     * Helvering v. Davis, and
     * Steward Machine Company v. Davis.

Cooperative federalism[edit]

   Main article: Cooperative federalism

   The Great Depression marked an abrupt end to Dual Federalism and a
   dramatic shift to a strong national government. President Franklin D.
   Roosevelt's New Deal policies reached into the lives of U.S. citizens
   like no other federal measure had. As the Supreme Court had rejected
   nearly all of Roosevelt's economic proposals, in 1936 the president
   proposed appointing a new Supreme Court justice for each sitting one
   aged 70 or older. The expansion of the Court along with a
   Democrat-controlled Congress would tilt Court rulings in favor of
   Roosevelt's policies.^[7] Lowi notes three Supreme Court cases that
   validated the shift in power:^[8]
     * National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel
       Corporation,
     * Helvering v. Davis, and
     * Steward Machine Company v. Davis.

   The national government was forced to cooperate with all levels of
   government to implement the New Deal policies; local government earned
   an equal standing with the other layers, as the federal government
   relied on political machines at a city level to bypass state
   legislatures. The formerly distinct division of responsibilities
   between state and national government had been described as a "layer
   cake," but, with the lines of duty blurred, cooperative federalism was
   likened to a "marble cake" or a "picket fence." In cooperative
   federalism, federal funds are distributed through grants in aid or
   categorical grants which gave the federal government more control over
   the use of the money.

New Federalism[edit]

   Main article: New Federalism

   Another movement calling itself "New Federalism" appeared in the late
   20th century and early 21st century. New Federalism, which is
   characterized by a gradual return of power to the states, was initiated
   by President Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) with his "devolution revolution"
   in the early 1980s and lasted until 2001. Previously, the federal
   government had granted money to the states categorically, limiting the
   states to use this funding for specific programs. Reagan's
   administration, however, introduced a practice of giving block grants,
   freeing state governments to spend the money at their own discretion.

   New Federalism is sometimes called "states' rights", although its
   proponents usually eschew the latter term because of its associations
   with Jim Crow and segregation. Unlike the states' rights movement of
   the mid-20th century which centered around the civil rights movement,
   the modern federalist movement is concerned far more with expansive
   interpretations of the Commerce Clause, as in the areas of medical
   marijuana (Gonzales v. Raich), partial birth abortion (Gonzales v.
   Carhart), gun possession (United States v. Lopez), federal police
   powers (United States v. Morrison, which struck down portions of the
   Violence Against Women Act), or agriculture (Wickard v. Filburn).
