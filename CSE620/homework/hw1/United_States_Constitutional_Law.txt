Interpreting the Constitution and the authority of the Supreme Court[edit]

Introduction[edit]

   United States constitutional law defines the scope and application of
   the terms of the Constitution. It covers areas of law such as the
   relationship between the federal government and state governments, the
   rights of individuals, and other fundamental aspects of the application
   of government authority in the United States. It is a field of law that
   is broad and complex. Some constitutional scholars maintain that the
   authors of the Constitution intended that it be vague and subject to
   interpretation so that it could be adapted to the needs of a changing
   society. Others maintain that the provisions of the Constitution should
   be strictly construed and their provisions applied in a very literal
   manner.^[2]

The power of judicial review[edit]

   Early in its history, in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803) and
   Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. 87 (1810), the Supreme Court of the United
   States declared that the judicial power granted to it by Article III of
   the United States Constitution included the power of judicial review,
   to consider challenges to the constitutionality of a State or Federal
   law. According to this jurisprudence, when the Court measures a law
   against the Constitution and finds the law wanting, the Court is
   empowered and indeed obligated to strike down that law. In this role,
   for example, the Court has struck down state laws for failing to
   conform to the Contract Clause (see, e.g., Dartmouth College v.
   Woodward) or the Equal Protection Clause (see, e.g., Brown v. Board of
   Education), and it has invalidated federal laws for failing to arise
   under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution (see, e.g., United States
   v. Lopez).

Scope and effect[edit]

   The Supreme Court's interpretations of constitutional law are binding
   on the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, on
   the lower courts in the federal system, and on all state courts. This
   system of binding interpretations or precedents evolved from the common
   law system (called "stare decisis"), where courts are bound by their
   own prior decisions and by the decisions of higher courts. While
   neither English common law courts nor continental civil law courts
   generally had the power to declare legislation unconstitutional (only
   the power to change law), the United States Supreme Court has long been
   understood to have the power to declare federal or state legislation
   unconstitutional.

Prudential limits—the principles of justiciability[edit]

   Before deciding a constitutional question, the Supreme Court may
   consider whether the court can avoid the constitutional question by
   basing its decision on a non-constitutional issue at dispute. For
   example, if a federal statute is on shaky constitutional footing but
   has been applied to the challenging party in a manner that does not
   implicate the basis for the constitutional claim, the Supreme Court
   will not decide whether the statute might be unconstitutional if it
   were applied differently. Or, when reviewing a decision of a state's
   highest court, the Court may avoid the constitutional question if the
   state court's decision is based on an independent and adequate
   state-law grounds.

   Federal courts consider other doctrines before allowing a lawsuit to go
   forward:
     * Actual dispute - the lawsuit concerns a "case or controversy" under
       the meaning of Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution
     * Standing - the party bringing the suit must have (1) a
       particularized and concrete injury, (2) a causal connection between
       the complained-of conduct and that injury, and (3) a likelihood
       that a favorable court decision will redress the injury
     * Ripeness - a party will lack standing where her case raises
       abstract, hypothetical or conjectural questions.
     * Mootness - a party is seeking redress over a case that no longer
       has a basis for dispute, though there are limited exceptions
     * Political question - the issues raised in the suit are unreviewable
       because the Constitution relegates it to another branch of
       government.

   Consistent with these doctrines, the Court considers itself prohibited
   from issuing advisory opinions where there is no actual case or
   controversy before them.(See Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346
   (1911)). These doctrines, because they apply to all federal cases
   whether of constitutional dimension or not, are discussed separately in
   the article on federal jurisdiction.

Differing views on the role of the Court[edit]

   There are a number of ways that commentators and Justices of the
   Supreme Court have defined the Court's role, and its jurisprudential
   method:
     * Current Associate Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are
       originalists^[citation needed]; originalism is a family of similar
       theories that hold that the Constitution has a fixed meaning from
       an authority contemporaneous with the ratification (although
       opinion as to what that authority is varies; see discussion at
       originalism), and that it should be construed in light of that
       authority. Unless there is a historic and/or extremely pressing
       reason to interpret the Constitution differently, originalists vote
       as they think the Constitution as it was written in the late 18th
       Century would dictate.
     * Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter was a leading proponent of
       so-called judicial restraint,^[citation needed] in that he believed
       that the Supreme Court should not make law (which, by invalidating
       or significantly altering the meaning of Congressional bills,
       Frankfurter felt they were), and so believers in this idea often
       vote not to grant cases the writ of certiorari. Associate Justice
       Stephen Breyer generally advocates a quasi-purposivist
       approach,^[citation needed] focusing on what the law was supposed
       to achieve rather than what it actually says, and measuring the
       possible outcomes of voting one way or another.
     * Other Justices have taken a more instrumentalist approach (see
       judicial activism), believing it is the role of the Supreme Court
       to reflect societal changes. They often see the Constitution as a
       living, changing and adaptable document; thus their ruling will be
       in stark contrast to originalists. Compare, for example, the
       differing opinions of Justices Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who
       is a more instrumentalist justice.^[citation needed]
     * Finally, there are some Justices who do not have a clear judicial
       philosophy, and so decide cases purely on each one's individual
       merits.

   Debate continues over which, if any, of these interpretive strategies
   is "better". Complicating the analysis is the lack of direct
   correspondence between the various interpretive strategies and
   contemporary notions of "conservatism" or "liberalism". For example,
   originalism is often associated with conservatism, but Justice Scalia's
   opinions in 2004 about the detention of persons at Guantanamo Bay were
   probably the most libertarian, because he did not believe that the
   framers of the Constitution had granted Executive powers for the
   purpose of preventing judicial and legislative notice.

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States Constitution

The Founding[edit]

   Benjamin Franklin and other prominent political actors of the day had a
   great hand in shaping the constitutionalism so many of us enjoy today.
   Their philosophy roughly equates to the forming of an institutional
   framework which would allow for the development of the opportunities
   presented by the New World, with the important ethical caveat that no
   man ought gain at the expense of another. (Franklin has written
   numerous pieces on this subject as may be seen in any decent collection
   of his works. His views do differ somewhat, however, from other
   theorists such as Madison, for example. Consider the political premises
   urged in Federalist 10, for instance, and contrast with the
   presentation of the ideal citizen type in Franklin's Autobiography. But
   these differences are, in the final analysis, inconsiderable.)

   Among other, lesser known, signers of the Declaration of Independence,
   is James Wilson, founder of the University of Pennsylvania law school
   and Supreme Court Justice. In his inaugural law lectures, Wilson offers
   to his contemporaries an interesting exposition of the constitutional
   principles brought to life by the sacrifices of many great Americans.
   In citing ancient models of virtue (Roman matrons, First Lecture, first
   chapter) Wilson, perhaps unintentionally, approximates himself
   theoretically to his fellow Pennsylvanian, Franklin, and makes clear
   that as far as the Founders were concerned, there was no substantial
   difference between virtues, ancient and modern.

   The lectures that follow present a rigorous treatment of the
   differences and important similarities between the English and the
   American constitutions. This question was important to eighteenth
   century citizens. But it may be that further study of this view will
   allow us to understand better the intent of the Framers. Furthermore,
   it would seem, it may prove to be of interest to young American legal
   scholars, many of whom are now required to take courses in comparative
   law.

   What contemporary students do seem to have in common, however, with the
   theorists of the American Founding, is articulated by Wilson in the
   course of a discussion of some general principles of law and obligation
   (Second chapter). He writes: "Order, proportion, and fitness pervade
   the universe. Around us, we see; within us, feel; above us, we admire a
   rule, from which a deviation cannot, or should not, or will not be
   made." This, no doubt, refers to the rule of law, which was then and
   there in the United States forming as the organizing principle of the
   judiciary.

   It is hard for us today to understand the great change that took place
   as the early Justices of the Supreme Court set the tone and thus the
   course of their adjudicatory process, a process much envied and
   emulated throughout the world today. Wilson shows us what respect this
   change deserves. After cautioning his audience to proceed with due
   care, he notes the difficulty of exact definitions of laws. Those
   familiar with the inner workings of high American courts, as evidenced
   by their public opinions, know well that spirit, derived from
   experience, does more to further the ends of justice than dead, though
   righteously inclined, logic. "Influenced by these admonitory truths, I
   hesitate, at present, to give a definition of law." (Second chapter.)
   Wilson, a man widely read and well accustomed to the rigors of
   philosophy, shows a gentleness here which many partisans can admire.

   He then proceeds, boldly, to state the fundamental issue: "If the
   prince, who makes laws for a people, is superior, in the terms of the
   definition, to the people, who are to obey; how comes he to be vested
   with the superiority over them?" We take for granted today the many
   sacrifices made across the centuries in order to answer this great
   question. One suspects he was not simply writing for his contemporary
   Americans, nor indeed simply for Americans, when he goes on to write:
   "Despotism, by an artful use of 'superiority' in politicks; and
   scepticism, by an artful use of 'ideas' in metaphysics, have
   endeavoured - and their endeavours have frequently been attended with
   too much success - to destroy all true liberty and sound philosophy. By
   their baneful effects, the science of man and the science of government
   have been poisoned to their very fountains." Having made the necessary
   attempt at clearing the theoretical grounds for construction ("We now
   see, how necessary it is to lay the foundations of knowledge deep and
   solid."), Wilson leads his students through a tour of near recent
   thinkers (Locke, Blackstone, etc.). Hesitant though he may be, he pulls
   no punches when attacking the enemies of right, whether they be
   politicians, philosophers, or what-you-will, and towards the end of the
   chapter suggests that the American principle or principles are
   intimately connected to not only the law of nature but also to the
   general law of nations. "The immediate objects of our attention are,
   the law of nature, the law of nations, and the municipal law of the
   United States, and of the several states which compose the Union."
   (Second chapter.)

   The third chapter discusses a topic not much in fashion in law schools
   today, the law of nature. Understandable, many students will skim this
   section; but perhaps equally understandably they do themselves a
   disservice if their hope is to deepen their knowledge of the Original
   Intent of the Framers. The Constitution took shape in an environment in
   which discussion of natural law occupied a position of high, if not the
   highest, importance. At the least, a sober assessment of the strengths
   and weaknesses of American constitutionalism requires a minor degree of
   familiarity with the issues Wilson lays out in this chapter.

   The fourth chapter is entitled "Of the Law of nations," situating the
   United States within the broader context. The fifth deals with
   municipal law, in a sense perhaps different from how we understand the
   term today. The sixth deals with man as an individual, a topic of great
   interest to many liberal legal scholars and activists. The seventh, "Of
   Man, as a member of society," is readily seen as an extension of the
   preceding chapter into the tension we generally take for granted today.
   The eighth, "Of man, as a member of a confederation," was likely of
   great interest to knowing political players of the day, but of
   relatively little interest in post-Civil War America. But this is more
   than amply made up by the succeeding chapter, "Of man, as a member of
   the great commonwealth of nations," the title of which suggests the
   Adam Smith book of 1776. "Of government," is the tenth; and "Comparison
   of the constitution of the United States, with that of Great Britain,"
   closes out the first volume.

The question of federalism[edit]

   In essence, the Constitution is a compromise between two extremes
   feared by the framers: the development of a British-like monarchy on
   one end of the spectrum, and the ineffectiveness of an overly
   decentralized government on the other. The balance reached was the
   model of federalism; a binary structure of management composed of
   divided powers between the governments of each of the states and a
   centralized federal government.

   Supporters of federalism believed that a division of power between
   federal and state governments would decrease the likelihood of tyranny,
   which on a federal level would be much more concerning than its
   occurrence locally. The framers felt the states were in the best
   position to restrict such movements.^[3] Another frequently raised
   value of federalism is the notion that since the states are much closer
   to the people, they can be more responsive to and effective in
   resolving the localized concerns of the public.^[4] Accordingly, the
   Constitution explicitly enumerates the powers given to the federal
   government and bestows the remaining discretion to the states.

   In order to create a cohesive government, the framers felt certain
   powers must have belonged to a centralized authority. Conducting
   foreign affairs, for example, would be severely curtailed if not
   embarked upon in a nationally uniform manner. Similarly, a standardized
   currency was of prime importance for a robust and capable economy. As a
   result, the powers to raise armies, create treaties, and to regulate
   commerce with foreign nations and among the states, among others, were
   given to the federal government.

Powers granted by the Constitution to the federal government[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (January 2007)

The federal commerce power[edit]

   Congress is authorized to "regulate commerce with foreign nations, and
   among the several states, and with the Indian tribes" under Article I,
   Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution.

   Important early cases include United States v. E.C. Knight Co. (1895)
   which held that the federal Sherman Act could not be applied to
   manufacture of sugar because "commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is
   not a part of it." Essentially, the Court cabined commerce as a phase
   of business distinct from other aspects of production.

   In the Shreveport Rate Cases (1914), the Court permitted congressional
   regulation of railroad lines because Congress was regulating the
   "channels of commerce" and although the regulation was on intrastate
   rail lines, the effect of the intrastate lines was direct so as to
   concern interstate commerce. In Schecter Poultry, the Court invalidated
   a federal statute seeking to enforce labor conditions at a
   slaughterhouse for chickens; the Court held the relationship between
   labor conditions and chickens was too indirect - that chickens come to
   rest upon arrival at the slaughterhouse (thereby ending the stream of
   commerce), so whatever happened in the slaughterhouse was not
   Congress's business.

   In these early cases, the Court approached problems formalistically -
   from cabining commerce to a specific zone to a direct/indirect test.
   This continued in the cow case, Stafford v. Wallace, where the court
   articulated a "Stream of Commerce" test; essentially, Stream of
   Commerce conceptualizes commerce as a flow mostly concerned with the
   transportation and packaging of goods and not including acquisition of
   raw materials at the front end and retail of those goods at the tail
   end.

   However, with the Great Depression, there was political pressure for
   increased federal government intervention and the Court increasingly
   deferred to Congress. A seminal case was NLRB v. Jones and Laughlin
   where the Court adopted a realist approach and reasoned that interstate
   commerce is an elastic conception which required the Court to think of
   problems not as falling on either side of a dichotomy but in a more
   nuanced fashion.

   Expansion of Congress's commerce clause power continued with Wickard in
   1942 involving a farmer's refusal to comply with a federal quota.
   Wickard articulated the aggregation principle: that effects of the
   entire class matter rather than composites of the class, so even if the
   single farmer did not substantially affect interstate commerce, all
   farmers - the class to which he belonged - do - they compete with the
   national market.

   With recent cases like Lopez and Morrison, there has been a return to
   formalism - i.e. legal tests created by the Court to determine if
   Congress has overstepped its bounds. In both those cases, the federal
   statutes were invalidated. But in Gonzalez v. Raich (post Lopez and
   Morrison), principles of Wickard were resurrected, leaving the future
   of commerce clause doctrine uncertain.

The spending power[edit]

   Clause 1 of Article I, § 8 grants Congress the power to tax and spend
   "to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United
   States," subject to the qualification that all taxes and duties be
   uniform across the country.

The war, treaty, and foreign affairs powers[edit]

                     (January 2007)

Other federal powers[edit]

   Other federal powers specifically enumerated by Section 8 of Article I
   of the United States Constitution (and generally considered exclusive
   to the federal government) are:
     * to coin money, and to regulate its value;

     * to establish laws governing bankruptcy;

     * to establish post offices (although Congress may allow for the
       establishment of non-governmental mail services by private
       entities);

     * to control the issuance of copyrights and patents (although
       copyrights and patents may also be enforced in state courts);

     * to govern the District of Columbia and all other federal
       properties;

     * to control naturalization (and, implicitly, the immigration) of
       aliens;

     * to enforce "by appropriate legislation" the Thirteenth, Fourteenth,
       and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution (a
       function of the Constitution's Necessary and Proper clause);

     * to propose, by a two-thirds vote, constitutional amendments for
       ratification by three-fourths of the states pursuant to the terms
       of Article V.

Powers reserved by the states[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (January 2007)

   Although, for all practical purposes (as proved by the fact of the U.S.
   Civil War), the federal government does not actually govern by the
   "consent of the states," some of the more important powers reserved by
   the states to themselves in the Constitution are:
     * the power, by "application of two-thirds of the legislatures of the
       several states," to require Congress to convene a constitutional
       convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to or revising
       the terms of the Constitution (see Article V).

Suits against states: effect of the 11th Amendment[edit]

   The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution defines the
   scope of when and in what circumstances a state may be taken to federal
   court. Taken literally, the Amendment prohibits a citizen from suing a
   state in federal court through the sovereign immunity doctrine.
   However, the Court has articulated three exceptions: 1) Particular
   state officials may be sued, 2) States can waive immunity or consent to
   suit, and 3) Congress may authorize suits against a state through the
   abrogation doctrine. However, concerning this latter exception, the
   Supreme Court has held in Seminole Tribe v. Florida that Congress may
   not, outside of the Fourteenth Amendment, authorize federal lawsuits
   against states in abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment's guarantee of
   sovereign state immunity.

Intergovernmental Immunities and Interstate Relations[edit]

   Main article: intergovernmental immunity

   The United States government, its agencies and instrumentalities, are
   immune from state regulation that interferes with federal activities,
   functions, and programs. State laws and regulations cannot
   substantially interfere with an authorized federal program, except for
   minor or indirect regulation, such as state taxation of federal
   employees.

   Enumerated powers of the President

   Several important powers are enumerated to the President under Article
   II, Section 2. These include:
     * Commander-in-chief of the armed forces;
     * Power to pardon offenses against the United States;
     * Power to make treaties (with consent of the Senate); and the
     * Power to appoint judges, ambassadors, and other officers of the
       United States (often requiring Senate consent);

The presidential veto power[edit]

   The Presentment Clause (Article I, Section 7, cl. 2-3) grants the
   president the power to veto Congressional legislation and Congress the
   power to override a presidential veto with a supermajority. Under the
   clause, once a bill has been passed in identical form by both houses of
   Congress, it must be sent ("presented") to the president for action
   before it can become federal law. At that point, the Constitution
   provides the president with three options and 10 days to act.

   First, the president can sign the bill into law. Second, the president
   can veto the legislation by sending the bill back to Congress unsigned
   and with a written statement of his objections. Third, the president
   can choose not to act at all on the bill (i.e., simply decline to sign
   it), which can have one of two effects, depending on the circumstances.
   If Congress is in session, the bill automatically becomes law, without
   the president's signature, after 10 days. If, however, Congress
   adjourned during that 10 day period, the bill fails to become law in a
   procedural device known as the "pocket veto".

   Congress may override a presidential veto by a two-thirds majority vote
   in each house, in which case the bill becomes law.

   The president approves or rejects a bill in its entirety; he is not
   permitted to veto specific provisions. In 1996, Congress passed, and
   President Bill Clinton signed, the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which
   gave the president the power to veto individual items of budgeted
   expenditures in appropriations bills. The Supreme Court subsequently
   declared the line-item veto unconstitutional as a violation of the
   Presentment Clause in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998).
   The Court construed the Constitution's silence on the subject of such
   unilateral presidential action as equivalent to "an express
   prohibition," agreeing with historical material that supported the
   conclusion that statutes may only be enacted "in accord with a single,
   finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure",^[5] and that a
   bill must be approved or rejected by the president in its entirety. The
   Court reasoned that a line-item veto "would authorize the President to
   create a different law--one whose text was not voted on by either House
   of Congress or presented to the President for signature," and therefore
   violates the federal legislative procedure prescribed in Article I,
   Section 7.

Foreign affairs and war powers[edit]

   The president has power as commander in chief to control the army.
   Article I grants congress the power to declare war and raise and
   support the army and the navy. However, Article II grants the president
   the power as commander-in-chief. The Supreme Court rarely addresses the
   issue of the president's use of troops in a war-like situation.
   Challenges to the president's use of troops in a foreign country are
   likely to be dismissed on political question grounds. The Supreme Court
   does not review political questions like who to go to war with or how
   to handle rebellions since that is the power of the Federal Executive
   and Legislative branches.

   Prisoners of War must be afforded the due process of having the ability
   to have their writs of Habeas Corpus heard.

   Finally, the War Powers Resolution states that the president as
   commander in chief may introduce the United States Armed Forces into
   hostilities or situations where hostilities appear imminent "only
   pursuant to 1. a declaration of war, 2. specific statutory
   authorization or 3. a national emergency created by attack upon the
   United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces." It
   requires that the president consult with Congress, where possible,
   before introducing troops into hostilities and that the president
   report to Congress within 48 hours after troops are introduced into
   hostilities or in situations which risk imminent involvement in
   hostilities. Unless congress has declared war or granted an extension,
   the president must withdraw troops within 60 days. The president can
   automatically get a 30 day extension by certifying to congress that
   there is an unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of the
   armed forces.

Appointment and removal of executive personnel[edit]

   Article II, Section 2 grants the President the power, with the "advice
   and consent of the Senate," to appoint "ambassadors,... judges of the
   Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose
   appointments are not otherwise provided for" in the Constitution. This
   includes members of the cabinet, top-level agency officials, Article
   III judges, US Attorneys, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, among
   many other positions. Under the modern interpretation of "advice and
   consent," a presidential appointment must be confirmed by majority vote
   in the Senate in order to take effect. Thus, in practice, the President
   holds the power to nominate, while the Senate holds the power to
   confirm.

   Article II, Section 2 gives Congress the discretion to vest the
   appointment of "inferior officers" in either the President alone, the
   heads of departments, or the lower federal courts. Congress may not
   appropriate this role for itself, and Senate confirmation is not
   required for these positions.

   The President has the authority to remove most high-level executive
   officers at will. Congress, however, may place limitations on the
   removal of certain executive appointees serving in positions where
   independence from the presidency is considered desirable, such as
   stipulating that removal may only be for cause.

Legislative and executive immunity[edit]

   Legislative Immunity

   Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives have absolute
   immunity for all statements made on the floor of Congress (Art. I Sec.
   6).

   Executive Immunity

   As a general rule, sitting presidents enjoy immunity from civil suit
   for damages arising from actions taken while in office. This rule was
   significantly curtailed by the Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v.
   Jones, which held that sitting Presidents could in fact be sued for
   actions undertaken before taking office or for actions which are
   unrelated to the presidential office.

The Takings Clause[edit]

   Generally speaking, the Fifth Amendment prevents the government from
   taking private property "for public use without just compensation."
   This prohibition on takings is applicable to the 50 states through the
   Fourteenth Amendment. A governmental taking includes not only physical
   appropriations of property but also government action that
   significantly reduces property or impairs its use.

   A government "taking" must be distinguished from a government
   "regulation." With a taking, the government must fairly compensate the
   property owner when the property is taken for public use. If the
   government regulates property, it does not have to pay any
   compensation. A "taking" will be found if there is an actual
   appropriation or destruction of a person's property or a permanent
   physical invasion by the government or by authorization of law. The
   courts may also find a taking where a governmental regulation denies a
   landowner of all economic use unless principles of nuisance or property
   law that existed when the owner acquired the land make the use
   prohibitable.
