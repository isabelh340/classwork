   Political system of the United States.

   The government of the United States of America is the federal
   government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United
   States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories.
   The federal government is composed of three distinct branches:
   legislative, executive and judicial, whose powers are vested by the
   U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal
   courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and
   duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress,
   including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to
   the Supreme Court.

   The full name of the republic is "The United States of America". No
   other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that
   appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which it is a
   party (e.g., Charles T. Schenck v. United States). The terms
   "Government of the United States of America" or "United States
   Government" are often used in official documents to represent the
   federal government as distinct from the states collectively. In casual
   conversation or writing, the term "Federal Government" is often used,
   and the term "National Government" is sometimes used. The terms
   "Federal" and "National" in government agency or program names
   generally indicate affiliation with the federal government (e.g.,
   Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration, etc.). Because the seat of government is in Washington,
   D.C., "Washington" is commonly used as a metonym for the federal
   government.

History

   Diagram of Federal Government and American Union, 1862.

   The outline of the government of the United States is laid out in the
   Constitution. The government was formed in 1789, making the United
   States one of the world's first, if not the first, modern national
   constitutional republic.^[1]

   The United States government is based on the principle of federalism,
   in which power is shared between the federal government and state
   governments. The details of American federalism, including what powers
   the federal government should have and how those powers can be
   exercised, have been debated ever since the adoption of the
   Constitution. Some make the case for expansive federal powers while
   others argue for a more limited role for the central government in
   relation to individuals, the states or other recognized entities.

   Since the U.S. Civil War, the powers of the federal government have
   generally expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that
   time of legislative branch dominance (e.g., the decades immediately
   following the Civil War) or when states' rights proponents have
   succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action,
   executive prerogative or by constitutional interpretation by the
   courts.^[2]^[3]

   One of the theoretical pillars of the United States Constitution is the
   idea of "checks and balances" among the powers and responsibilities of
   the three branches of American government: the executive, the
   legislative and the judiciary. For example, while the legislative
   (Congress) has the power to create law, the executive (President) can
   veto any legislation—an act which, in turn, can be overridden by
   Congress.^[4] The President nominates judges to the nation's highest
   judiciary authority (Supreme Court), but those nominees must be
   approved by Congress. The Supreme Court, in its turn, has the power to
   invalidate as "unconstitutional" any law passed by the Congress. These
   and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below.

Legislative branch

   Main article: United States Congress
   Seal of the United States Congress.svg

   The United States Congress is the legislative branch of the federal
   government. It is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives
   and the Senate.

Powers of Congress

   The Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress. Enumerated in
   Article I, Section 8, these include the powers to levy and collect
   taxes; to coin money and regulate its value; provide for punishment for
   counterfeiting; establish post offices and roads, issue patents, create
   federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, combat piracies and
   felonies, declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a
   navy, make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces, provide
   for, arm and discipline the militia, exercise exclusive legislation in
   the District of Columbia, and to make laws necessary to properly
   execute powers. Over the two centuries since the United States was
   formed, many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the
   federal government. These disputes have often been the subject of
   lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme
   Court.

Makeup of Congress

House of Representatives

   The 435 seats of the House grouped by state

   The House currently consists of 435 voting members, each of whom
   represents a congressional district. The number of representatives each
   state has in the House is based on each state's population as
   determined in the most recent United States Census. All 435
   representatives serve a two-year term. Each state receives a minimum of
   one representative in the House. In order to be elected as a
   representative, an individual must be at least 25 years of age, must
   have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and must live in the
   state that he or she represents. There is no limit on the number of
   terms a representative may serve. In addition to the 435 voting
   members, there are six non-voting members, consisting of five delegates
   and one resident commissioner. There is one delegate each from the
   District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the
   Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the resident
   commissioner from Puerto Rico.^[5]

Senate

   In contrast, the Senate is made up of two senators from each state,
   regardless of population. There are currently 100 senators (two from
   each of the 50 states), who each serve six-year terms. Approximately
   one third of the Senate stands for election every two years.

Different powers

   The House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers. For
   example, the Senate must approve (give "advice and consent" to) many
   important Presidential appointments, including cabinet officers,
   federal judges (including nominees to the Supreme Court), department
   secretaries (heads of federal executive branch departments), U.S.
   military and naval officers, and ambassadors to foreign countries. All
   legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of
   Representatives. The approval of both chambers is required to pass any
   legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the
   President (or, if the President vetoes the bill, both houses of
   Congress then re-pass the bill, but by a two-thirds majority of each
   chamber, in which case the bill becomes law without the President's
   signature). The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in
   the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the
   people. The Constitution also includes the "Necessary and Proper
   Clause", which grants Congress the power to "make all laws which shall
   be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing
   powers." Members of the House and Senate are elected by
   first-past-the-post voting in every state except Louisiana, California
   and Washington, which have runoffs.

Impeachment of federal officers

   Congress has the power to remove the President, federal judges, and
   other federal officers from office. The House of Representatives and
   Senate have separate roles in this process. The House must first vote
   to "impeach" the official. Then, a trial is held in the Senate to
   decide whether the official should be removed from office. Although two
   presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives (Andrew
   Johnson and Bill Clinton), neither of them was removed following trial
   in the Senate.

Congressional procedures

   Article I, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives each
   chamber the power to "determine the rules of its proceedings." From
   this provision were created congressional committees, which do the work
   of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations
   into national matters. The 108th Congress (2003–2005) had 19 standing
   committees in the House and 17 in the Senate, plus four joint permanent
   committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of
   Congress, printing, taxation and the economy. In addition, each house
   may name special, or select, committees to study specific problems.
   Today, much of the congressional workload is borne by subcommittees, of
   which there are some 150.

Powers of Congress

   Main article: Article One of the United States Constitution
   The United States Capitol is the seat of government for Congress.

Congressional oversight

   Main article: Congressional oversight

   Congressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud, protect
   civil liberties and individual rights, ensure executive compliance with
   the law, gather information for making laws and educating the public,
   and evaluate executive performance.^[6]

   It applies to cabinet departments, executive agencies, regulatory
   commissions and the presidency.

   Congress's oversight function takes many forms:
     * Committee inquiries and hearings
     * Formal consultations with and reports from the President
     * Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for
       treaties
     * House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials
     * House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment in the event
       that the President becomes disabled or the office of the Vice
       President falls vacant.
     * Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials
     * Congressional membership: each state is allocated a number of seats
       based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the
       case of D.C.) in the House of Representatives. Each state is
       allocated two Senators regardless of its population. As of January
       2010, the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative
       to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa, the U.S.
       Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Executive branch

   See also: Article Two of the United States Constitution

   The executive power in the federal government is vested in the
   President of the United States,^[7] although power is often delegated
   to the Cabinet members and other officials.^[8]^[9] The President and
   Vice President are elected as running mates by the Electoral College,
   for which each state, as well as the District of Columbia, is allocated
   a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible
   representation, in the case of D.C.) in both houses of
   Congress.^[7]^[10] The President is limited to a maximum of two
   four-year terms.^[11] If the President has already served two years or
   more of a term to which some other person was elected, he may only
   serve one more additional four-year term.^[7]

President

   Main article: President of the United States
   Seal of the President of the United States.svg

   The executive branch consists of the President and those to whom the
   President's powers are delegated. The President is both the head of
   state and government, as well as the military commander-in-chief and
   chief diplomat. The President, according to the Constitution, must
   "take care that the laws be faithfully executed", and "preserve,
   protect and defend the Constitution". The President presides over the
   executive branch of the federal government, an organization numbering
   about 5 million people, including 1 million active-duty military
   personnel and 600,000 postal service employees. The forty-fourth and
   current president is Barack Obama.

   The President may sign legislation passed by Congress into law or may
   veto it, preventing it from becoming law unless two-thirds of both
   houses of Congress vote to override the veto. The President may
   unilaterally sign treaties with foreign nations. However, ratification
   of international treaties requires a two-thirds majority vote in the
   Senate. The President may be impeached by a majority in the House and
   removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for
   "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors". The
   President may not dissolve Congress or call special elections but does
   have the power to pardon, or release, criminals convicted of offenses
   against the federal government (except in cases of impeachment), enact
   executive orders, and (with the consent of the Senate) appoint Supreme
   Court justices and federal judges.

Vice President

   Main article: Vice President of the United States
   US Vice President Seal.svg

   The Vice President is the second-highest executive official in rank of
   the government. As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession,
   the Vice President becomes President upon the death, resignation, or
   removal of the President, which has happened nine times in U.S.
   history. Under the Constitution, the Vice President is President of the
   Senate. By virtue of this role, he or she is the head of the Senate. In
   that capacity, the Vice President is allowed to vote in the Senate, but
   only when necessary to break a tie vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth
   Amendment, the Vice President presides over the joint session of
   Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.
   While the Vice President's only constitutionally prescribed functions,
   aside from presidential succession, relate to his or her role as
   President of the Senate, the office is now commonly viewed as a member
   of the executive branch of the federal government. The U.S.
   Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch,
   causing scholars to dispute whether it belongs to the executive branch,
   the legislative branch, or both.^[12]^[13]

Cabinet, executive departments and agencies

   Main articles: United States Cabinet and List of United States federal
   agencies

   The day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws is in the
   hands of the various federal executive departments, created by Congress
   to deal with specific areas of national and international affairs. The
   heads of the 15 departments, chosen by the President and approved with
   the "advice and consent" of the U.S. Senate, form a council of advisers
   generally known as the President's "Cabinet". In addition to
   departments, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the
   Executive Office of the President. These include the White House staff,
   the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the
   Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality, the
   Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug
   Control Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The
   employees in these United States government agencies are called federal
   civil servants.

   There are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal
   Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the
   Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency,
   and the United States Agency for International Development. In
   addition, there are government-owned corporations such as the Federal
   Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger
   Corporation.

Judicial branch

   Main article: United States federal courts
   See also: Article Three of the United States Constitution

   The Judiciary explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by
   hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases.
   Seal of the United States Supreme Court.svg

Overview of the federal judiciary

   Article III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court
   of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to
   establish inferior courts as their need shall arise. Section I also
   establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that
   their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office.
   Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be
   appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate.

   The Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into
   judicial districts and created federal courts for each district. The
   three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of
   the national judiciary: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94
   district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction. Congress
   retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower
   than the Supreme Court.

   The U.S. Supreme Court adjudicates "cases and controversies"—matters
   pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and
   interpretation of the United States Constitution, and, in general, can
   declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the
   government as unconstitutional, nullifying the law and creating
   precedent for future law and decisions. The United States Constitution
   does not grant the judicial branch the power of judicial review (the
   power to declare a law Unconstitutional). The power of judicial review
   was asserted by Chief Justice Marshall in the landmark Supreme Court
   Case Marbury v. Madison (1803). There have been instances in the past
   where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches.
   Below the U.S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals,
   and below them in turn are the United States District Courts, which are
   the general trial courts for federal law, and for certain controversies
   between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state
   ("diversity jurisdiction").

   There are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction,
   meaning that these courts handle criminal cases and civil lawsuits
   between individuals. The other courts, such as the bankruptcy courts
   and the Tax Court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds
   of cases ("subject matter jurisdiction"). The Bankruptcy Courts are
   "under" the district courts, and as such are not considered part of the
   "Article III" judiciary and also as such their judges do not have
   lifetime tenure, nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution
   of their remuneration. Also the Tax Court is not an Article III court
   (but is, instead an "Article I Court").

   The district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are
   considered under the Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code)
   consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of "federal question
   jurisdiction" and "diversity jurisdiction" and "pendent jurisdiction"
   can be filed and decided. The district courts can also hear cases under
   "removal jurisdiction", wherein a case brought in State court meets the
   requirements for diversity jurisdiction, and one party litigant chooses
   to "remove" the case from state court to federal court.

   The United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear
   appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct
   appeals from administrative agencies, and some interlocutory appeals.
   The U.S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts
   of appeals or state supreme courts, and in addition has original
   jurisdiction over a small number of cases.

   The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an
   Act of Congress; a U.S. treaty; cases affecting ambassadors, ministers
   and consuls of foreign countries in the U.S.; cases and controversies
   to which the federal government is a party; controversies between
   states (or their citizens) and foreign nations (or their citizens or
   subjects); and bankruptcy cases (collectively "federal-question
   jurisdiction"). The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal
   jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs
   and the government of another state was the defendant. It did not
   disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a
   plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant.

   The power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for
   damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal
   law. The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted
   in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts.
   Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law
   pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, state courts can decide certain
   matters involving federal law, and a handful of federal claims are
   primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts (for example,
   those arising from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991). Both
   court systems thus can be said to have exclusive jurisdiction in some
   areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others.

   The U.S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing
   that federal judges shall hold office "during good behavior"; in
   practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or
   resign. A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached
   in the same way as the President or other officials of the federal
   government. U.S. judges are appointed by the President, subject to
   confirmation by the Senate. Another Constitutional provision prohibits
   Congress from reducing the pay of any Article III judge (Congress is
   able to set a lower salary for all future judges that take office after
   the reduction, but may not decrease the rate of pay for judges already
   in office).

Relationships between state and federal courts

   Separate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court
   system are the court systems of each state, each dealing with, in
   addition to federal law when not deemed preempted, a state's own laws,
   and having its own court rules and procedures. Although state
   governments and the federal government are legally dual sovereigns, the
   Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court
   from the State Supreme Courts (e.g., absent the Court countenancing the
   applicability of the doctrine of adequate and independent State
   grounds). The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the
   final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state's laws
   and Constitution. Many state constitution provisions are equal in
   breadth to those of the U.S. Constitution, but are considered
   "parallel" (thus, where, for example, the right to privacy pursuant to
   a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy, and
   the asserted ground is explicitly held to be "independent", the
   question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court—the U.S.
   Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction).

   A State Supreme Court, other than of its own accord, is bound only by
   the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law, but is not
   bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals
   for the federal circuit in which the state is included, or even the
   federal district courts located in the state, a result of the dual
   sovereigns concept. Conversely, a federal district court hearing a
   matter involving only a question of state law (usually through
   diversity jurisdiction) must apply the substantive law of the state in
   which the court sits, a result of the application of the Erie Doctrine;
   however, at the same time, the case is heard under the Federal Rules of
   Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the
   Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules (that is,
   the application of the Erie Doctrine only extends to a requirement that
   a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply substantive
   state law, but not procedural state law, which may be different).
   Together, the laws of the federal and state governments form U.S. law.

Elections and voting

   Main article: Elections in the United States

   Suffrage, commonly known as the ability to vote, has changed
   significantly over time. In the early years of the United States,
   voting was considered a matter for state governments, and was commonly
   restricted to white men who owned land. Direct elections were mostly
   held only for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures,
   although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied
   from state to state. Under this original system, both senators
   representing each state in the U.S. Senate were chosen by a majority
   vote of the state legislature. Since the ratification of the
   Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have
   been directly elected. Today, U.S. citizens have almost universal
   suffrage from the age of 18, regardless of race, gender, or wealth. The
   only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of
   convicted felons, and in some states former felons as well.

   Under the U.S. Constitution, the national representation of territories
   and the federal district of Washington, D.C., in Congress is limited:
   residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and
   federal taxes, but their only congressional representative is a
   non-voting delegate. Residents of U.S. territories have varying rights;
   for example, only some residents of Puerto Rico pay federal income
   taxes (though all residents must pay all other federal taxes, including
   import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes and federal payroll taxes,
   including Social Security and Medicare). All federal laws that are "not
   locally inapplicable" are automatically the law of the land in Puerto
   Rico but their current representation in the U.S. Congress is in the
   form of a Resident Commissioner, a nonvoting delegate.^[14]

State, tribal and local governments

   Main articles: State governments of the United States, Tribal
   sovereignty in the United States and Local government in the United
   States
   The states of the United States as divided into counties (or, in
   Louisiana and Alaska, parishes and boroughs, respectively). Alaska and
   Hawaii are not to scale and the Aleutian and uninhabited Northwestern
   Hawaiian Islands have been omitted.

   The state governments tend to have the greatest influence over most
   Americans' daily lives. The Tenth Amendment to the United States
   Constitution prohibits the federal government from exercising any power
   not delegated to it by the States in the Constitution; as a result,
   states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals
   within their jurisdiction. Because state governments are not authorized
   to print currency, they generally have to raise revenue through either
   taxes or bonds. As a result, state governments tend to impose severe
   budget cuts at any time the economy is faltering, which are strongly
   felt by the public for which they are responsible.^[15]

   Each state has its own written constitution, government and code of
   laws. The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have, "a
   Republican Government". Therefore, there are often great differences in
   law and procedure between individual states, concerning issues such as
   property, crime, health and education, amongst others. The highest
   elected official of each state is the Governor. Each state also has an
   elected state legislature (bicameralism is a feature of every state
   except Nebraska), whose members represent the voters of the state. Each
   state maintains its own state court system. In some states, supreme and
   lower court justices are elected by the people; in others, they are
   appointed, as they are in the federal system.

   As a result of the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia, American
   Indian tribes are considered "domestic dependent nations" that operate
   as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but, generally
   and where possible, outside of the jurisdiction of state governments.
   Hundreds of laws, executive orders and court cases have modified the
   governmental status of tribes vis-à-vis individual states, but the two
   have continued to be recognized as separate bodies. Tribal capacity to
   operate robust governments varies, from a simple council used to manage
   all aspects of tribal affairs, to large and complex bureaucracies with
   several branches of government. Tribes are empowered to form their own
   governments, with power resting in elected tribal councils, elected
   tribal chairpersons, or religiously appointed leaders (as is the case
   with pueblos). Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically
   restricted to individuals of native descent, but tribes are free to set
   whatever citizenship requirements they wish.

   The institutions that are responsible for local government within
   states are typically town, city, or county boards, water management
   districts, fire management districts, library districts and other
   similar governmental units which make laws that affect their particular
   area. These laws concern issues such as traffic, the sale of alcohol
   and the keeping of animals. The highest elected official of a town or
   city is usually the mayor. In New England, towns operate in a direct
   democratic fashion, and in some states, such as Rhode Island and
   Connecticut, counties have little or no power, existing only as
   geographic distinctions. In other areas, county governments have more
   power, such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies.

   14. ^ Contrary to common misconception, residents of Puerto Rico do pay
       U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned
       to the Puerto Rico Treasury) (See Department of the Interior,
       Office of Insular Affairs.), import/export taxes (See
       Stanford.wellsphere.com), federal commodity taxes (See
       Stanford.wellsphere.com), social security taxes (See IRS.gov), etc.
       Residents pay federal payroll taxes, such as Social Security (See
       IRS.gov) and Medicare (See Reuters.com), as well as Commonwealth of
       Puerto Rico income taxes (See Puertorico-herald.com and
       HTRCPA.com). All federal employees (See Heritage.org), those who do
       business with the federal government (See MCVPR.com), Puerto
       Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S. (See
       Page 9, line 1.), and some others (For example, Puerto Rican
       residents that are members of the U.S. military, See Heritage.org
       and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside
       Puerto Rico, See pp 14-15.) also pay federal income taxes. In
       addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower
       than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income
       in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on
       the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the
       local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the
       island. This occurs because "the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
       government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State
       and local governments" (See GAO.gov). As residents of Puerto Rico
       pay into Social Security, Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social
       Security benefits upon retirement, but are excluded from the
       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
       residents, unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern
       Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States, do not receive the
       SSI. See Socialsecurity.gov), and the island actually receives less
       than 15% of the Medicaid funding it would normally receive if it
       were a U.S. state. However, Medicare providers receive
       less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to
       beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully
       into the system (See p. 252). It has also been estimated (See
       Eagleforum.org that, because the population of the island is
       greater than that of 50% of the states, if it were a state, Puerto
       Rico would have six to eight seats in the House, in addition to the
       two seats in the Senate.(See Eagleforum.org, CRF-USA.org and
       Thomas.gov [Note that for the later, the official US Congress
       database website, you will need to resubmit a query. The document
       in question is called "House Report 110-597 - Puerto Rico Democracy
       Act of 2007." These are the steps to follow: Thomas.gov > Committee
       Reports > 110 > drop down "Word/Phrase" and pick "Report Number" >
       type "597" next to Report Number. This will provide the document
       "House Report 110-597 - Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007", then
       from the Table of Contents choose "Background and need for
       legislation".]). Another misconception is that the import/export
       taxes collected by the U.S. on products manufactured in Puerto Rico
       are all returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury. This is not the case.
       Such import/export taxes are returned only for rum products, and
       even then the US Treasury keeps a portion of those taxes (See the
       "House Report 110-597 - Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007"
       mentioned above.)
