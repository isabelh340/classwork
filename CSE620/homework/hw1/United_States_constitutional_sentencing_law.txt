   The United States Constitution contains several provisions related to
   criminal sentencing.

   The Excessive Fines Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause
   of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit
   certain disproportionate sentences. Further, the Cruel and Unusual
   Punishments Clause prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for
   certain crimes, for certain classes of defendants, and in the absence
   of certain procedures. The Sixth Amendment to the United States
   Constitution prohibits increasing the maximum authorized sentence for
   an offense based on a fact not found by a jury. Mandatory minimums
   based on judicial fact-finding are not prohibited. The Double Jeopardy
   Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution
   prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense. The test of
   Blockburger v. United States (1932) is whether each crime contains an
   element that the other does not.

Eighth Amendment[edit]

   The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:

          [N]or [shall] excessive [be] fines imposed, nor cruel and
          unusual punishments inflicted.^[1]

Excessive fines[edit]

   United States v. Bajakajian (1998) is the first and only case in which
   the Supreme Court has declared a criminal fine constitutionally
   excessive. There, the government sought the forfeiture of $357,144 from
   Hosep Krikor Bajakajian solely as a penalty for not declaring that
   amount to Customs when leaving the country.^[2]

   The Excessive Fines Clause applies to forfeitures of property,^[3] but
   does not apply to punitive damages in civil suits.^[4]

Cruel and unusual punishments[edit]

   Further information: Cruel and unusual punishment

Non-capital sentences[edit]

   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause regulates non-capital
   sentences far less closely than capital sentences. As a threshold
   inquiry, the Court will not inquire into a non-capital sentence unless
   the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate, even after deferring
   to the legislature.^[5] Next, the Court engages in a three-factor test,
   considering: (1) the gravity of offesne, (2) an inter-jurisdictional
   comparison of the sentences for crime, and (3) an intra-jurisdictional
   comparison of the sentence given.^[6]

   For example, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of the
   sentence of life without the possibility of parole on juvenile
   offenders if they did not commit homicide,^[7] or if automatically
   imposed by statute for homicide.^[8]

   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have argued that the Court
   should not engage in Eighth Amendment proportionality review at all.

Capital sentences[edit]

   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause has more to say about capital
   sentences. First, the Clause entirely precludes the use of capital
   punishment for crimes other than murder.^[9] Even with murder, the
   defendant must personally kill, attempt to kill, or intend to
   kill.^[10] Second, the Clause entirely precludes the use of capital
   punishment against certain classes of defendants, such as the
   insane,^[11] the mentally retarded,^[12] juveniles at the time of the
   crime,^[13] and those who are not competent at the time of the
   execution.^[14]

   Third, the Clause prevents the arbitrary and discriminatory use of the
   death penalty.^[15] Nor can the death penalty be mandatory for those
   convicted of a certain offense.^[16] Aggravating factors must be found
   by a jury.^[17] Aggravating factors cannot be vague.^[18] The
   sentencing decision-maker must have the authority to consider all
   mitigating factors.^[19]

   Fourth, the Clause requires certain additional procedural rules in
   capital cases. For example, the jury must be permitted to consider a
   lesser included offense.^[20] Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) held that
   jurisdictions could permit prosecutors for-cause strikes of jurors who
   would never impose the death penalty, but not jurors who were merely
   opposed to the death penalty.^[21] Such a jury is known as a
   death-qualified jury. Similarly, the defendant must be allowed to
   challenge for cause a juror who would impose the death penalty in every
   capital case.^[22]

Facts not found by a jury[edit]

   Article Three, Section Two of the United States Constitution provides:

          Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by
          Jury . . . .^[23]

   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          to a . . . trial, by an impartial jury . . . .^[24]

   The Supreme Court has held that every fact that increases the maximum
   authorized sentence must be named in the charging instrument, submitted
   to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubtâ€”whether or not
   statutory law labels that fact as an element of the offense or a
   sentencing factor.^[25] The only exception is the fact of prior
   conviction, which may be found by a judge.^[26] Because the relevant
   maximum is the authorized sentences that arises from the fact of
   conviction alone, without additional fact-finding, this principle
   invalidates mandatory sentencing guidelines that are the equivalent of
   increasing the maximum authorized sentence.^[27]

   In contrast, mandatory minimum sentences may rely on judicial
   fact-finding, as long as the minimum does not exceed the maximum for
   the facts found by the jury.^[28] Nor does this principle prevent the
   judge from deciding whether the sentences stemming from a multi-count
   indictment will be concurrent or consecutively based on judicial
   fact-finding.^[29]

   This rule was not retroactively applied in habeas cases.^[30] And, it
   is subject to the principles of harmless error analysis.^[31]

Double jeopardy[edit]

   Main article: Double Jeopardy Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. V provides:

          [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be
          twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .^[32]

   The Double Jeopardy Clause, inter alia, prohibits multiple punishment
   for the same offense In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the
   Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may
   separately punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains
   an element that the other does not.^[33] Blockburger is the default
   rule, unless the legislatively intends to depart; for example,
   Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from
   its predicates,^[34] as can conspiracy.^[35]

Due process[edit]

   Further information: Due Process Clause

   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:

          [N]or shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or
          property, without due process of law . . . .^[32]

   The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:

          [N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
          property, without due process of law . . . .^[36]

   In Williams v. New York (1949), the Supreme Court held that due process
   does not require the use of ordinary evidentiary rules at
   sentencing.^[37]
