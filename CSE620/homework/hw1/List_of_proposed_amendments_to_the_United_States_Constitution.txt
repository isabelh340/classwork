   This list contains proposed amendments to the United States
   Constitution. Article Five of the United States Constitution provides
   for two methods for proposing and two methods for the ratification of
   an amendment. An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both
   the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a national convention
   called by Congress at the request of 2/3 of the state legislatures. The
   latter procedure has never been used. Upon adoption by the Congress or
   a national convention, an amendment must then be ratified by 3/4 of the
   state legislatures or by special state ratifying conventions in 3/4 of
   the states. The decision of which ratification method will be used for
   any given amendment is Congress' alone to make.^[1] Only for the 21st
   amendment was the latter procedure invoked and followed.

   Collectively, members of the House and Senate typically propose around
   200 amendments during each two–year term of Congress.^[2] Most however,
   never get out of the Congressional committees in which they were
   proposed, and only a fraction of those that do receive enough support
   to win Congressional approval to actually go through the constitutional
   ratification process.

   Only 33 such proposals have been adopted by Congress since 1798 and
   presented to the states for ratification, and of these, only 27 have
   been ratified. The framers of the Constitution, recognizing the
   difference between regular legislation and constitutional matters,
   intended that it be difficult to change the Constitution; but not so
   difficult as to render it an inflexible instrument of government, as
   the amendment mechanism in the Articles of Confederation, which
   required a unanimous vote of 13 states for ratification, had proven to
   be. Therefore, a less stringent process for amending the Constitution
   was established in Article V.

   The framers of the Constitution included a proviso at the end of
   Article V shielding three clauses in the new frame of government from
   being amended. They are: Article I, Section 9, Clause 1, concerning the
   migration and importation of slaves; Article I, Section 9, Clause 4,
   concerning Congress' taxing power; and, Article I, Section 3, Clause 1,
   which provides for equal representation of the states in the Senate.
   These are the only textually entrenched provisions of the Constitution.
   The shield protecting the first two entrenched clauses was absolute but
   of limited duration; it was in force only until 1808. The shield
   protecting the third entrenched clause, though less absolute than that
   covering the others, is practically permanent; it will be in force
   until there is unanimous agreement among the states favoring a change.

   Beginning in the early 20th century, Congress has usually, but not
   always, stipulated that an amendment must be ratified by the required
   number of states within seven years from the date of its submission to
   the states in order to become part of the Constitution. Congress'
   authority to set ratification deadline was affirmed by the United
   States Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939).
   The mechanism for amending the United States Constitution was developed
   during the closing days of the 1787 Constitutional Convention at
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Amending process[edit]

   Main article: Article Five of the United States Constitution

   Amending the United States Constitution is a two-step process.
   Proposals to amend it must be properly Adopted and Ratified before
   becoming operative.

   A proposed amendment may be adopted and sent to the states for
   ratification by either:
     * The United States Congress, whenever a two-thirds majority in both
       the Senate and the House of Representatives deem it necessary;

          OR

     * A national convention, called by Congress for this purpose, on the
       application of the legislatures of two thirds (presently 34) of the
       states.

   To become part of the Constitution, an adopted amendment must be
   ratified by either (as determined by Congress):
     * The legislatures of three-fourths (presently 38) of the states,
       within the stipulated time period—if any;

          OR

     * State ratifying conventions in three-fourths (presently 38) of the
       states, within the stipulated time period—if any.

   Upon being properly ratified, an amendment becomes an operative
   addition to the Constitution.

Unratified Amendments[edit]

   Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been
   ratified by the required number of states. Four of these, including one
   of the twelve Bill of Rights amendments, are still technically open and
   pending. The other two amendments are closed and no longer pending, one
   by terms set within the Congressional Resolution proposing it (†) and
   the other by terms set within the body of the amendment (‡).
     * Congressional Apportionment Amendment (pending since September 25,
       1789; ratified by 11 states)

                Would strictly regulate the size of congressional
                districts for representation in the House of
                Representatives.

     * Titles of Nobility Amendment (pending since May 1, 1810; ratified
       by 12 states)

                Would strip citizenship from any United States citizen who
                accepts a title of nobility from a foreign country.

     * Corwin Amendment (pending since March 2, 1861; ratified by 3
       states)

                Would make "domestic institutions" (which in 1861
                implicitly meant slavery) of the states impervious to the
                constitutional amendment procedures enshrined within
                Article Five of the United States Constitution and immune
                to abolition or interference even by the most compelling
                Congressional and popular majorities.

     * Child Labor Amendment (pending since June 2, 1924; ratified by 28
       states)

                Would empower the federal government to regulate child
                labor.

     * Equal Rights Amendment (Ratification period, March 22, 1972 to
       March 22, 1979/June 30, 1982, amendment failed (†); ratified by 35
       states)

                Would have prohibited deprivation of equality of rights
                (discrimination) by the federal or state governments on
                account of sex.

     * District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment (Ratification period,
       August 22, 1978 to August 22, 1985, Amendment failed(‡); ratified
       by 16 states)

                Would have granted the District of Columbia full
                representation in the United States Congress as if it were
                a state, repealed the 23rd Amendment and granted the
                District full representation in the Electoral College
                system in addition to full participation in the process by
                which the Constitution is amended.

Proposed amendments not approved by Congress[edit]

   Approximately 11,539 measures have been proposed to amend the
   Constitution from 1789 through January 2, 2013.^[4] The following
   amendments, while introduced by a member of Congress, either died in
   committee or did not receive a two-thirds vote in both houses of
   Congress and were therefore not sent to the states for ratification.

19th century[edit]

   Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States (1861–1865)

   Over 1,300 resolutions containing over 1,800 proposals to amend the
   constitution had been submitted before Congress during the first
   century of its adoption.^[5] Some prominent proposals included:
     * Blaine Amendment, proposed in 1875, would have banned public funds
       from going to religious purposes, in order to prevent Catholics
       from taking advantage of such funds. Though it failed to pass, many
       states adopted such provisions.
     * Christian Amendment, proposed first in February 1863, would have
       added acknowledgment of the Christian God in the Preamble to the
       Constitution. Similar amendments were proposed in 1874, 1896 and
       1910 with none passing. The last attempt in 1954 did not come to a
       vote.
     * The Crittenden Compromise, a joint resolution that included six
       constitutional amendments that would protect slavery. Both the
       House of Representatives and the Senate rejected it in 1861 and
       Abraham Lincoln was elected on a platform that opposed the
       expansion of slavery. The South's reaction to the rejection paved
       the way for the secession of the Confederate states and the
       American Civil War.

20th century[edit]

   Harry Blackmun wrote the Supreme Court’s opinion in the controversial
   Roe v. Wade decision.
     * Anti-Miscegenation Amendment was proposed by Representative Seaborn
       Roddenbery, a Democrat from Georgia, in 1912 to forbid interracial
       marriages nationwide. Similar amendments were proposed by
       Congressman Andrew King, a Missourian Democrat, in 1871 and by
       Senator Coleman Blease, a South Carolinian Democrat, in 1928. None
       was passed by Congress.
     * Anti-Polygamy Amendment, proposed by Representative Frederick
       Gillett, a Massachusetts Republican, on January 24, 1914, and
       supported by former U.S. Senator from Utah and anti-Mormon
       activist, Frank J. Cannon, and by the National Reform
       Association.^[6]
     * Bricker Amendment, proposed in 1951 by Ohio Senator John W.
       Bricker, would have limited the federal government's treaty-making
       power. Opposed by President Dwight Eisenhower, it failed twice to
       reach the threshold of two-thirds of voting members necessary for
       passage, the first time by eight votes and the second time by
       single vote.^[7]
     * Death Penalty Abolition Amendment was proposed in 1990, 1992, 1993,
       and 1995 by Representative Henry González to prohibit the
       imposition of capital punishment "by any State, Territory, or other
       jurisdiction within the United States". The amendment was referred
       to the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, but never made it
       out of committee.
     * Flag Desecration Amendment was first proposed in 1968 to give
       Congress the power to make acts such as flag burning illegal.
       During each term of Congress from 1995 to 2005, the proposed
       amendment was passed by the House of Representatives, but never by
       the Senate, coming closest during voting on June 27, 2006, with 66
       in support and 34 opposed (one vote short).
     * Human Life Amendment, first proposed in 1973, would overturn the
       Roe v. Wade court ruling. A total of 330 proposals using varying
       texts have been proposed with almost all dying in committee. The
       only version that reached a formal floor vote, the Hatch-Eagleton
       Amendment, was rejected by 18 votes in the Senate on June 28, 1983.
     * Ludlow Amendment was proposed by Representative Louis Ludlow in
       1937. This amendment would have heavily reduced America's ability
       to be involved in war.

21st century[edit]

     * A balanced budget amendment, in which Congress and the President
       are forced to balance the budget every year, has been introduced
       many times.^[8]
     * School Prayer Amendment proposed on April 9, 2003, to establish
       that "The people retain the right to pray and to recognize their
       religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property,
       including schools."^[9]
     * God in the Pledge of Allegiance – declaring that it is not an
       establishment of religion for teachers to lead students in reciting
       the Pledge of Allegiance (with the words "one Nation under God"),
       proposed on February 27, 2003, by Oklahoma Representative Frank
       Lucas.^[10]
     * Every Vote Counts Amendment – proposed by Congressman Gene Green on
       September 14, 2004. It would abolish the electoral college.^[11]
     * Continuity of Government Amendment – after a Senate hearing in 2004
       regarding the need for an amendment to ensure continuity of
       government in the event that many members of Congress become
       incapacitated,^[12] Senator John Cornyn introduced an amendment to
       allow Congress to temporarily replace members after at least a
       quarter of either chamber is incapacitated.^[13]
     * Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment – proposed by Senator Orrin
       Hatch. It would allow naturalized citizens with at least twenty
       years' citizenship to become president.
     * Seventeenth Amendment repeal – proposed in 2004 by Georgia Senator
       Zell Miller. It would reinstate the appointment of Senators by
       state legislatures as originally required by Article One, Section
       Three, Clauses One and Three.
     * The Federal Marriage Amendment has been introduced in the United
       States Congress four times: in 2003, 2004, 2005/2006 and 2008 by
       multiple members of Congress (with support from then-President
       George W. Bush). It would define marriage and prohibit same-sex
       marriage, even at the state level.
     * Twenty-second Amendment repeal – proposed as early as 1989, various
       congressmen, including Rep. Barney Frank, Rep. Steny Hoyer, Rep.
       José Serrano,^[14] Rep. Howard Berman, and Sen. Harry Reid,^[15]
       have introduced legislation, but each resolution died before making
       it out of its respective committee. The current amendment limits
       the president to two elected terms in office, and up to two years
       succeeding a President in office. Last action was On January 4,
       2013, Rep. José Serrano once again introduced H.J.Res. 15 proposing
       an Amendment to repeal the 22nd Amendment, as he has done every two
       years since 1997.^[16]
     * On January 16, 2009, Senator David Vitter of Louisiana proposed an
       amendment which would have denied US citizenship to anyone born in
       the US unless at least one parent were a US citizen, a permanent
       resident, or in the armed forces.^[17]
     * On February 25, 2009, Senator Lisa Murkowski, because she believed
       the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 would be
       unconstitutional if adopted, proposed a Constitutional amendment
       that would provide a Representative to the District of
       Columbia.^[18]
     * On November 11, 2009, Senator Jim DeMint proposed term limits for
       the U.S. Congress, where the limit for senators will be two terms
       for a total of 12 years and for representatives, three terms for a
       total of six years.^[19]
     * On November 15, 2011, Representative James P. McGovern introduced
       the People's Rights Amendment, a proposal to limit the
       Constitution's protections only to the rights of natural persons,
       and not corporations. This amendment would overturn the United
       States Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal
       Election Commission.^[20]
     * On December 8, 2011 Senator Bernie Sanders filed The Saving
       American Democracy Amendment, which would state that corporations
       are not entitled to the same constitutional rights as people. It
       would also ban corporate campaign donations to candidates, and give
       Congress and the states broad authority to regulate spending in
       elections. This amendment would overturn the United States Supreme
       Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election
       Commission.^[21]^[22]
     * Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. backed the Right to Vote Amendment, a
       proposal to explicitly guarantee the right to vote for all legal
       U.S. citizens and empower Congress to protect this right; he
       introduced a resolution for the amendment in the 107th,^[23]
       108th,^[24] 109th,^[25] 110th,^[26] 111th^[27] and 112th,^[28] all
       of which died in committee. On May 13, 2013, Reps. Mark Pocan and
       Keith Ellison re-introduced the bill.^[29]
