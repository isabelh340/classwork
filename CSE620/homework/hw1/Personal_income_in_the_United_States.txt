   Personal income is an individual’s total earnings from wages,
   investment interest, and other sources. In the United States the most
   widely cited personal income statistics are the Bureau of Economic
   Analysis’s personal income and the Census Bureau’s per capita money
   income. The two statistics spring from different traditions of
   measurement—personal income from national economic accounts and money
   income from household surveys. BEA's statistics relate personal income
   to measures of production, including GDP, and is considered an
   indicator of consumer spending. Census's statistics provide detail on
   income distribution and demographics and are used to produce the
   nation's official poverty statistics. Inflation-adjusted ("real")
   per-capita disposable personal income rose steadily in the U.S. from
   1945 to 2008, but has since remained generally level.^[2]^[3]

   Income patterns are evident on the basis of age, sex, race and
   educational characteristics. In 2005 roughly half of all those with
   graduate degrees were among the nation's top 15% of income earners.
   Among different demographics (sex, marital status, race, gender) for
   those over the age of 18, median personal income ranged from $3,317 for
   an unemployed, married Asian American female^[4] to $55,935 for a
   full-time, year-round employed Asian American male.^[5] According to
   the US Census men tended to have higher income than women while Asians
   and Whites earned more than African Americans and Hispanics. The
   overall median personal income for all individuals over the age of 18
   was $24,062^[6]^[dead link] ($32,140 for those age 25 or above) in the
   year 2005.^[7] The overall median income for all 155 million persons
   over the age of 15 who worked with earnings in 2005 was $28,567.^[8]

   As a reference point, the minimum wage rate in 2009 was $7.25 per hour
   or $15,080 for the 2080 hours in a typical work year. The minimum wage
   is a little more than the poverty level for a single person unit and
   about 50% of the poverty level for a family of four (see Poverty in the
   United States). Annual wages of $30,160; $45,240; $75,400; $150,800 and
   $1.5M correspond to 2, 3, 5, 10 and 100 times minimum wage
   respectively.^[9]

Income statistics[edit]

Personal income and disposable personal income[edit]

   BEA's personal income measures the income received by persons from
   participation in production, from government and business transfers,
   and from holding interest-bearing securities and corporate stocks.
   Personal income also includes income received by nonprofit institutions
   serving households, by private non-insured welfare funds, and by
   private trust funds. BEA also publishes disposable personal income,
   which measures the income available to households after paying federal
   and state and local government income taxes.

   Income from production is generated both by the labor of individuals
   (for example, in the form of wages and salaries and of proprietors’
   income) and by the capital that they own (in the form of rental income
   of persons). Income that is not earned from production in the current
   period—such as capital gains, which relate to changes in the price of
   assets over time—is excluded.

   BEA’s monthly personal income estimates are one of several key
   macroeconomic indicators that the National Bureau of Economic Research
   considers when dating the business cycle.

   Personal income and disposable personal income are provided both as
   aggregate and as per capita statistics. BEA produces monthly estimates
   of personal income for the nation, quarterly estimates of state
   personal income, and annual estimates of local-area personal income.
   More information is found on BEA's website.

Census Money Income[edit]

   The Census Bureau collects income data on several major surveys,
   including the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the
   Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Income and Program
   Participation (SIPP), and the American Community Survey (ACS). The CPS
   is the source of the official national estimates of poverty and the
   most widely cited source of annual household income estimates for the
   United States.^[10]

   The CPS measure of money income is defined as the total pre-tax cash
   income received by people on a regular basis, excluding certain
   lump-sum payments and excluding capital gains.

   The Census Bureau also produces alternative estimates of income and
   poverty based on broadened definitions of income that include many of
   these income components that are not included in money income.

   The Census Bureau releases estimates of household money income as
   medians, percent distributions by income categories, and on a per
   capita basis. Estimates are available by demographic characteristics of
   householders and by the composition of households. More details on
   income concepts and sources are found on the Census Bureau’s website.

Income distribution[edit]

   Of those individuals with income who were older than 15 years of age,
   slightly under 45% had incomes below $25,000 while the top 10.43% had
   incomes exceeding $82,500 a year in 2010. The distribution of income
   among individuals differs substantially from household incomes as 39%
   of all households had two or more income earners. As a result 20.4% of
   households have six figure incomes, even though only 6.61% of Americans
   had incomes exceeding $100,000 in 2010. The following chart shows the
   income distribution among all 243,955,000 individuals aged 15 or higher
   who received income in 2010 as recorded by the United States Census
   Bureau.^[12]

By race and origin[edit]

   Personal income varied significantly with an individual's racial
   characteristics with racial discrepancies having remained largely
   stagnant since 1996. Overall, Asian Americans enjoyed higher median
   personal incomes than any other racial demographic. Asian Americans had
   a median income roughly ten percent higher than that of Whites ^[15]
   The only exception was among the holders of graduate degrees who
   consititute 8.9% of the population. Among those with a Master's,
   Professional or Doctorate degree those who identified as White had the
   highest median individual income.. This racial income gap was
   relatively small.^[15]^[16]

   Those identifying as Hispanic or Latino (who may have been of any
   "race") had the lowest overall median personal income, earning 28.51%
   less than Whites^[16]^[17] and 35% less than Asian Americans.^[15] The
   second largest racial or ethnic gap was between Whites and African
   Americans with the former earning roughly 22% more than the latter.
   Thus one can observe a significant discrepancy with the median income
   of Asians and Whites and that of African Americans and Hispanics.^[18]

   Overall the race gap between African Americans and Whites has remained
   roughly equal between both races over the past decade.^[16]^[19] Both
   races saw a gain in median income between 1996 and 2006, with the
   income growth among African Americans slightly outpacing that of
   Whites. In 1996 the median income for Whites was $5,957 (31%) higher
   than for Blacks. In 2006 the gap in median incomes was nearly identical
   with the median income for Whites being $5,929 (22%) higher than that
   for African Americans. While the gap remains numerically unchanged, the
   percentage difference between the two races has decreased as a result
   of mutual increases in median personal income.^[16]^[19] Measuring
   income by per capita is another way to look at personal earnings by
   race. Unlike median statistics, per capita statistics are affected by
   extremely high and low incomes. According to the U.S Census Bureau "The
   per capita income for the overall population in 2008 was $26,964; for
   non-Hispanic Whites, it was $31,313; for Blacks, it was $18,406; for
   Asians, it was $30,292; and for Hispanics(median of all races within
   group), it was $15,674".^[20]
