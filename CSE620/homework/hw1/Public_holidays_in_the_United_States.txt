Public holidays in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   For constitutional reasons, the United States does not have national
   holidays in the sense that most other nations do, i.e. days on which
   all businesses are closed by law and employees have a day off.^[1]^[not
   in citation given] Pursuant to the Tenth Amendment, the U.S. federal
   government only has constitutional jurisdiction to establish holidays
   for itself, for certain federally chartered and regulated businesses
   (such as federal banks), and for Washington, D.C.; otherwise,
   constitutional authority to create public holidays is a power reserved
   to the states. Most states also allow local jurisdictions (cities,
   villages, etc.) to establish their own local holidays. As a result,
   holidays are not governed at the federal level as each state has
   jurisdiction over its holidays. Although holidays are declared as
   official, the government, whether it be federal, state, or local,
   cannot dictate to businesses when they need to officially close.^[2]
   Clifton Mill in Clifton, Ohio is the site of this Christmas display
   with over 3.5 million lights.

   As of 2012^[update], there are eleven federal holidays in the United
   States, ten annual holidays and one quadrennial holiday (Inauguration
   Day).^[3] Pursuant to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968 (effective
   1971), official holidays are observed on a Monday, except for New
   Year's Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, and
   Christmas.^[4]

   All current federal holidays have also been made public holidays in all
   50 states. States are not bound to observe the holidays on the same
   dates as the federal holidays but they are free to do as they will.
   Many states also have additional holidays that are not observed by the
   U.S. federal government, such as Cesar Chavez Day (California,
   Colorado, and Texas), Emancipation Day (District of Columbia, Florida,
   Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Susan B.
   Anthony Day (California, Florida, New York, Wisconsin, and West
   Virginia), and Good Friday (a legal holiday in 12 states). The day
   after Thanksgiving is a public holiday in California.^[5]

   Malls, shopping centers and most retail stores close only on
   Thanksgiving and Christmas and many on Easter Sunday as well, but
   remain open on all other holidays (early closing on Christmas Eve and
   New Year's Eve, and sometimes on other major holidays).^[6] Virtually
   all companies observe and close on the major holidays (New Year's Day,
   Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and
   Christmas). Some non-retail business close on the day after
   Thanksgiving (Black Friday) while some (such as federal banks and post
   offices) are not allowed to close on the day after Thanksgiving. Some
   smaller businesses normally open on Sunday will close on Easter Sunday,
   if it is their experience they will have very few customers that
   day.^[7]

Federal holidays[edit]

   Main article: Federal holidays in the United States

   Federal holidays are designated by Congress in Title V of the United
   States Code (5 U.S.C. § 6103). A federal holiday is a day off for
   federal government employees. State governments generally observe
   federal holidays. Most private companies and certain other businesses,
   such as the United States Postal Service, observe some or all federal
   holidays as well.

   If a holiday falls on a Saturday, the federal government celebrates it
   the preceding Friday; if a holiday falls on a Sunday the federal
   government celebrates it the following Monday. Most, but not all,
   states also observe a Sunday holiday on the following Monday. States
   may observe a Saturday holiday on the preceding Friday, on the
   following Monday, or not at all.

   Private companies and other businesses are not required to follow
   either the federal government or state government holidays. In
   particular, banks that close on Saturdays do not observe a federal
   holiday when it falls on Saturday.
   Date Official Name Remarks
   January 1 (Fixed) New Year's Day^[8] Celebrates beginning of the
   Gregorian calendar year. Festivities include counting down to 12:00
   midnight on the preceding night, New Year's Eve, often with fireworks
   display and party. The ball drop at Times Square in New York City has
   become a national New Year's festivity. Traditional end of Christmas
   and holiday season.^[9]
   Third Monday in January Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. Honors Dr.
   Martin Luther King, Jr., Civil Rights leader, who was actually born on
   January 15, 1929; combined with other holidays in several states. Some
   cities and municipalities hold parades; and more recently, the 1994
   King Holiday and Service Act, which was passed to encourage Americans
   to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer
   service, has gained in popularity (sometimes referred to as a National
   Day of Service).
   Third Monday in February (Presidents' Day) Washington's Birthday
   Washington's Birthday was first declared a federal holiday by an 1879
   act of Congress. The Uniform Holidays Act, 1968, shifted the date of
   the commemoration of Washington's Birthday from February 22 to the
   third Monday in February (between February 15 and 21, meaning the
   observed holiday never falls on Washington's actual birthday). Because
   of this, combined with the fact that President Lincoln's birthday falls
   on February 12, many people now refer to this holiday as "Presidents'
   Day" and consider it a day honoring all American presidents. However,
   neither the Uniform Holidays Act nor any subsequent law changed the
   name of the holiday from Washington's Birthday to Presidents' Day.^[10]
   Last Monday in May Memorial Day Honors the nation's war dead from the
   Civil War onwards; marks the unofficial beginning of the summer season.
   (traditionally May 30, shifted by the Uniform Holidays Act 1968)
   July 4 (Fixed) Independence Day Celebrates the signing of the
   Declaration of Independence from British rule, also called the Fourth
   of July. Fireworks celebration are held in many cities throughout the
   nation.
   First Monday in September Labor Day Celebrates the achievements of
   workers and the labor movement; marks the unofficial end of the summer
   season.
   Second Monday in October Columbus Day Honors Christopher Columbus,
   traditional discoverer of the Americas. In some areas it is also a
   celebration of Italian culture and heritage. (traditionally October 12)
   November 11 (Fixed) Veterans Day Honors all veterans of the United
   States armed forces. It is observed on November 11 to recall the end of
   World War I on that date in 1918 (major hostilities of World War I were
   formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of
   1918 when the Armistice with Germany went into effect).
   Fourth Thursday in November Thanksgiving Day Traditionally celebrates
   the giving of thanks for the autumn harvest. Traditionally includes the
   sharing of a turkey dinner.
   December 25 (Fixed) Christmas The most widely celebrated holiday of the
   Christian year, Christmas is observed as a commemoration of the birth
   of Jesus of Nazareth.

Abolished federal holidays[edit]

Victory Day[edit]

   Main article: Victory Day (United States)
   Crowds celebrating V-J Day in Times Square

   In 1975, the one notable holiday called Victory Day, also called "VJ
   Day" and "Victory over Japan Day" was abolished after being in place
   since 1948. At this time, only one state in the union (Rhode Island)
   still celebrates it.^[11] According to this article and other sources,
   some claim the holiday to be racist and generally encourages hate
   against the Japanese Americans, and possibly other races from Asia.
   Also, the fact that an atomic bomb was used to end the war with Japan
   is seen as cause for its abolition. Today, only the U.S. state of Rhode
   Island still officially observes this holiday with public offices and
   schools being closed.

Proposed federal holidays[edit]

   Many additional federal holidays have been proposed. According to an
   article from CBS, federal holidays are generally "expensive" and they
   only allow federal workers to take the day off. As the U.S. federal
   government is a large employer, the holidays are expensive. If a
   holiday is controversial, opposition will generally cause bills that
   propose such holidays to die. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, for
   example, was one that took much effort to pass. And once it did pass,
   it took more effort for all states to eventually recognize it.^[12]

   The following list is an example of holidays that have been proposed
   and have reasons why they are not observed at the federal level today.
   Some of the holidays are observed at the state level.
   Date Official Name Remarks
   Third Monday of February Susan B. Anthony Day The holiday was proposed
   by Carolyn Maloney in a H. R. 655 on February 11, 2011. Today, the bill
   is dead.^[13]
   Last Monday of March Cesar Chavez Day The holiday was proposed
   California Democrat Joe Baca in H.R. 76 and was further endorsed by
   President Barack Obama^[14]
   Third Monday in May Malcolm X Day The holiday was proposed in H.R. 323
   in 1993 and 1994 by Congressman Charles Rangel.^[15]
   June 14 Flag Day Proposed several times, but only to become a national
   observance when President Harry Truman signed it into law as such.^[16]
   Third Monday of September Native Americans' Day The holiday was
   petitioned for multiple times and was introduced into Congress multiple
   time, but was unsuccessful The proclamation exists today as the "Native
   American Awareness Week."^[17]
   First Tuesday after November 1 Election Day There have been multiple
   movements for this holiday to be official, with the last happening in
   with the "1993 Motor Voter Act", mainly to boost voter turnout.^[18]

Federal observances[edit]

   Main article: Title 36 of the United States Code

   The Congress has designated various United States federal
   observances—days, weeks, months, and other periods for the observance,
   commemoration, or recognition of events, individuals, or other topics.
   These observances do not have the status of holidays in that federal
   employees do not receive any days free from work for observances.

Trading holidays[edit]

          See also New York Stock Exchange

   Trading holidays of the New York Stock Exchange closely resembles those
   designated as federal holidays except for Columbus Day and Veterans
   Day. A total of nine days are designated, which includes Good Friday
   where trading is not done.^[19]

   In addition, partial trading occurs on the day after Thanksgiving, the
   day before Independence Day, and Christmas Eve.

   The official list is as follows:
    Whole days
                  * New Year's Day
                  * Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
                  * Washington's Birthday
                  * Good Friday
                  * Memorial Day
                  * Independence Day
                  * Labor Day
                  * Thanksgiving Day
                  * Christmas Day

   Partial days
                  * Day before Independence Day
                  * Day after Thanksgiving
                  * Christmas Eve

Bank holidays[edit]

   U.S. bank holidays are generally the same as those observed at the
   federal level, but depend on the bank. For example, JP Morgan Chase
   observes all federal holidays except Columbus Day.^[20] U.S. Bank on
   the other hand observes all of the federal holidays.^[21]

Religious and cultural holidays[edit]

   Main articles: Religion in the United States and Separation of church
   and state in the United States
   A Stabat Mater depiction, 1868

   The religious and cultural holidays in the United States is
   characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices.
   However, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides
   that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...." and Article VI
   specifies that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a
   Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."
   As a result, various religious faiths have flourished, as well as
   perished, in the United States. A majority of Americans report that
   religion plays a "very important" role in their lives, a proportion
   unique among developed nations.^[22]

   The majority of Americans (73–80%) identify themselves as Christians
   and about 15–20% have no religious affiliation.^[23] According to the
   American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) (2008) 76% of the
   American adult population identified themselves as Christians, with 51%
   professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered
   Protestant or unaffiliated, and 25% professing Catholic beliefs.^[24]
   The same survey says that other religions (including, for example,
   Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4%
   of the adult population, another 15% of the adult population claim no
   religious affiliation, and 5.2% said they did not know, or they refused
   to reply. According to a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36 percent of
   Americans state that they attend services nearly every week or
   more.^[25]

Christian holidays: Good Friday, Easter, and Christmas[edit]

   Main article: Liturgical year

   In the United States, Christmas is a government holiday while Good
   Friday is not at the federal level. Good Friday is a state holiday in

   U.S. Virgin Islands^[40] and Puerto Rico.^[41]

   While most^[citation needed] stores close on Christmas, some remain
   open. For example, convenience stores such as 7-Eleven and CVS Pharmacy
   remain open.^[42] A reference in A Christmas Story shows a Chinese
   restaurant being the only establishment open on Christmas. Also, many
   Jewish establishments remain open on Christmas, but will close on
   Hannukah instead.^[citation needed]

   Some private businesses and certain other institutions are closed on
   Good Friday.^[43] The financial market and stock market is closed on
   Good Friday.^[44] Most retail stores remain open although some might
   close early. Public schools and most universities are closed on Good
   Friday, either as a holiday of its own, or part of spring break. The
   postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government
   do not close for Good Friday.^[3]

   Easter is recognized as a flag day but has not been a federal holiday
   because it always falls on a Sunday, which is a non-working day for
   federal and state employees. However, many companies, including banks,
   malls, shopping centers and most private retail stores that normally
   open on Sundays are closed on Easter.^[7]

   fruit, toys and so on, especially to children; but gifts of
   age-appropriate Easter baskets for the elderly, the infirm and the

   Diwali

   According to some sources, the Hindu holidays of Diwali and Holi are
   commonly celebrated as a "mainstream" holiday throughout the United
   States, not only by Indian Americans or peoples of Indian descent. Many
   firms that hire a people from India will even go as far as observing
   the holidays with a celebration within the company or even approving it
   as a paid day off.^[49]^[50] Holi, the "festival of colors" has
   inspired a Broadway musical based on this festival.^[51] New York City
   Council has voted on a resolution that may make Diwali and Holi a legal
   holiday in Resolution 1863-2013.^[52] As of August 2013, the resolution
   has passed and the holidays are now officially legal holidays in New

Muslim holidays: Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha[edit]

   Main article: Muslim holidays
   Mehndi is the application of henna as a temporary form of skin
   decoration, commonly applied during Eid al-Fitr.

   According to various sources, the major holidays of Ramadan, Eid
   al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha have been recognized in the United States.
   Awareness of these holidays can be found in calendars published by
   major calendar manufacturers.^[61] ^[62]^[63] According to Al-Jazeera,
   schools in the U.S. states of New York and Michigan (mainly Dearborn)
   may begin to close in observance of all Muslim holidays.^[64]
   Date Name Remarks
   July or August (depends on Muslim calendar) Ramadan Ramadan (Arabic:
   رمضان Ramaḍān, IPA: [rɑmɑˈdˤɑːn];^[variations] Persian: رَمَضان
   Ramazān; Urdu: رَمْضان Ramzān; Turkish: Ramazan) is the ninth month of
   the Islamic calendar;^[65] Muslims worldwide observe this as a month of
   fasting.^[66]^[67] This annual observance is regarded as one of the
   Five Pillars of Islam.^[68] The month lasts 29–30 days based on the
   visual sightings of the crescent moon, according to numerous
   biographical accounts compiled in the hadiths.^[69]^[70] The word
   Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ, which means
   scorching heat or dryness.^[71] Fasting is fard ("obligatory") for
   adult Muslims, except those who are ill, traveling, pregnant,
   breastfeeding, diabetic or going through menstrual bleeding.^[72]
   Fasting the month of Ramadan was made obligatory (wājib) during the
   month of Sha'aban, in the second year after the Muslims migrated from
   Mecca to Medina.
   July or August (depends on Muslim calendar) Eid al-Fitr Eid al-Fitr
   (Arabic: عيد الفطر ʻĪd al-Fiṭr, IPA: [ʕiːd al fitˤr], "festival of
   breaking of the fast"), also called Feast of Breaking the Fast, the
   Sugar Feast, Bayram (Bajram), the Sweet Festival^[73] and the Lesser
   Eid, is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide
   that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting
   (sawm). The religious Eid is a single day and Muslims are not permitted
   to fast on that day. The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or
   30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan.
   The day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month of
   Shawwal. This is a day when Muslims around the world show a common goal
   of unity. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based
   on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the
   exact day of celebration varies by locality. However, in most
   countries, it is generally celebrated on the same day as Saudi
   Arabia.^[74]
   September or October (depends on Muslim calendar) Eid al-Adha Eid
   al-Adha (Arabic: عيد الأضحى ʿīd al-aḍḥā [ʕiːd ælˈʔɑdˤħæ] meaning
   "Festival of the sacrifice"), also called the Feast of the Sacrifice,
   the Major Festival,^[75] the Greater Eid, Kurban Bayram (Turkish:
   Kurban Bayramı; Bosnian: kurban-bajram), Eid e Qurban (Persian: عید
   قربان) or Bakr'Eid (Urdu: بکرا عید), is the second of two religious
   holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide each year. It honors the
   willingness of Abraham (Ibrahim) to sacrifice his young first-born son
   Ishmael (Ismail)^a as an act of submission to God's command, before God
   then intervened to provide Abraham with a lamb to sacrifice
   instead.^[76] In the lunar-based Islamic calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on
   the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days.^[77] In the
   international Gregorian calendar, the dates vary from year to year,
   drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year.

Other religious, traditional, and informal holidays celebrated in the United
States[edit]

   In addition to the federal/national holidays, many religious, ethnic,
   and other traditional holidays populate the calendar, as well as
   observances proclaimed by officials and lighter celebrations. These are
   rarely observed by businesses as holidays (Except for Easter and most
   often also on Good Friday);^[7] indeed, many are viewed as
   opportunities for commercial promotion. Because of this
   commercialization, some critics apply the deprecatory term Hallmark
   holiday to such days, after the Hallmark greeting card company.
   Date Name Remarks
   January or February Lunar New Year First day of the year in the lunar
   calendar, traditionally used by many East Asian communities.
   February 2 Groundhog Day The day on which folklore states that the
   behavior of a groundhog emerging from its burrow is said to predict the
   onset of Spring in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.
   March 8 International Women's Day A day set aside to honor women and
   their accomplishments in history.
   April 1 April Fools' Day A day that people commonly play tricks or
   jokes on family, friends, and co-workers, especially in
   English-speaking nations. Sometimes called "the Feast of All Fools" as
   a play on the feast days of saints; there is no evidence the holiday
   has any Christian religious origins.
   April 22 (varies by location and observance) Earth Day A celebration of
   environmentalism.
   Last Friday in April Arbor Day A day for planting trees.
   May 1 May Day In most other countries, May 1 is International Workers'
   Day, the equivalent of Labor Day, and some Americans do observe May 1
   in that context. But before it was a labor-related holiday, May Day was
   a Celtic and English holiday that celebrated the transition from Spring
   to Summer, and it is that holiday that those Americans and Canadians
   who still celebrate May Day call to mind.
   May 5 Cinco de Mayo Primarily a celebration of Mexican culture by
   Mexican-Americans living in the United States. Although this is the
   anniversary of the victory of the Mexican Army over the French at the
   Battle of Puebla in 1862, Cinco de Mayo is far more important in the
   USA than in Mexico itself, often celebrated even by
   non-Mexican-Americans. Additionally, this "holiday" is often mistaken
   by Americans as being Mexican Independence Day, which is actually
   observed on September 16.
   Second Sunday in May Mother's Day Honors mothers and motherhood (made a
   "federal holiday" by Presidential order, although most federal agencies
   are already closed on Sundays)
   First Sunday in June Children's Day Proclaimed by President George W.
   Bush in 2001 to honor children.^[78]
   June 14 Flag Day Commemorates the adoption of the flag of the United
   States, in 1777.
   June 27 Helen Keller Day Commemorates the achievements of Helen Keller
   and the blind.
   Third Sunday in June Father's Day Honors fathers and fatherhood.
   August 26 Women's Equality Day Celebrates the fight for, and progress
   towards, equality for women. Established by the United States Congress
   in 1971 to commemorate two anniversaries: Passage of the Nineteenth
   Amendment to the United States Constitution ensuring Woman Suffrage in
   1920 and a nation-wide demonstration for equal rights, the Women's
   Strike for Equality, in 1970.
   First Sunday after Labor Day Grandparent's Day Similar to
   Mother's/Father's Day but honoring grandparents and grandparenthood.
   September 11 Patriot Day Commemorates the attacks on the World Trade
   Center (New York City), The Pentagon (Washington, D.C.), and United
   Airlines Flight 93 in 2001.
   September 17 Constitution/Citizenship Day Commemorates the adoption of
   the Constitution of the United States.
   October 6 German-American Day Commemorates the date in 1683 when 13
   German families from Krefeld near the Rhine landed in Philadelphia.
   These families subsequently founded in Germantown, Pennsylvania, the
   first German settlement in the original thirteen American colonies.
   October 9 Leif Erikson Day Honors Leif Erikson, the Norse Viking
   explorer, who led the first Europeans to discover and set foot in the
   New World.
   First Tuesday after the first Monday in November Election Day Observed
   by the federal and state governments in applicable years; legal holiday
   in some states.
   Day After Thanksgiving Black Friday Traditionally the beginning of the
   Christmas shopping season in the United States. "Black Friday" is not a
   holiday under that name, but California and some other states observe
   "The Day After Thanksgiving" as a holiday for state government
   employees. Virtually all schools, colleges, and universities are also
   closed, along with many non-retail private sector businesses. Federal
   government offices, post offices and federally chartered banks must
   open on Black Friday (unless the President issues an executive order or
   proclamation allowing them to close). It is called "Black Friday"
   because it begins the sales period when most American retailers make
   their profits for the year. Contrary to popular belief, Black Friday is
   not the busiest sales day of the year (that honor belongs to Christmas
   Eve, December 24). Rather, it is the barometer by which retailers are
   able to gauge December sales and whether they will indeed end the year
   "in the black" (instead of "in the red"). A busy Black Friday almost
   invariably indicates a busy shopping season, while poor sales on Black
   Friday usually herald a very slow season.
   December 7 Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day Day to mourn the attack on
   Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941.
   December 26 through January 1 Kwanzaa African American holiday
   celebration created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Ron Karenga
   December 31 New Year's Eve Final Day of the Gregorian year. Usually
   accompanied by much celebration, such as party and fireworks. Virtually
   every company and retail outlet closes early, except for stores that
   sell alcoholic beverages and party supplies.
