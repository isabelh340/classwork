   The term third party is used in the United States for any and all
   political parties in the United States other than one of the two major
   parties (Republican Party and Democratic Party). The term can also
   refer to independent politicians not affiliated with any party at all
   and to write-in candidates.

Notable elections[edit]

   Main article: List of third party performances in United States
   elections

   A number of third party, independent, and write-in candidates have
   performed well in many U.S. elections. Greens, Libertarians and others
   have elected state Legislators and local officials. The Socialists had
   600 mayors at one time before World War I, including Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin; New Haven, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania; and
   Schenectady, New York. There have been 20th Century governors elected
   as independents, and from such parties as Progressive, Reform,
   Farmer-Labor, Populist, and Prohibition. There were others in the
   century before. However, the United States has had a two-party system
   for over a century. The winner take all system for presidential
   elections and the single-seat plurality voting system for Congressional
   elections have over time created the two-party system (see Duverger's
   law).

   Third party candidates very rarely win any elections. For example, such
   a candidate only won a U.S. Senate election twice (0.6%) since 1990.
   Therefore, it is very rare to have a national officeholder not
   affiliated with and endorsed by one of the two major parties.
   Currently, there are only two U.S. Senators (Angus King and Bernie
   Sanders), who are neither Democrat nor Republican, while no U.S.
   Representative hails from outside the major parties. Although third
   party candidates rarely actually win elections, they can have an effect
   on them. If they do well, they are often accused of having a spoiler
   effect. Sometimes they have won votes in the electoral college, as in
   the 1832 Presidential election. They can draw attention to issues that
   may be ignored by the majority parties. If such an issue finds
   acceptance with the voters, one or more of the major parties may adopt
   the issue into its own party platform. Also, a third party may be used
   by the voter to cast a protest vote as a form of referendum on an
   important issue. Third parties may also help voter turnout by bringing
   more people to the polls. Third party candidates at the top of the
   ticket can help to draw attention to other party candidates down the
   ballot, helping them to win local or state office. In 2004 the U.S.
   electorate consisted of an estimated 43% registered Democrats and 33%
   registered Republicans, with independents and those belonging to other
   parties constituting 25%.^[2]

   The only three U.S. Presidents without a major party affiliation were
   George Washington, John Tyler, and Andrew Johnson, and only Washington
   served his entire tenure as an independent. Neither of the other two
   were ever elected president in their own right, both being vice
   presidents who ascended to office upon the death of a president, and
   both became independents because they were unpopular with their
   parties. John Tyler was elected on the Whig ticket in 1840 with William
   Henry Harrison but was expelled by his own party. Andrew Johnson was
   elected with Abraham Lincoln on the National Union ticket in 1864,
   after serving as Democratic Senator and Governor in Tennessee, but
   effectively governed as an independent as the new party floundered into
   oblivion.

   Lincoln Chafee was the most recent serving governor not from one of the
   two major parties. Chafee was elected Governor of Rhode Island as
   independent in 2010, before changing his affiliation to the Democratic
   Party in May 2013.^[3]

Barriers to third party success[edit]

   Libertarian Presidential Election Results.png

Winner-take-all vs. proportional representation[edit]

   In winner-take-all (or plurality-take-all), the candidate with the
   largest number of votes wins, even if the margin of victory is
   extremely narrow or the proportion of votes received is not a majority.
   Unlike in proportional representation, runners-up do not gain
   representation in a first-past-the-post system. In the United States,
   systems of proportional representation are uncommon, especially above
   the local level, and are entirely absent at the national level. In
   Presidential elections, the majority requirement of the Electoral
   College, and the Constitutional provision for the House of
   Representatives to decide the election if no candidate receives a
   majority, serves as a further disincentive to third party candidacies.

   In the United States, if an interest group is at odds with its
   traditional party, it has the option of running sympathetic candidates
   in primaries. If the candidate fails in the primary and believes he has
   a chance to win in the general election he may form or join a third
   party. Because of the difficulties third parties face in gaining any
   representation, third parties tend to exist to promote a specific issue
   or personality. Often, the intent is to force national public attention
   on such an issue. Then one or both of the major parties may rise to
   commit for or against the matter at hand, or at least weigh in. H. Ross
   Perot eventually founded a third party, the Reform Party, to support
   his 1996 campaign. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt made a spirited run for
   the presidency on the Progressive Party ticket, but he never made any
   efforts to help Progressive congressional candidates in 1914, and in
   the 1916 election, he supported the Republicans.

Ballot access laws[edit]

   Nationally, ballot access laws are the major challenge to third party
   candidacies. While the Democratic and Republican parties usually easily
   obtain ballot access in all fifty states in every election, third
   parties often fail to meet criteria for ballot access, such as
   registration fees. Or, in many states, they do not meet petition
   requirements in which a certain number of voters must sign a petition
   for a third party or independent candidate to gain ballot access.^[4]
   In recent presidential elections, Ross Perot appeared on all 50 state
   ballots as an independent in 1992 and the candidate of the Reform Party
   in 1996. (Perot, a multimillionaire, was able to provide significant
   funds for his campaigns.) Patrick Buchanan appeared on all 50 state
   ballots in the 2000 election,^[5] largely on the basis of Perot's
   performance as the Reform Party's candidate four years prior. The
   Libertarian Party has appeared on the ballot in at least 46 states in
   every election since 1980, except for 1984 when David Bergland gained
   access in only 36 states. In 1980, 1992, 1996 the party made the ballot
   in all 50 states and D.C. The Green Party gained access to 44 state
   ballots in 2000 but only 27 in 2004. The Constitution Party appeared on
   42 state ballots in 2004.^[6] Ralph Nader, running as an independent in
   2004, appeared on 34 state ballots. In 2008, Nader appeared on 45
   ballots and D.C. For more information see ballot access laws.

Debate rules[edit]

   Presidential debates between the nominees of the two major parties
   first occurred in 1960, then after three cycles without debates, took
   place again in 1976 and have happened in every election since. Third
   party or independent candidates have been included in these debates in
   only two cycles. Ronald Reagan and John Anderson debated in 1980, but
   incumbent President Carter refused to appear with Anderson, and
   Anderson was excluded from the subsequent debate between Reagan and
   Carter.

   Debates in other state and federal elections often exclude Independent
   and third party candidates, and the Supreme Court has upheld such
   tactics in several cases. The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)
   is a private company. ^[7] Independent Ross Perot was included in all
   three of the debates with Republican George H. W. Bush and Democrat
   Bill Clinton in 1992, largely at the behest of the Bush
   campaign.^[citation needed] His participation helped Perot climb from
   7% before the debates to 19% on Election Day.^[8]

   Perot was excluded from the 1996 debates despite his strong showing
   four years prior.^[9] In 2000 revised debate access rules made it even
   harder for third party candidates to gain access by stipulating that,
   besides being on enough state ballots to win an Electoral College
   majority, debate participants must clear 15% in pre-debate opinion
   polls. This rule remained in place for 2004,^[10]^[11] when as many as
   62 million people watched the debates,^[12] and is still in effect for
   2008.^[13]^[14] The 15% criterion, had it been in place, would have
   prevented Anderson and Perot from participating in the debates they
   appeared in.

Major party marginalization[edit]

   A third party candidate will sometimes strike a chord with a section of
   voters in a particular election, bringing an issue to national
   prominence and amount a significant proportion of the popular vote.
   Major parties often respond to this by adopting this issue in a
   subsequent election. After 1968, under President Nixon the Republican
   Party adopted a "Southern Strategy" to win the support of conservative
   Democrats opposed to the Civil Rights Movement and resulting
   legislation and to combat third parties with southern agendas. This can
   be seen as a response to the popularity of segregationist candidate
   George Wallace who gained 13.5% of the popular vote in the 1968
   election for the American Independent Party.

   In 1996, both the Democrats and the Republicans agreed to deficit
   reduction on the back of Ross Perot's popularity in the 1992 election.
   This severely undermined Perot’s campaign in the 1996 election.

Third party officeholders[edit]

   Main article: Third party officeholders in the United States

   Third party officeholders in the U.S. are rare. Since the end of
   Reconstruction, there have been a total of 31 U.S. Senators, 111
   Representatives, and 22 Governors who were not affiliated with a major
   party.

       on the whole, the process—and the cumulative burden it places on

       a stable two-party system will not justify unreasonably

       hurdles third parties face in the American political arena today.”
