   The Supreme Court of the United States (first abbreviated as SCOTUS in
   1879)^[1] was established pursuant to Article III of the United States
   Constitution in 1789 as the highest federal court in the United States.
   It has ultimate (and largely discretionary) appellate jurisdiction over
   all federal courts and over state court cases involving issues of
   federal law, plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. In
   the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is the final
   interpreter of federal constitutional law, although it may only act
   within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction.

   The Court consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight
   associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by
   the Senate. Once appointed, justices have life tenure unless they
   resign, retire, take senior status, or are removed after impeachment
   (though no justice has ever been removed). In modern discourse, the
   justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or
   liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. Each
   justice has one vote, and while many cases are decided unanimously,
   many of the highest profile cases often expose ideological beliefs that
   track with those philosophical or political categories. The Court meets
   in the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C.

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the Supreme Court of the United States

   The ratification of the United States Constitution established the
   Supreme Court in 1789. Its powers are detailed in Article Three of the
   Constitution. The Supreme Court is the only court specifically
   established by the Constitution, and all the others were created by
   Congress. Congress is also responsible for conferring the title
   "justice" upon the associate justices, who have been known to scold
   lawyers for instead using the term "judge", which is the term used by
   the Constitution.^[2]

   The Court first convened on February 2, 1790,^[3] by which time five of
   its six initial positions had been filled. The sixth member (James
   Iredell) joined on May 12, 1790. Because the full Court had only six
   members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by
   two-thirds (voting four to two).^[4] However, Congress has always
   allowed less than the Court's full membership to make decisions,
   starting with a quorum of four judges in 1789.^[5]

Earliest beginnings to Marshall[edit]

   Main article: Marshall Court

   Under Chief Justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789–1801), the
   Court heard few cases; its first decision was West v. Barnes (1791), a
   case involving a procedural issue.^[6] The Court lacked a home of its
   own and had little prestige,^[7] a situation not helped by the
   highest-profile case of the era, Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which was
   reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh
   Amendment.^[8]
   Chief Justice Marshall

   The Court's power and prestige waxed during the Marshall Court
   (1801–1835).^[9] Under Marshall, the Court established the principle of
   judicial review, including specifying itself as the supreme expositor
   of the Constitution (Marbury v. Madison)^[10]^[11] and made several
   important constitutional rulings giving shape and substance to the
   balance of power between the federal government and the states
   (prominently, Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, McCulloch v. Maryland and
   Gibbons v. Ogden).^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]

   The Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his
   opinion seriatim,^[16] a remnant of British tradition,^[17] and instead
   issuing a single majority opinion.^[16] Also during Marshall's tenure,
   although beyond the Court's control, the impeachment and acquittal of
   Justice Samuel Chase in 1804–1805 helped cement the principle of
   judicial independence.^[18]^[19]

From Taney to Taft[edit]

   The Taney Court (1836–1864) made several important rulings, such as
   Sheldon v. Sill, which held that while Congress may not limit the
   subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of
   the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing
   with certain subjects.^[20] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered
   for its ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford,^[21] which may have helped
   precipitate the Civil War.^[22] In the Reconstruction era, the Chase,
   Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War
   amendments to the Constitution^[15] and developed the doctrine of
   substantive due process (Lochner v. New York;^[23] Adair v. United
   States).^[24]

   Under the White and Taft Courts (1910–1930), the Court held that the
   Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of
   Rights against the states (Gitlow v. New York),^[25] grappled with the
   new antitrust statutes (Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United
   States), upheld the constitutionality of military conscription
   (Selective Draft Law Cases)^[26] and brought the substantive due
   process doctrine to its first apogee (Adkins v. Children's
   Hospital).^[27]

The New Deal era[edit]

   During the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson Courts (1930–1953), the Court
   gained its own accommodation in 1935^[28] and changed its
   interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the
   powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin
   Roosevelt's New Deal (most prominently West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,
   Wickard v. Filburn, United States v. Darby and United States v.
   Butler).^[29]^[30]^[31] During World War II, the Court continued to
   favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese citizens
   (Korematsu v. United States) and the mandatory pledge of allegiance
   (Minersville School District v. Gobitis). Nevertheless, Gobitis was
   soon repudiated (West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette),
   and the Steel Seizure Case restricted the pro-government trend.

Warren and Burger[edit]

   Main article: Warren Court

   The Warren Court (1953–1969) dramatically expanded the force of
   Constitutional civil liberties.^[32] It held that segregation in public
   schools violates equal protection (Brown v. Board of Education, Bolling
   v. Sharpe and Green v. County School Bd.)^[33] and that traditional
   legislative district boundaries violated the right to vote (Reynolds v.
   Sims). It created a general right to privacy (Griswold v.
   Connecticut),^[34] limited the role of religion in public school (most
   prominently Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v.
   Schempp),^[35]^[36] incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights
   against the States—prominently Mapp v. Ohio (the exclusionary rule) and
   Gideon v. Wainwright (right to appointed counsel),^[37]^[38]—and
   required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by
   police (Miranda v. Arizona);^[39] At the same time, however, the Court
   limited defamation suits by public figures (New York Times v. Sullivan)
   and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust
   victories.^[40]

   The Burger Court (1969–1986) expanded Griswold's right to privacy to
   strike down abortion laws (Roe v. Wade),^[41] but divided deeply on
   affirmative action (Regents of the University of California v.
   Bakke)^[42] and campaign finance regulation (Buckley v. Valeo),^[43]
   and dithered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications
   were defective (Furman v. Georgia),^[44] then that the death penalty
   itself was not unconstitutional (Gregg v. Georgia).^[44]^[45]^[46]

Rehnquist and Roberts[edit]

   Main article: Roberts Court

   The Rehnquist Court (1986–2005) was noted for its revival of judicial
   enforcement of federalism,^[47] emphasizing the limits of the
   Constitution's affirmative grants of power (United States v. Lopez) and
   the force of its restrictions on those powers (Seminole Tribe v.
   Florida, City of Boerne v. Flores).^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52] It struck
   down single-sex state schools as a violation of equal protection
   (United States v. Virginia), laws against sodomy as violations of
   substantive due process (Lawrence v. Texas),^[53] and the line item
   veto (Clinton v. New York), but upheld school vouchers (Zelman v.
   Simmons-Harris) and reaffirmed Roe's restrictions on abortion laws
   (Planned Parenthood v. Casey).^[54] The Court's decision in Bush v.
   Gore, which ended the electoral recount during the presidential
   election of 2000, was controversial.^[55]^[56]

   The Roberts Court (2005–present) is regarded by some as more
   conservative than the Rehnquist Court.^[57]^[58] Some of its major
   rulings have concerned federal preemption (Wyeth v. Levine), civil
   procedure (Twombly-Iqbal), abortion (Gonzales v. Carhart),^[59] climate
   change (Massachusetts v. EPA), and the Bill of Rights, prominently
   Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (First Amendment),^[60]
   Heller-McDonald (Second Amendment),^[61] and Baze v. Rees (Eighth
   Amendment).^[62]^[63]

Composition[edit]

Size of the Court[edit]

   Article III of the United States Constitution leaves it to Congress to
   fix the number of justices. The Judiciary Act of 1789 called for the
   appointment of six justices, and as the nation's boundaries grew,
   Congress added justices to correspond with the growing number of
   judicial circuits: seven in 1807, nine in 1837, and ten in 1863.

   In 1866, at the behest of Chief Justice Chase, Congress passed an act
   providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced,
   which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition.
   Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. In
   1869, however, the Circuit Judges Act returned the number of justices
   to nine,^[64] where it has since remained.

   President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937.
   His proposal envisioned appointment of one additional justice for each
   incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused
   retirement, up to a maximum bench of 15 justices. The proposal was
   ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges, but the
   actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to pack the Court
   with justices who would support Roosevelt's New Deal.^[65] The plan,
   usually called the "Court-packing Plan", failed in Congress.^[66]
   Nevertheless, the Court's balance began to shift within months when
   Justice van Devanter retired and was replaced by Senator Hugo Black. By
   the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated
   Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice.^[67]

Appointment and confirmation[edit]

   Main article: Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the
   United States
   The Roberts Court, October 2010
   Back row (left to right): Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen G. Breyer, Samuel A.
   Alito, and Elena Kagan. Front row (left to right): Clarence Thomas,
   Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, and Ruth
   Bader Ginsburg

   The President of the United States appoints justices "by and with the
   advice and consent of the Senate."^[68] Most presidents nominate
   candidates who broadly share their ideological views, although a
   justice's decisions may end up being contrary to a president's
   expectations. Because the Constitution sets no qualifications for
   service as a justice, a president may nominate anyone to serve, subject
   to Senate confirmation.

   In modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable
   attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to
   confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record
   aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts
   hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full
   Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's
   practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The
   first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in
   1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and
   the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II
   in 1955.^[69] Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full
   Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has
   explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert
   Bork in 1987.

   Nevertheless, not every nominee has received a floor vote in the
   Senate. Although Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote
   in committee to block a nomination, a nominee may be filibustered once
   debate has begun in the full Senate. No nomination for associate
   justice has ever been filibustered, but President Lyndon Johnson's
   nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl
   Warren as Chief Justice was successfully filibustered in 1968. A
   president may also withdraw a nominee's name before the actual
   confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate
   will reject them, most recently Harriet Miers in 2006.

   Once the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and
   sign a commission, to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must
   be affixed, before the new justice can take office.^[70] The seniority
   of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the
   confirmation or swearing-in date.^[71]

   Before 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From
   the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically
   approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the
   present, however, the process has taken much longer. Some believe this
   is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than
   in the past.^[72]

Recess appointments[edit]

   When the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary
   appointments to fill vacancies. Recess appointees hold office only
   until the end of the next Senate session (at most, less than two
   years). The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue
   serving; of the two chief justices and six associate justices who have
   received recess appointments, only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not
   subsequently confirmed.

   No president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has made a recess appointment
   to the Court, and the practice has become rare and controversial even
   in lower federal courts.^[73] In 1960, after Eisenhower had made three
   such appointments, the Senate passed a "sense of the Senate" resolution
   that recess appointments to the Court should only be made in "unusual
   circumstances."^[74] Such resolutions are not legally binding but are
   an expression of Congress's views in the hope of guiding executive
   action.^[74]^[75]

Tenure[edit]

   The Constitution provides that justices "shall hold their offices
   during good behavior" (unless appointed during a Senate recess). The
   term "good behavior" is understood to mean justices may serve for the
   remainder of their lives, unless they are impeached and convicted by
   Congress, resign or retire.^[76] Only one justice has been impeached by
   the House of Representatives (Samuel Chase, March 1804), but he was
   acquitted in the Senate (March 1805).^[77] Moves to impeach sitting
   justices have occurred more recently (for example, William O. Douglas
   was the subject of hearings twice, in 1953 and again in 1970; and Abe
   Fortas resigned while hearings were being organized), but they did not
   reach a vote in the House. No mechanism exists for removing a justice
   who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, but unable (or
   unwilling) to resign.^[78]

   Because justices have indefinite tenure, timing of vacancies can be
   unpredictable. Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession, as in the
   early 1970s when Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr. and William Rehnquist were
   nominated to replace Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II, who
   retired within a week of each other. Sometimes a great length of time
   passes between nominations, such as the eleven years between Stephen
   Breyer's nomination in 1994 to succeed Harry Blackmun and the
   nomination of John Roberts in 2005 to fill the seat of Sandra Day
   O'Connor (though Roberts' nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for
   the role of Chief Justice after Rehnquist died).

   Despite the variability, all but four Presidents have been able to
   appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after
   taking office, though his successor (John Tyler) made an appointment
   during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died early in
   his term, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme
   Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who
   became President after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied
   the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the
   Court. Jimmy Carter is the only President to complete at least one term
   in office without making a nomination to the Court during his
   presidency.

   Three presidents have appointed justices who collectively served more
   than 100 years: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Abraham
   Lincoln.^[79]

Court demographics[edit]

   Main article: Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States

   The Court currently has six male and three female justices. One justice
   is African American, one is Latino, and two are Italian-Americans; six
   justices are Roman Catholics, and three are Jewish. The average age is
   68 years, 9 months, and every current justice has an Ivy League
   background.^[80] Four justices are from the state of New York, two from
   New Jersey, two from California, and one from Georgia.

   In the 19th century, every justice was a male of European descent,
   almost always Protestant and of Northern European descent, and concerns
   about diversity focused on geography, to represent all regions of the
   country, rather than ethnic, religious, or gender diversity.^[81]
   Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Justice in 1967,
   and Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female Justice in 1981.
   O'Connor, whose appointment fulfilled Ronald Reagan's campaign promise
   to place a woman on the Court, was later joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
   appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993. Marshall was succeeded by Clarence
   Thomas in 1991, who is the second African American to serve on the
   Supreme Court. In 1986, Antonin Scalia became the first
   Italian-American to serve on the Court. After O'Connor had in 2006 been
   succeeded by Samuel Alito, Ginsburg was in 2009 joined by Sonia
   Sotomayor, the first Latino justice, and in 2010 by Elena Kagan, so
   that there were three female justices.

   Most justices have been Protestants, including 35 Episcopalians, 19
   Presbyterians, 10 Unitarians, five Methodists, and three
   Baptists.^[82]^[83] The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836,
   and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice, Louis
   Brandeis. In recent years this situation has reversed: after the
   retirement of Justice Stevens in June 2010, the Court is without a
   Protestant for the first time in its history.^[84]

Retired justices[edit]

   There are currently three living retired justices of the Supreme Court
   of the United States: John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, and David
   Souter. As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of
   the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to
   sit on lower federal courts, usually the United States Courts of
   Appeals. Such assignments are formally made by the Chief Justice, on
   request of the Chief Judge of the lower court and with the consent of
   the retired Justice. In recent years, Justice O'Connor has sat with
   several Courts of Appeals around the country, and Justice Souter has
   frequently sat on the First Circuit, the court of which he was briefly
   a member before joining the Supreme Court.

   The status of a retired Justice is analogous to that of a Circuit or
   District Judge who has taken senior status, and eligibility of a
   Supreme Court Justice to assume retired status (rather than simply
   resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service
   criteria.

   Justices sometimes strategically plan their decisions to leave the
   bench, with personal, institutional, and partisan factors playing a
   role.^[85]^[86] The fear of mental decline and death often motivates
   justices to step down. The desire to maximize the Court's strength and
   legitimacy through one retirement at a time, when the Court is in
   recess, and during non-presidential election years suggests a concern
   for institutional health. Finally, especially in recent decades, many
   justices have timed their departure to coincide with a compatible
   president holding office to ensure that a like-minded successor would
   be appointed.^[87]^[88]

Seniority and seating[edit]

   Many of the internal operations of the Court are organized by the
   seniority of the justices; the Chief Justice is considered the most
   senior member of the Court, regardless of the length of his or her
   service. The Associate Justices are then ranked by the length of their
   service.
   The interior of the United States Supreme Court
   The interior of the Unites States Supreme Court

   During Court sessions, the justices sit according to seniority, with
   the Chief Justice in the center, and the Associate Justices on
   alternating sides, with the most senior Associate Justice on the Chief
   Justice's immediate right, and the most junior Associate Justice seated
   on the left farthest away from the Chief Justice. Therefore, the
   current court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective
   of those facing the Court: Sotomayor, Breyer, Thomas, Scalia (most
   senior Associate Justice), Roberts (Chief Justice), Kennedy, Ginsburg,
   Alito, and Kagan (most junior Associate Justice). In the official
   yearly Court photograph, justices are arranged similarly, with the five
   most senior members sitting in the front row in the same order as they
   would sit during Court sessions (Thomas, Scalia, Roberts, Kennedy,
   Ginsburg), and the four most junior justices standing behind them,
   again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions
   (Sotomayor, Breyer, Alito, Kagan).

   In the justices' private conferences, the current practice is for them
   to speak and vote in order of seniority from the Chief Justice first to
   the most junior Associate Justice last. The most junior Associate
   Justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the
   justices may require as they convene alone, such as answering the door
   of their conference room, serving coffee, and transmitting the orders
   of the Court to the court's clerk.^[89] Justice Joseph Story served the
   longest as the junior justice, from February 3, 1812, to September 1,
   1823, for a total of 4,228 days. Justice Stephen Breyer follows close
   behind, with 4,199 days when Samuel Alito joined the court on January
   31, 2006.^[90]

Salary[edit]

   Main article: Federal judge salaries in the United States

   For the years 2009 through 2012, associate justices were paid $213,900
   and the chief justice $223,500.^[91] Article III, Section 1 of the U.S.
   Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent
   justices. Once a justice meets age and service requirements, the
   justice may retire. Judicial pensions are based on the normal formula
   for federal employees, but a justice's pension will never be less than
   their salary at time of retirement. (The same procedure applies to
   judges of other federal courts.)

Judicial leanings[edit]

   See also: Ideological leanings of U.S. Supreme Court justices

   While justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from
   political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and
   executive branches, jurists are informally categorized in legal and
   political circles as being judicial conservatives, moderates, or
   liberals. Such leanings, however, generally refer to legal outlook
   rather than a political or legislative one.

   As of the October 2012 term, the Court consists of five justices
   appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic
   presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and
   justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito (appointed by Republican presidents)
   comprise the Court's conservative wing. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer,
   Sotomayor, and Kagan (appointed by Democratic presidents) comprise the
   Court's liberal wing. Justice Kennedy (appointed by President Reagan)
   is generally considered "a conservative who has occasionally voted with
   liberals",^[92] and is often the swing vote that determines the outcome
   of close cases.^[93]^[94]^[95]

   Tom Goldstein argued in an article in SCOTUSblog in 2010, that the
   popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological
   lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is "in significant
   part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions."^[96] He
   points out that in the 2009 term, almost half the cases were decided
   unanimously, and only about 20% were decided by a 5-to-4 vote. Barely
   one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal/conservative divide (fewer
   if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included). He also
   pointed to several cases that defy the popular conception of the
   ideological lines of the Court.^[97] Goldstein further argued that the
   large number of pro-criminal-defendant summary dismissals (usually
   cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly
   misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument)
   are an illustration that the conservative justices have not been
   aggressively ideological. Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique
   that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of
   Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be
   disrespectful of precedent, also lacks merit: Thomas has most often
   called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he
   views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia
   and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.

   According to statistics compiled by SCOTUSblog, in the twelve terms
   from 2000 to 2011, an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues
   (22%) were decided by a 5–4 vote, with an average of 70% of those split
   opinions decided by a Court divided along the traditionally perceived
   ideological lines (about 15% of all opinions issued). Over that period,
   the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62% of the time
   that the Court has divided along ideological lines, which represents
   about 44% of all the 5–4 decisions.^[98]

   In the October 2010 term, the Court decided 86 cases, including 75
   signed opinions and 5 summary reversals (where the Court reverses a
   lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the
   case).^[99]^[100] Four were decided with unsigned opinions, two cases
   affirmed by an equally divided Court, and two cases were dismissed as
   improvidently granted. Justice Kagan recused herself from 26 of the
   cases due to her prior role as United States Solicitor General. Of the
   80 cases, 38 (about 48%, the highest percentage since the October 2005
   term) were decided unanimously (9–0 or 8–0), and 16 decisions were made
   by a 5–4 vote (about 20%, compared to 18% in the October 2009 term, and
   29% in the October 2008 term).^[101] However, in fourteen of the
   sixteen 5–4 decisions, the Court divided along the traditional
   ideological lines (with Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan on the
   liberal side, and Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on the
   conservative, and Kennedy providing the "swing vote"). This represents
   87% of those 16 cases, the highest rate in the past 10 years. The
   conservative bloc, joined by Kennedy, formed the majority in 63% of the
   5–4 decisions, the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the Roberts
   court.^[99]^[102]^[103]^[104]^[105]

   In the October 2011 term, the Court decided 75 cases. Of these, 33
   (about 44%) were decided unanimously, and 15 (about 20%, the same
   percentage as in the previous term) were decided by a vote of 5–4. Of
   the latter 15, the Court divided along the perceived ideological lines
   10 times, with Justice Kennedy siding with the conservative justices
   (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito) five times, and with the liberal
   justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) five
   times.^[98]^[106]^[107]

   In the October 2012 term, the Court decided 78 cases. Five of them were
   decided in unsigned opinions. 38 out of the 78 decisions (representing
   49% of the decisions) were unanimous in judgement, with 24 decisions
   being completely unanimous (a single opinion with every justice that
   participated joined). This was the largest percentage of unanimous
   decisions that the Court had in ten years, since the October 2002 term
   (when 51% of the decisions handed down were unanimous). The Court split
   5-4 in 23 cases (29% of the total); of these, 16 broke down along the
   traditionally perceived ideological lines, with Chief Justice Roberts
   and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on one side, Justices Ginsburg,
   Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan on the other, and Justice Kennedy holding
   the balance. Of these 16 cases, Justice Kennedy sided with the
   conservatives on 10 cases, and with the liberals on 6. Three cases were
   decided by an interesting alignment of justices, with Chief Justice
   Roberts joined by Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer and Alito in the
   majority, with Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the
   minority. The greatest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg
   and Kagan, who agreed on 72 of the 75 cases in which both voted; the
   lowest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Alito, who
   agreed only on 45 out of 77 cases in which they both participated.
   Justice Kennedy was in the majority of 5-4 decisions on 20 out of the
   24 cases, and in 71 of the 78 cases of the term, in line with his
   position as the "swing-vote" of the Court.^[108]^[109]

Facilities[edit]

   The present U.S. Supreme Court building seen from across 1st Street NE.
   From the 1860s until the 1930s, the court sat in the Old Senate Chamber
   of the U.S. Capitol.
   Main article: United States Supreme Court Building

   The Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants'
   Exchange Building in New York City. When Philadelphia became the
   capital, the Court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in
   Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to
   Washington, D.C., the Court occupied various spaces in the United
   States Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own
   purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by Cass
   Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings
   of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble. The
   building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law
   library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a
   gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the
   Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own police force separate
   from the Capitol Police.^[110]

   Located across the street from the United States Capitol at One First
   Street NE and Maryland Avenue,^[111]^[112] the building is open to the
   public from 9 am to 4:30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and
   holidays.^[111] Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom
   unaccompanied. There is a cafeteria, a gift shop, exhibits, and a
   half-hour informational film.^[110] When the Court is not in session,
   lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm
   and reservations are not necessary.^[110] When the Court is in session
   the public may attend oral arguments, which are held twice each morning
   (and sometimes afternoons) on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in
   two-week intervals from October through late April, with breaks during
   December and February. Visitors are seated on a first-come first-served
   basis. One estimate is there are about 250 seats available.^[113] The
   number of open seats varies from case to case; for important cases,
   some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night. From
   mid-May until the end of June, the court releases orders and opinions
   beginning at 10 am, and these 15 to 30-minute sessions are open to the
   public on a similar basis.^[110] Supreme Court Police are available to
   answer questions.^[111]

Jurisdiction[edit]

   Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from Marbury v.
   Madison, in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of
   judicial review.
   Main article: Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States

   Section 2 of Article Three of the United States Constitution outlines
   the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States:

     The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity,
     arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and
     Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all
     Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to
     all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies
     to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies
     between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another
     State; between Citizens of different States; between Citizens of the
     same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and
     between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States,
     Citizens or Subjects.

   The jurisdiction of the federal courts was further limited by the
   Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbade
   federal courts from hearing cases "commenced or prosecuted against [a
   State] by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any
   Foreign State." However, states may waive this immunity, and Congress
   may abrogate the states' immunity in certain circumstances (see
   Sovereign immunity). In addition to constitutional constraints,
   Congress is authorized by Article III to regulate the court's appellate
   jurisdiction. The federal courts may hear cases only if one or more of
   the following conditions are met:
    1. If there is diversity of citizenship (meaning, the parties are
       citizens of different states or countries, including foreign
       states),^[114] and the amount of damages exceeds $75,000.^[115]
    2. If the case presents a federal question, meaning that it involves a
       claim or issue "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties
       of the United States", assuming that the question is not
       constitutionally committed to another branch of government.^[116]
    3. If the United States federal government (including the Post
       Office)^[117] is a party in the case.^[118]^[119]

   Exercise of this power can become controversial (see jurisdiction
   stripping). For example, 28 U.S.C. § 2241(e)(1), as amended by the
   Detainee Treatment Act, provides that "No court, justice, or judge
   shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ
   of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the
   United States who has been determined by the United States to have been
   properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such
   determination."

   The Constitution specifies that the Supreme Court may exercise original
   jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors and other diplomats, and in
   cases in which a state is a party. In all other cases, however, the
   Court has only appellate jurisdiction. It considers cases based on its
   original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the
   Supreme Court on appeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction
   cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states.

   The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts,
   rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of
   1789 and upheld early in the Court's history, by its rulings in Martin
   v. Hunter's Lessee (1816) and Cohens v. Virginia (1821). The Supreme
   Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct
   appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices
   that permit so-called "collateral review" of state cases.

   Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that
   federal courts may only entertain "cases" or "controversies", the
   Supreme Court avoids deciding cases that are moot and does not render
   advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For
   example, in DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), the Court
   dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school
   affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated
   since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the Court on his claim
   would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered. The mootness
   exception is not absolute. If an issue is "capable of repetition yet
   evading review", the Court will address it even though the party before
   the Court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result. In Roe
   v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and other abortion cases, the Court
   addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking
   abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer
   than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the
   lower courts to the Supreme Court.

Justices as Circuit Justices[edit]

   The United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals,
   each of which is assigned a "Circuit Justice" from the Supreme Court.
   Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the
   history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time.

   Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each Justice was required to "ride
   circuit", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases
   alongside local judges. This practice encountered opposition from many
   Justices, who cited the difficulty of travel. Moreover, several
   individuals opposed it because a Justice could not be expected to be
   impartial in an appeal if he had previously decided the same case while
   riding circuit. Circuit riding was abolished in 1891.

   Today, the Circuit Justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing
   with certain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may
   be addressed by a single Justice. These include applications for
   emergency stays (including stays of execution in death-penalty cases)
   and injunctions pursuant to the All Writs Act arising from cases within
   that circuit, as well as routine requests such as requests for
   extensions of time. In the past, Circuit Justices also sometimes ruled
   on motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of habeas corpus, and
   applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal.
   Ordinarily, a Justice will resolve such an application by simply
   endorsing it "Granted" or "Denied" or entering a standard form of
   order. However, the Justice may elect to write an opinion—referred to
   as an in-chambers opinion—in such matters if he or she wishes.

   A Circuit Justice may sit as a judge on the Court of Appeals of that
   circuit, but over the past hundred years, this has rarely occurred. A
   Circuit Justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over
   the Chief Judge of the circuit.

   The Chief Justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of
   Columbia Circuit, the Fourth Circuit (which includes Maryland and
   Virginia, the states surrounding the District of Columbia), and since
   it was established, the Federal Circuit. Each Associate Justice is
   assigned to one or two judicial circuits.

   As of September 28, 2010, the allotment of the justices among the
   circuits is:^[120]
             Circuit                   Justice
   District of Columbia Circuit Chief Justice Roberts
   First Circuit                Justice Breyer
   Second Circuit               Justice Ginsburg
   Third Circuit                Justice Alito
   Fourth Circuit               Chief Justice Roberts
   Fifth Circuit                Justice Scalia
   Sixth Circuit                Justice Kagan
   Seventh Circuit              Justice Kagan
   Eighth Circuit               Justice Alito
   Ninth Circuit                Justice Kennedy
   Tenth Circuit                Justice Sotomayor
   Eleventh Circuit             Justice Thomas
   Federal Circuit              Chief Justice Roberts

   Four of the current Justices are assigned to circuits on which they
   previously sat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C. Circuit),
   Justice Breyer (First Circuit), Justice Alito (Third Circuit), and
   Justice Kennedy (Ninth Circuit).

Process[edit]

   Main article: Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States

   A term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each
   October, and continues until June or early July of the following year.
   Each term consists of alternating periods of approximately two weeks
   known as "sittings" and "recesses." Justices hear cases and deliver
   rulings during sittings; they discuss cases and write opinions during
   recesses.

Case selection[edit]

   Nearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of
   certiorari, commonly referred to as "cert". The Court may review any
   case in the federal courts of appeals "by writ of certiorari granted
   upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case".^[121]
   The Court may only review "final judgments rendered by the highest
   court of a state in which a decision could be had" if those judgments
   involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law.^[122]
   The party that appealed to the Court is the petitioner and the
   non-mover is the respondent. All case names before the Court are styled
   petitioner v. respondent, regardless of which party initiated the
   lawsuit in the trial court. For example, criminal prosecutions are
   brought in the name of the state and against an individual, as in State
   of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda. If the defendant is convicted, and his
   conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court, when
   he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes Miranda v. Arizona.

   There are situations where the Court has original jurisdiction, such as
   when two states have a dispute against each other, or when there is a
   dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a
   case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases
   include United States v. Texas, a case to determine whether a parcel of
   land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and Virginia v.
   Tennessee, a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary
   between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the
   setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval.
   Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v.
   Brailsford,^[123] parties in an action at law in which the Supreme
   Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine
   issues of fact.^[124] Two other original jurisdiction cases involve
   colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in New Jersey v.
   Delaware, and water rights between riparian states upstream of
   navigable waters in Kansas v. Colorado.

   The common shorthand name for cases is typically the first party (the
   petitioner). For example, Brown v. Board of Education is referred to
   simply as Brown, and Roe v. Wade as Roe. The exception to this rule is
   when the name of a state, or the United States, or some government
   entity, is the first listed party. In that instance, the name of the
   second party is the shorthand name. For example, Iowa v. Tovar is
   referred to simply as Tovar, and Gonzales v. Raich is referred to
   simply as Raich, because the first party, Alberto Gonzales, was sued in
   his official capacity as the United States Attorney General.

   A cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a
   conference. A conference is a private meeting of the nine Justices by
   themselves; the public and the Justices' clerks are excluded. If four
   Justices vote to grant the petition, the case proceeds to the briefing
   stage; otherwise, the case ends. Except in death penalty cases and
   other cases in which the Court orders briefing from the respondent, the
   respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the cert
   petition.

   The court grants a petition for cert only for "compelling reasons",
   spelled out in the court's Rule 10. Such reasons include:
     * Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a
       provision of the federal Constitution
     * Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual
       course of judicial proceedings
     * Resolving an important question of federal law, or to expressly
       review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a
       previous decision of the Court.

   When a conflict of interpretations arises from differing
   interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by
   different federal circuit courts of appeals, lawyers call this
   situation a "circuit split". If the court votes to deny a cert
   petition, as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come
   before it, it does so typically without comment. A denial of a cert
   petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case, and the decision of
   the lower court stands as the final ruling in the case.

   To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the Court each
   year (of the more than 7,000 petitions the Court receives each year, it
   will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer),
   the Court employs an internal case management tool known as the "cert
   pool." Currently, all justices except for Justice Alito participate in
   the cert pool.^[125]^[126]^[127]

Oral argument[edit]

   When the Court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral
   argument. Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as
   distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying
   the cert petition. With the consent of the parties or approval of the
   Court, amici curiae, or "friends of the court", may also file briefs.
   The Court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October
   through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument
   (the Court may choose to give more time, though this is rare),^[128]
   and during that time, the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask
   questions. The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve
   some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has
   concluded. Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one
   party if that party agrees. The Court advises counsel to assume that
   the Justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a
   case.

The Supreme Court bar[edit]

   In order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted
   to the court's bar. Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year.
   The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members. In reality, pleading is
   limited to several hundred attorneys. The rest join for a one-time fee
   of $200, earning the court about $750,000 annually. Attorneys can be
   admitted as either individuals or as groups. The group admission is
   held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the
   Chief Justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys.^[129] The
   lawyers mostly apply for the trophy of a certificate for their office,
   an addition for their resume, and access to better seating if they wish
   to attend an oral argument.^[130] Members of the Supreme Court Bar are
   also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court
   Library.^[131]

Decision[edit]

   At the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision.
   Cases are decided by majority vote of the Justices. It is the Court's
   practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular Term by
   the end of that Term. Within that Term, however, the Court is under no
   obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral
   argument. At the conclusion of oral argument, the Justices retire to
   another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied, and the
   most senior Justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the
   Court's opinion to a Justice on his or her side. Drafts of the Court's
   opinion, as well as any concurring or dissenting opinions,^[132]
   circulate among the Justices until the Court is prepared to announce
   the judgment in a particular case.

   It is possible that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides
   evenly on a case. If that occurs, then the decision of the court below
   is affirmed, but does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it
   results in a return to the status quo ante. For a case to be heard,
   there must be a quorum of at least six justices.^[133] If a quorum is
   not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices
   believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term,
   then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had
   been evenly divided. For cases brought directly to the Supreme Court by
   direct appeal from a United States District Court, the Chief Justice
   may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals
   for a final decision there.^[134] This has only occurred once in U.S.
   history, in the case of United States v. Alcoa.^[135]

Published opinions[edit]

   The Court's opinions are published in three stages. First, a slip
   opinion is made available on the Court's web site and through other
   outlets. Next, several opinions are bound together in paperback form,
   called a preliminary print of United States Reports, the official
   series of books in which the final version of the Court's opinions
   appears. About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final
   bound volume of U.S. Reports is issued. The individual volumes of U.S.
   Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports—or a
   competing version published by another commercial legal publisher—to
   allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases
   quickly and easily.

   As of March 2012^[ref]^[dead link], there are 566 volumes of U.S.
   Reports. Lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form
   vvv U.S. ppp (yyyy). The number before the "U.S." refers to the volume
   number, and the number after the U.S. refers to the page within that
   volume. The number in parentheses is the year in which the case was
   decided. For instance, the citation for Roe v. Wade is 410 U.S. 113
   (1973) and it means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page
   113 of volume 410 of U.S. Reports. For hot-from-the-press judgments,
   the volume and page numbers are replaced with "___". As of March
   2012^[update], the U.S. Reports have published a total of 30,161
   Supreme Court opinions, covering the decisions handed down from
   February 1790 to March 2012. This figure does not reflect the number of
   cases the Court has taken up, as several cases can be addressed by a
   single opinion (see, for example, Parents v. Seattle, where Meredith v.
   Jefferson County Board of Education was also decided in the same
   opinion; by a similar logic, Miranda v. Arizona actually decided not
   only Miranda but also three other cases: Vignera v. New York, Westover
   v. United States, and California v. Stewart). A more unusual example is
   The Telephone Cases, which comprise a single set of interlinked
   opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the U.S. Reports.

   Opinions are also collected and published in two unofficial, parallel
   reporters: Supreme Court Reporter, published by West (now a part of
   Thomson Reuters), and United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers'
   Edition (simply known as Lawyers' Edition), published by LexisNexis. In
   court documents, legal periodicals, and other legal media, case
   citations generally contain the cites from each of the three reporters;
   for example, the citation to Citizens United v. Federal Election
   Commission is presented as Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n,
   585 U.S. 50, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), with "S. Ct."
   representing the Supreme Court Reporter, and "L. Ed." representing the
   Lawyers' Edition.^[136]^[137]

Institutional powers and constraints[edit]

   The Federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the
   Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting
   and ratification of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, in
   fact, is nowhere mentioned in it, Over the ensuing years, the question
   of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the
   drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of
   evidence bearing on the question either way.^[138] Nevertheless, the
   power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines
   are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent. Many
   of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in
   Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: "A Constitution is, in
   fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It
   therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the
   meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If
   there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two,
   that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course,
   to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be
   preferred to the statute."

   The Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws
   unconstitutional in Marbury v. Madison (1803), consummating the
   American system of checks and balances. In explaining the power of
   judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority
   to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts, part of
   the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. His
   contention was not that the Court had privileged insight into
   constitutional requirements, but that it was the constitutional duty of
   the judiciary, as well as the other branches of government, to read and
   obey the dictates of the Constitution.^[139]

   Since the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between
   the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of
   egalitarianism, self-government, self-determination and freedom of
   conscience. At one pole are those who view the Federal Judiciary and
   especially the Supreme Court as being "the most separated and least
   checked of all branches of government."^[140] Indeed federal judges and
   justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by
   virtue of their tenure "during good behavior", and their pay may "not
   be diminished" while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article
   Three). Though subject to the process of impeachment, only one Justice
   has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed
   from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the
   least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations
   of the other branches of government.^[139] The Supreme Court, it is
   noted, cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on
   respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its
   judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when
   the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester
   v. Georgia. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia
   courts, is supposed to have remarked, "John Marshall has made his
   decision; now let him enforce it!";^[141] however, this alleged
   quotation has been disputed. Some state governments in the South also
   resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment
   Brown v. Board of Education. More recently, many feared that President
   Nixon would refuse to comply with the Court's order in United States v.
   Nixon (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes. Nixon, however,
   ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.

   Supreme Court decisions can, and have been purposefully overturned by
   constitutional amendment, which has happened on five occasions:
     * Chisholm v. Georgia – overturned by the Eleventh Amendment (1795)
     * Dred Scott v. Sandford – overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment
       (1865) and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868)
     * Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. – overturned by the Sixteenth
       Amendment (1913)
     * Minor v. Happersett – overturned by the Nineteenth Amendment (1920)
     * Oregon v. Mitchell – overturned by the Twenty-sixth Amendment
       (1971)

   When the Court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws
   rather than of the Constitution, simple legislative action can reverse
   the decisions (for example, in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter
   act, superseding the limitations given in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &
   Rubber Co. in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune from
   political and institutional restraints: lower federal courts and state
   courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement
   officials.^[142]

   In addition, the other two branches can restrain the Court through
   other mechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving
   the President power to influence future decisions by appointments (as
   in Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan discussed above). Congress can pass
   legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and
   other federal courts over certain topics and cases: this is suggested
   by language in Section 2 of Article Three, where the appellate
   jurisdiction is granted "with such Exceptions, and under such
   Regulations as the Congress shall make." The Court sanctioned such
   congressional action in the Reconstruction case ex parte McCardle
   (1869), though it rejected Congress' power to dictate how particular
   cases must be decided in United States v. Klein (1871).

   On the other hand, through its power of judicial review, the Supreme
   Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation
   between the legislative and executive branches of the federal
   government; for example, in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export
   Corp. (1936), Dames & Moore v. Regan (1981), and notably in Goldwater
   v. Carter (1979), (where it effectively gave the Presidency the power
   to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress or the
   Senate). The Court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope
   of Executive authority, as in Humphrey's Executor v. United States
   (1935), the Steel Seizure Case (1952), and United States v. Nixon
   (1974).

Law clerks[edit]

   See also: Law clerk and List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the
   United States

   Each Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions
   for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and
   draft opinions. Associate justices are allowed four clerks. The chief
   justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only
   three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only
   four.^[143] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.

   The first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice Horace Gray in
   1882.^[143]^[144] Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Louis Brandeis were
   the first Supreme Court justices to use recent law school graduates as
   clerks, rather than hiring a "stenographer-secretary".^[145] Most law
   clerks are recent law school graduates.

   The first female clerk was Lucile Lomen, hired in 1944 by Justice
   William O. Douglas.^[143] The first African-American, William T.
   Coleman, Jr., was hired in 1948 by Justice Felix Frankfurter.^[143] A
   disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees
   from elite law schools, especially Harvard, Yale, the University of
   Chicago, Columbia, and Stanford. From 1882 to 1940, 62% of law clerks
   were graduates of Harvard Law School.^[143] Those chosen to be Supreme
   Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school
   class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the
   moot court board. In recent times,^[when?] clerking previously for a
   judge in a federal circuit court has been a prerequisite to clerking
   for a Supreme Court justice.

   Six Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices: Byron
   White clerked for Frederick M. Vinson, John Paul Stevens clerked for
   Wiley Rutledge, Stephen Breyer clerked for Arthur Goldberg, William H.
   Rehnquist clerked for Robert H. Jackson, John G. Roberts, Jr. clerked
   for William H. Rehnquist, and Elena Kagan clerked for Thurgood
   Marshall. Many of the justices have also clerked in the federal Courts
   of Appeals. Justice Samuel Alito clerked for Judge Leonard I. Garth of
   the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Elena
   Kagan clerked for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Politicization of the Court[edit]

   Clerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often
   given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft. "Supreme Court
   clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into
   the 1980s", according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of
   Vanderbilt University Law School.^[146]^[147] "As law has moved closer
   to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably
   become proxies for the different political agendas that have been
   pressed in and through the courts", former federal court of appeals
   judge J. Michael Luttig said.^[146] David J. Garrow, professor of
   history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the Court had thus
   begun to mirror the political branches of government. "We are getting a
   composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House
   of Representatives", Professor Garrow said. "Each side is putting
   forward only ideological purists."^[146]

   According to the Vanderbilt Law Review study, this politicized hiring
   trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is "a
   superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a
   legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of
   law."^[146]

   A poll conducted in June 2012 by The New York Times and CBS News showed
   that just 44 percent of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court
   is doing. Three-quarters said the justices' decisions are sometimes
   influenced by their political or personal views.^[148]

Criticism[edit]

   Some criticisms leveled at the Supreme Court are:
     * Judicial activism: The Supreme Court has been criticized for not
       keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial
       activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising
       judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to
       any particular ideology.^[149] An often cited example of
       conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v.
       New York, which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers,
       including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice
       John Roberts.^[149]^[150] An often cited example of liberal
       judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion
       in part on the basis of the "right to privacy" expressed in the
       Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was
       circuitous.^[149] Legal scholars,^[151]^[152] justices,^[153] and
       presidential candidates^[154] have criticized the Roe decision. The
       progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been
       criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan^[155] and
       former presidential contender Barry Goldwater.^[156] More recently
       Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for
       changing the long standing view that the first amendment did not
       apply to the corporation.^[157] Lincoln warned, referring to the
       Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became "irrevocably
       fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have
       ceased to be their own rulers."^[158] Former justice Thurgood
       Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: "You do what
       you think is right and let the law catch up."^[159] During
       different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different
       directions.^[160]^[161] Critics from both sides complain that
       activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own
       views instead.^[162]^[163]^[164] Critics include writers such as
       Andrew Napolitano,^[165] Phyllis Schlafly,^[166] Mark R.
       Levin,^[167] Mark I. Sutherland,^[168] and James MacGregor
       Burns.^[169]^[170] Past presidents from both parties have attacked
       judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon,
       and Ronald Reagan.^[171]^[172] Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert
       Bork wrote: "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état, –
       slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless."^[173]
       Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about
       judicial activism, "their definition of an activist judge is one
       who votes differently than they would like."^[174] One law
       professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in
       some respects "certainly a legislative body."^[175]
     * Federal versus state power: There has been debate throughout
       American history about the boundary between federal and state
       power. While Framers such as James Madison^[176] and Alexander
       Hamilton^[177] argued in the Federalist Papers that their
       then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state
       governments,^[178]^[179]^[180]^[181] others argue that expansive
       federal power is good and consistent with the Framers'
       wishes.^[182] The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
       explicitly grants "powers not delegated to the United States by the
       Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to
       the States respectively, or to the people." The Supreme Court has
       been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to
       interfere with state authority. One criticism is that it has
       allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by
       upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with
       interstate commerce, but that were enacted under the guise of
       regulating interstate commerce; and by voiding state legislation
       for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce. For example,
       the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
       to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic
       species of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the
       insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state
       lines; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in
       2005.^[183] Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress's power
       over interstate commerce was "complete in itself, may be exercised
       to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than
       are prescribed in the Constitution."^[184] Justice Alito said
       congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is "quite
       broad."^[185] Modern day theorist Robert B. Reich suggests debate
       over the Commerce Clause continues today.^[184] Advocates of
       states' rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have
       also criticized the Court, saying it has misused the Fourteenth
       Amendment to undermine state authority. Justice Brandeis, in
       arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal
       interference, suggested that states should be "laboratories" of
       democracy.^[186] One critic wrote "the great majority of Supreme
       Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state, not federal,
       law."^[187] However, others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a
       positive force that extends "protection of those rights and
       guarantees to the state level."^[188]
     * Judicial interference in political disputes: Some Court decisions
       have been criticized for injecting the Court into the political
       arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two
       branches of government. The Bush v. Gore decision, in which the
       Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and
       effectively chose George W. Bush over Al Gore, has been criticized
       extensively, particularly by
       liberals.^[189]^[190]^[191]^[192]^[193]^[194] Another example are
       Court decisions on apportionment and re-districting: in Baker v.
       Carr, the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions;
       Justice Frankfurter in a "scathing dissent" argued against the
       court wading into so-called political questions.^[195]
     * Failing to protect individual rights: Court decisions have been
       criticized for failing to protect individual rights: the Dred Scott
       (1857) decision upheld slavery;^[196] Plessy v Ferguson (1896)
       upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal;^[197]
       Kelo v. City of New London (2005) was criticized by prominent
       politicians, including New Jersey governor Jon Corzine, as
       undermining property rights.^[198]^[199] A student criticized a
       1988 ruling that allowed school officials "to block publication of
       a student article in the high school newspaper."^[200] Some critics
       suggest the 2009 bench with a conservative majority has "become
       increasingly hostile to voters" by siding with Indiana's voter
       identification laws which tend to "disenfranchise large numbers of
       people without driver's licenses, especially poor and minority
       voters", according to one report.^[201] Senator Al Franken
       criticized the Court for "eroding individual rights."^[174]
       However, others argue that the Court is too protective of some
       individual rights, particularly those of people accused of crimes
       or in detention. For example, Chief Justice Warren Burger was an
       outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule, and Justice Scalia
       criticized the Court's decision in Boumediene v. Bush for being too
       protective of the rights of Guantanamo detainees, on the grounds
       that habeas corpus was "limited" to sovereign territory.^[202]
     * Supreme Court has too much power: This criticism is related to
       complaints about judicial activism. George Will wrote that the
       Court has an "increasingly central role in American
       governance."^[203] It was criticized for intervening in bankruptcy
       proceedings regarding ailing carmaker Chrysler Corporation in
       2009.^[204] A reporter wrote that "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
       intervention in the Chrysler bankruptcy" left open the "possibility
       of further judicial review" but argued overall that the
       intervention was a proper use of Supreme Court power to check the
       executive branch.^[204] Warren E. Burger, before becoming Chief
       Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such "unreviewable
       power" it is likely to "self-indulge itself" and unlikely to
       "engage in dispassionate analysis".^[205] Larry Sabato wrote
       "excessive authority has accrued to the federal courts, especially
       the Supreme Court."^[206]
     * Courts are poor check on executive power: British constitutional
       scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having
       courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the
       Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the
       courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to wend their way
       through the system, their ability to restrain the other two
       branches is severely weakened.^[207]^[208]
     * Not choosing enough cases to review: Senator Arlen Specter said the
       Court should "decide more cases".^[174] On the other hand, although
       Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of
       cases that the Court hears now is smaller today than when he first
       joined the Supreme Court, he also stated that he has not changed
       his standards for deciding whether to review a case, nor does he
       believe his colleagues have changed their standards. He attributed
       the high volume of cases in the late 1980s, at least in part, to an
       earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way
       through the courts.^[209]
     * Secretive proceedings: The Court has been criticized for keeping
       its deliberations hidden from public view.^[210] Its inner workings
       are difficult for reporters to cover, like a closed "cartel", only
       revealing itself through "public events and printed releases, with
       nothing about its inner workings", according to a review of Jeffrey
       Toobin's expose The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme
       Court.^[193] The reviewer writes: "few (reporters) dig deeply into
       court affairs. It all works very neatly; the only ones hurt are the
       American people, who know little about nine individuals with
       enormous power over their lives."^[193] Larry Sabato complains
       about the Court's "insularity."^[206] A Fairleigh Dickinson
       University poll conducted in 2010 found that 61% of American voters
       agreed that televising Court hearings would "be good for
       democracy", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court
       proceedings if they were televised.^[211]^[212] In recent years,
       many justices have appeared on television, written books, and made
       public statements to journalists.^[209]^[213] In a 2009 interview
       on C-SPAN, journalists Joan Biskupic (of USA Today) and Lyle
       Denniston (of SCOTUSblog) argued that the Court is a "very open"
       institution, with only the justices' private conferences being
       inaccessible to others.^[209] In October 2010, the Court began the
       practice of posting on its website recordings and transcripts of
       oral arguments on the Friday after they take place.
     * Lifetime tenure: Critic Larry Sabato wrote: "The insularity of
       lifetime tenure, combined with the appointments of relatively young
       attorneys who give long service on the bench, produces senior
       judges representing the views of past generations better than views
       of the current day."^[206] Sanford Levinson has been critical of
       justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based
       on longevity.^[214] James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure
       has "produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court
       institutionally almost always behind the times."^[169] Proposals to
       solve these problems include term limits for justices, as proposed
       by Levinson^[215] and Sabato^[206]^[216] as well as a mandatory
       retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein.^[217] However, others
       suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits, such as
       impartiality and freedom from political pressure. Alexander
       Hamilton in Federalist 78 wrote "nothing can contribute so much to
       its firmness and independence as permanency in office."^[218]
