   Mining in the United States has been active since colonial times, but
   became a major industry in the 1800s with a number of new mineral
   discoveries causing a series of mining "rushes."

Mining accidents[edit]

   From 1880 to 1910, mine accidents claimed thousands of fatalities.
   Where annual mining deaths had numbered more than 1,000 a year during
   the early part of the 20th century, they decreased to an average of
   about 500 during the late 1950s, and to 93 during the 1990s.^[1] In
   addition to deaths, many thousands more are injured (an average of
   21,351 injuries per year between 1991 and 1999), but overall there has
   been a downward trend of deaths and injuries.

   The Monongah Mining Disaster was the worst mining accident of American
   history; 362 workers were killed in an underground explosion on
   December 6, 1907 in Monongah, West Virginia. The U.S. Bureau of Mines
   was created in 1910 to investigate accidents, advise industry, conduct
   production and safety research, and teach courses in accident
   prevention, first aid, and mine rescue. The Federal Coal Mine Health
   and Safety Acts of 1969 and 1977 set further safety standards for the
   industry.

   In 1959, the Knox Mine Disaster occurred in Port Griffith,
   Pennsylvania. The swelling Susquehanna river collapsed into a mine
   under it and resulted in 12 deaths. In Plymouth, Pennsylvania, the
   Avondale Mine Disaster resulted in the deaths of 108 miners and two
   rescue workers after a fire in the only shaft eliminated the oxygen in
   the mine. Federal laws for mining safety ensued this disaster.
   Pennsylvania suffered another disaster in 2002 at Quecreek, 9 miners
   were trapped underground and subsequently rescued after 78 hours.
   During 2006, 72 miners lost their lives at work, 47 by coal mining. The
   majority of these fatalities occurred in Kentucky and West Virginia,
   including the Sago Mine Disaster.^[2]^[3] On April 5, 2010, in the
   Upper Big Branch Mine disaster an underground explosion caused the
   deaths of 29 miners.
