   Political system of the United States

   The United States is a federal constitutional republic, in which the
   President of the United States (the head of state and head of
   government), Congress, and judiciary share powers reserved to the
   national government, and the federal government shares sovereignty with
   the state governments.

   The executive branch is headed by the President and is independent of
   the legislature. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of
   Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judicial
   branch (or judiciary), composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal
   courts, exercises judicial power (or judiciary). The judiciary's
   function is to interpret the United States Constitution and federal
   laws and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the
   executive and legislative branches. The federal government's layout is
   explained in the Constitution. Two political parties, the Democratic
   Party and the Republican Party, have dominated American politics since
   the American Civil War, although there are also smaller parties like
   the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, and the Constitution Party.

   There are major differences between the political system of the United
   States and that of most other developed democracies. These include
   greater power in the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of
   power held by the Supreme Court, the separation of powers between the
   legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main
   parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United
   States than in other developed country democracies.

   The federal entity created by the U.S. Constitution is the dominant
   feature of the American governmental system. However, most people are
   also subject to a state government, and all are subject to various
   units of local government. The latter include counties, municipalities,
   and special districts.

   This multiplicity of jurisdictions reflects the country's history. The
   federal government was created by the states, which as colonies were
   established separately and governed themselves independently of the
   others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to
   efficiently carry out various state functions. As the country expanded,
   it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.

Political culture[edit]

   Scholars from Alexis de Tocqueville to the present have found a strong
   continuity in core American political values since the American
   revolution.^[1]

Colonial origins[edit]

   Main article: Colonial history of the United States

   The colonies were exceptional in the European world for their vibrant
   political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious
   young men into politics.^[2] First, suffrage was the most widespread in
   the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property
   allowed to vote. While fewer than 1% of British men could vote, a
   majority of white American men were eligible. While the roots of
   democracy were apparent, nevertheless deference was typically shown to
   social elites in colonial elections.^[3] That deference declined
   sharply with the American Revolution. Second, in each colony a wide
   range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies,
   especially the assemblies and county governments.^[4] Topics of public
   concern and debate included land grants, commercial subsidies, and
   taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and
   schools. Americans spent a great deal of time in court, as private
   lawsuits were very common. Legal affairs were overseen by local judges
   and juries, with a central role for trained lawyers. This promoted the
   rapid expansion of the legal profession, and dominant role of lawyers
   in politics was apparent by the 1770s, as attested by the careers of
   John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, among many others.^[5] Thirdly, the
   American colonies were exceptional in world context because of the
   growth of representation of different interest groups. Unlike Europe,
   where the royal court, aristocratic families and the established church
   were in control, the American political culture was open to merchants,
   landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers,
   Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable
   groups. Over 90% of the representatives elected to the legislature
   lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have an
   absentee member of Parliament. Finally, and most dramatically, the
   Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political
   values of Republicanism, which stressed equal rights, the need for
   virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and
   aristocracy.^[6] None of the colonies had political parties of the sort
   that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for
   power.

American ideology[edit]

   Republicanism, along with a form of classical liberalism remains the
   dominant ideology.^[7] Central documents include the Declaration of
   Independence (1776), Constitution (1787), Federalist Papers (1788),
   Bill of Rights (1791), and Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (1863),
   among others. Even the secessionists who formed the Confederacy in 1861
   believed in the same values.^[8] Among the core tenets of this ideology
   are the following:^[9]
     * Civic duty: citizens have the responsibility to understand and
       support the government, participate in elections, pay taxes, and
       perform military service.
     * Opposition to Political corruption.
     * Democracy: The government is answerable to citizens, who may change
       the representatives through elections.
     * Equality before the law: The laws should attach no special
       privilege to any citizen. Government officials are subject to the
       law just as others are.
     * Freedom of religion: The government can neither support nor
       suppress religion.
     * Freedom of speech: The government cannot restrict through law or
       action the personal, non-violent speech of a citizen; a marketplace
       of ideas.

   At the time of the United States' founding, the economy was
   predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses, and
   state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative.
   Laissez-faire ideology was largely abandoned during the Great
   Depression. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was
   characterized by the Keynesian consensus, a time during which modern
   American liberalism dominated economic policy virtually unchallenged.
   Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, laissez-faire ideology,
   as explained especially by Milton Friedman, has once more become a
   powerful force in American politics.^[10] While the American welfare
   state expanded more than threefold after WWII, it has been at 20% of
   GDP since the late 1970s.^[11]^[12] Today, modern American liberalism,
   and modern American conservatism are engaged in a continuous political
   battle, characterized by what the Economist describes as "greater
   divisiveness [and] close, but bitterly fought elections."^[13]

Usage of "left–right" politics[edit]

   Main article: Usage of "left–right" politics in the United States

   The modern American political spectrum and the usage of "left–right
   politics", liberalism, and conservatism in the United States differs
   from the rest of the world. According to American historian Arthur
   Schlesinger, Jr. (writing in 1956), "Liberalism in the American usage
   has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any
   European country, save possibly Britain," citing the fact that American
   liberalism does not support classical liberalism's commitment to
   limited government and laissez-faire economics.^[14] Because those two
   positions are instead generally supported by American conservatives,
   historian Leo P. Ribuffo noted in 2011, "what Americans now call
   conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism."^[15]

Suffrage[edit]

   Main article: Voting rights in the United States

   Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older.
   All states and the District of Columbia contribute to the electoral
   vote for President. However, the District, and other U.S. holdings like
   Puerto Rico and Guam, lack federal representation in Congress. These
   constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure
   outside their respective areas. Each commonwealth, territory, or
   district can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of
   Representatives.

   Women's suffrage became an important issue after the American Civil
   War. After the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
   was ratified in 1870, giving African American men the right to vote,
   various women's groups wanted the right to vote as well. Two major
   interest groups were then formed. The first group was the National
   Woman Suffrage Association, formed by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
   Cady Stanton, that wanted to work for suffrage on the federal level and
   to push for more governmental changes, such as the granting of property
   rights to married women.^[16] The second group was the American Woman
   Suffrage Association, formed by Lucy Stone, whose goal was to give
   women the right to vote.^[17] In 1890, the two groups merged to form
   the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). The NAWSA
   then mobilized to obtain support state-by-state, and by 1920, the
   Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified,
   giving women the right to vote.^[18] Student activism against the
   Vietnam War in the 1960s prompted the passage of the Twenty-sixth
   Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting
   age from 21 to 18, and prohibited age discrimination at the voting
   booth.

State government[edit]

   See also: State governments of the United States

   States governments have the power to make laws for all citizens that
   are not granted to the federal government or denied to the states in
   the U.S. Constitution.These include education, family law, contract
   law, and most crimes. Unlike the federal government, which only has
   those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has
   inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the
   state or national constitution.

   Like the federal government, state governments have three branches:
   executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is
   its popularly elected governor, who typically holds office for a
   four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except
   for Nebraska, which has unicameral legislature, all states have a
   bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the Senate
   and the lower house called the House of Representatives, the House of
   Delegates, Assembly or something similar. In most states, senators
   serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year
   terms.

   The constitutions of the various states differ in some details but
   generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution,
   including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for
   organizing the government. However, state constitutions are generally
   more detailed.

Local government[edit]

   See also: Urban politics in the United States

   There are 89,500 local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492
   municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000
   other special districts that deal with issues like fire
   protection.^[19] Local governments directly serve the needs of the
   people, providing everything from police and fire protection to
   sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation,
   and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan—local activists
   suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.^[20]

   About 28% of the people live in cities of 100,000 or more population.
   City governments are chartered by states, and their charters detail the
   objectives and powers of the municipal government. For most big cities,
   cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to
   meeting the needs of their residents. Types of city governments vary
   widely across the nation. However, almost all have a central council,
   elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various
   department heads, to manage the city's affairs. Cities in the West and
   South usually have nonpartisan local politics.

   There are three general types of city government: the mayor-council,
   the commission, and the council-manager. These are the pure forms; many
   cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.

Mayor-Council[edit]

   This is the oldest form of city government in the United States and,
   until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all
   American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national
   governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and
   an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming
   the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments
   and other officials, sometimes with the approval of the council. He or
   she has the power of veto over ordinances (the laws of the city) and
   often is responsible for preparing the city's budget. The council
   passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions
   money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council
   seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.

The Commission[edit]

   This combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group
   of officials, usually three or more in number, elected city-wide. Each
   commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments.
   Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is
   operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the
   mayor, although his or her power is equivalent to that of the other
   commissioners.^[21]

Council-Manager[edit]

   The city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban
   problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected
   public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive
   powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a
   highly trained and experienced professional city manager.

   The city manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities.
   Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and
   sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city
   manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city
   budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set
   term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with his
   or her work.

County government[edit]

   The county is a subdivision of the state, sometimes (but not always)
   containing two or more townships and several villages. New York City is
   so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs, each a county
   in its own right. On the other hand, Arlington County, Virginia, the
   United States' smallest county, located just across the Potomac River
   from Washington, D.C., is both an urbanized and suburban area, governed
   by a unitary county administration. In other cities, both the city and
   county governments have merged, creating a consolidated city–county
   government.

   In most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the county
   seat, and this is where the government offices are located and where
   the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties,
   boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors
   represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for
   state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the
   salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and
   maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and
   county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and
   legislative power may lie entirely with a sole commissioner, who is
   assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections. In some New
   England states, counties do not have any governmental function and are
   simply a division of land.

Town and village government[edit]

   Thousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city
   governments. These are chartered as towns and villages and deal with
   local needs such as paving and lighting the streets, ensuring a water
   supply, providing police and fire protection, and waste management. In
   many states of the US, the term town does not have any specific
   meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places
   (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in
   some states, the term town is equivalent to how civil townships are
   used in other states.

   The government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council,
   which may be known by a variety of names: town or village council,
   board of selectmen, board of supervisors, board of commissioners. The
   board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief
   executive officer, or there may be an elected mayor. Governmental
   employees may include a clerk, treasurer, police and fire officers, and
   health and welfare officers.

   One unique aspect of local government, found mostly in the New England
   region of the United States, is the town meeting. Once a year,
   sometimes more often if needed, the registered voters of the town meet
   in open session to elect officers, debate local issues, and pass laws
   for operating the government. As a body, they decide on road
   construction and repair, construction of public buildings and
   facilities, tax rates, and the town budget. The town meeting, which has
   existed for more than three centuries in some places, is often cited as
   the purest form of direct democracy, in which the governmental power is
   not delegated, but is exercised directly and regularly by all the
   people.

Campaign finance[edit]

   Main article: Campaign finance in the United States

   Successful participation, especially in federal elections, requires
   large amounts of money, especially for television advertising.^[22]
   This money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base,^[23]
   although in the 2008 election, candidates from both parties had success
   with raising money from citizens over the Internet,^[24] as had Howard
   Dean with his Internet appeals. Both parties generally depend on
   wealthy donors and organizations—traditionally the Democrats depended
   on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on
   business donations^[citation needed]. This dependency on donors is
   controversial, and has led to laws limiting spending on political
   campaigns being enacted (see campaign finance reform). Opponents of
   campaign finance laws cite the First Amendment's guarantee of free
   speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to
   circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights. Even when
   laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First
   Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation,
   leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in
   comparison to those of other countries such as the United Kingdom,
   France or Canada.

   Fundraising plays a large role in getting a candidate elected to public
   office. Without large sums of money, a candidate has very little chance
   of achieving their goal. In the 2004 general elections, 95% of House
   races and 91% of senate races were won by the candidates who spent the
   most on their campaigns. Attempts to limit the influence of money on
   American political campaigns dates back to the 1860s. Recently,
   Congress passed legislation requiring candidates to disclose sources of
   campaign contributions, how the campaign money is spent, and regulated
   use of “soft money” contributions. (brookings.edu)^[25]

   The 2012 presidential campaign was slow to develop in both candidates
   and fundraising. For example, by the end of September, the financial
   positions of Republican contenders in the cycle were worse than those
   of Democrats at the same point in the 2004 campaign. (opensecrets.org)

Political parties and elections[edit]

   The United States Constitution has never formally addressed the issue
   of political parties, primarily because the Founding Fathers did not
   originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In Federalist
   Papers No. 9 and No. 10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison,
   respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic
   political factions. In addition, the first President of the United
   States, George Washington, was not a member of any political party at
   the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president.
   Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed,
   fearing conflict and stagnation.^[26] Nevertheless, the beginnings of
   the American two-party system emerged from his immediate circle of
   advisers, including Hamilton and Madison.

   In partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or
   seek public office as an independent. Each state has significant
   discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible
   to appear on the election ballot. Typically, major party candidates are
   formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party
   and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process.

Political parties[edit]

   Main article: Political parties in the United States

   The modern political party system in the United States is a two-party
   system dominated by the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
   These two parties have won every United States presidential election
   since 1852 and have controlled the United States Congress since 1856.
   The Democratic Party generally positions itself as left-of-center in
   American politics and supports a modern American liberal platform,
   while the Republican Party generally positions itself as
   right-of-center and supports a modern American conservative platform.

   Third parties have achieved relatively minor representation from time
   to time at local levels. The Libertarian Party is the largest third
   party in the country, claiming more than 250,000 registered
   voters;^[27] it generally positions itself as centrist or radical
   centrist and supports a classical liberal position. Other contemporary
   third parties include the left-wing Green Party, supporting Green
   politics, and the right-wing Constitution Party.

Elections[edit]

   For more details on this topic, see Elections in the United States.

   Unlike in some parliamentary systems, Americans vote for a specific
   candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party.
   With a federal government, officials are elected at the federal
   (national), state and local levels. On a national level, the President,
   is elected indirectly by the people, through an Electoral College. In
   modern times, the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote
   of their state. All members of Congress, and the offices at the state
   and local levels are directly elected.

   Both federal and state laws regulate elections. The United States
   Constitution defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are
   held, in Article One and Article Two and various amendments. State law
   regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the
   eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the
   running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and
   local elections.

Organization of American political parties[edit]

   See also: Political party strength in U.S. states

   American political parties are more loosely organized than those in
   other countries. The two major parties, in particular, have no formal
   organization at the national level that controls membership,
   activities, or policy positions, though some state affiliates do. Thus,
   for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or
   Republican party, is quite different from a Briton's stating that he or
   she is a member of the Conservative or Labour party. In the United
   States, one can often become a "member" of a party, merely by stating
   that fact. In some U.S. states, a voter can register as a member of one
   or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another
   party. Such participation does not restrict one's choices in any way.
   It also does not give a person any particular rights or obligations
   within the party, other than possibly allowing that person to vote in
   that party's primary elections. A person may choose to attend meetings
   of one local party committee one day and another party committee the
   next day. The sole factor that brings one "closer to the action" is the
   quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the
   ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility.

   Party identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for
   partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a
   candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter
   that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may
   choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the
   nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote
   in the primary, and it is often difficult to tell who is going to do
   the voting.

   The result is that American political parties have weak central
   organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. A party
   really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of
   positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from
   claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in
   the primary elections elect that person. Once in office, an elected
   official may change parties simply by declaring such intent.

   At the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national
   committee (See, Democratic National Committee, Republican National
   Committee) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign
   activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact
   composition of these committees is different for each party, but they
   are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and
   affiliated organizations, and others important to the party. However,
   the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities
   of members of the party.

   Both parties also have separate campaign committees which work to elect
   candidates at a specific level. The most significant of these are the
   Hill committees, which work to elect candidates to each house of
   Congress.

   State parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ
   according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and
   the state level.

   Despite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed
   as national races between the political parties. In what is known as
   "presidential coattails", candidates in presidential elections become
   the de facto leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring
   out supporters who in turn then vote for his party's candidates for
   other offices. On the other hand, federal midterm elections (where only
   Congress and not the president is up for election) are usually regarded
   as a referendum on the sitting president's performance, with voters
   either voting in or out the president's party's candidates, which in
   turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the
   president's agenda, respectively.^[28]^[29]

General developments[edit]

   See also: History of the United States Republican Party and History of
   the United States Democratic Party

   Most of the Founding Fathers rejected political parties as divisive and
   disruptive. By the 1790s, however, most joined one of the two new
   parties, and by the 1830s parties had become accepted as central to the
   democracy.^[30] By the 1790s, the First Party System was born. Men who
   held opposing views strengthened their cause by identifying and
   organizing men of like mind. The followers of Alexander Hamilton, were
   called "Federalists"; they favored a strong central government that
   would support the interests of national defense, commerce and industry.
   The followers of Thomas Jefferson, the Jeffersonians took up the name
   "Republicans"; they preferred a decentralized agrarian republic in
   which the federal government had limited power.^[31]^[32]

   By 1828, the First Party System had collapsed. Two new parties emerged
   from the remnants of the Jeffersonian Democracy, forming the Second
   Party System with the Whigs, brought to life in opposition to President
   Andrew Jackson and his new Democratic Party. The forces of Jacksonian
   Democracy, based among urban workers, Southern poor whites, and western
   farmers, dominated the era.^[33]

   In the 1860s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement
   in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted
   in the country's new territories in the West. The Whig Party straddled
   the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat
   by Franklin Pierce in the 1852 presidential election. Ex-Whigs joined
   the Know Nothings or the newly formed Republican Party. While the Know
   Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense
   politics leading up to the Civil War. The primary Republican policy was
   that slavery be excluded from all the territories. Just six years
   later, this new party captured the presidency when Abraham Lincoln won
   the election of 1860. By then, parties were well established as the
   country's dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had
   become an important part of most people's consciousness. Party loyalty
   was passed from fathers to sons, and party activities, including
   spectacular campaign events, complete with uniformed marching groups
   and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many
   communities.

   By the 1920s, however, this boisterous folksiness had diminished.
   Municipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and
   presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national
   conventions had all helped to clean up politics.

Development of the two-party system in the United States[edit]

   Since the 1790s, the country has been run by two major parties. Many
   minor or third political parties appear from time to time. They tend to
   serve a means to advocate policies that eventually are adopted by the
   two major political parties. At various times the Socialist Party, the
   Farmer-Labor Party and the Populist Party for a few years had
   considerable local strength, and then faded away—although in Minnesota,
   the Farmer–Labor Party merged into the state's Democratic Party, which
   is now officially known as the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party. At
   present, the Libertarian Party is the most successful third party. New
   York State has a number of additional third parties, who sometimes run
   their own candidates for office and sometimes nominate the nominees of
   the two main parties.^[34] In the District of Columbia, the D.C.
   Statehood Green Party has served as a strong third party behind the
   Democratic Party and Republican Party.^[35]

   Most officials in America are elected from single-member districts and
   win office by beating out their opponents in a system for determining
   winners called first-past-the-post; the one who gets the plurality
   wins, (which is not the same thing as actually getting a majority of
   votes). This encourages the two-party system; see Duverger's law. In
   the absence of multi-seat congressional districts, proportional
   representation is impossible and third parties cannot thrive. Although
   elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency (state),
   staggered terms effectively result in single-seat constituencies for
   elections to the Senate.

   Another critical factor has been ballot access law. Originally, voters
   went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported.
   Later on, this developed into a process whereby each political party
   would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party's
   ballot into the voting box. In the late nineteenth century, states
   began to adopt the Australian Secret Ballot Method, and it eventually
   became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the
   privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no
   longer be awarded to loyal voters) and each state would be responsible
   for creating one official ballot. The fact that state legislatures were
   dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an
   opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political
   parties, yet such laws did not start to arise until the first Red Scare
   that hit America after World War I. State legislatures began to enact
   tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run
   candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures
   from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition
   could legally be circulated.

   It should also be noted that while more often than not, party members
   will "toe the line" and support their party's policies, they are free
   to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition ("cross
   the aisle") when they please.

   "In America the same political labels (Democratic and Republican) cover
   virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are
   everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties," says Nelson W.
   Polsby, professor of political science, in the book New Federalist
   Papers: Essays in Defense of the Constitution. "Yet Democrats and
   Republicans are not everywhere the same. Variations (sometimes subtle,
   sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield
   considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote,
   Democratic or Republican. These differences suggest that one may be
   justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking
   something more like a hundred-party system."

Gerrymandering[edit]

   Main article: Gerrymandering in the United States
   U.S. congressional districts covering Travis County, Texas (outlined in
   red) in 2002, left, and 2004, right. In 2003, the majority of
   Republicans in the Texas legislature redistricted the state, diluting
   the voting power of the heavily Democratic county by parcelling its
   residents out to more Republican districts.
   Shaw v. Reno was a United States Supreme Court case involving the
   redistricting and racial gerrymandering of North Carolina's 12th
   congressional district (pictured).

   The United States has a long tradition of gerrymandering. In some
   states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from
   both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries
   in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent
   representatives from both parties. Rather than allowing more political
   influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from
   politicians and given it to non-partisan redistricting commissions. The
   states of Washington,^[36] Arizona,^[37] and California's Proposition
   11 (2008) and Proposition 20 (2010) have created standing committees
   for redistricting following the 2010 census. Rhode Island^[38] and New
   Jersey have developed ad hoc committees, but developed the past two
   decennial reapportionments tied to new census data. Florida's
   amendments 5 and 6, meanwhile, established rules for the creation of
   districts but did not mandate an independent commission.^[39]

   International election observers from the Organization for Security and
   Co-operation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
   Rights, who were invited to observe and report on the 2004 national
   elections, expressed criticism of the U.S. congressional redistricting
   process and made a recommendation that the procedures be reviewed to
   ensure genuine competitiveness of Congressional election contests.^[40]

Political pressure groups[edit]

   See also: Advocacy group and Lobbying in the United States

   Special interest groups advocate the cause of their specific
   constituency. Business organizations will favor low corporate taxes and
   restrictions of the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support
   minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargaining.
   Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are
   more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their
   organizations or their beliefs.

   The Israel lobby is the diverse coalition of those who, as individuals
   and as groups, seek to influence the foreign policy of the United
   States in support of Zionism, Israel or the specific policies of its
   government.^[41] The Israel lobby is known for its success in
   encouraging U.S. lawmakers to support the policies that it supports.

   One type of private interest group that has grown in number and
   influence in recent years is the political action committee or PAC.
   These are independent groups, organized around a single issue or set of
   issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for U.S. Congress
   or the presidency. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute
   directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions,
   however, on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a
   point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office. PACs
   today number in the thousands.^[citation needed]

   "The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of
   them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves
   directly to Congress and federal agencies," says Michael Schudson in
   his 1998 book The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life. "Many
   organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral
   support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow
   set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of
   enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens'
   dollars, time, and passion."

   The amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow,
   as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans have the
   feeling that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions or
   PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to
   counteract their influences.

   Some views suggest that the political structure of the United States is
   in many respects an oligarchy.^[42] Some academic researchers suggest
   that the drift to an oligarchy has been happening through the influence
   of corporations, the wealthy, and other special interest groups, as
   individual citizens have less impact than economic elites and organized
   interest groups upon public policy.^[43]^[44]^[45]^[46]^[47]

   A study by political scientists Martin Gilens (Princeton University)
   and Benjamin Page (Northwestern University) released in April 2014
   suggested that when the preferences of a majority of citizens conflicts
   with elites, elites tend to prevail.^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]
   While not characterizing the US as an "oligarchy" or "plutocracy"
   outright, Gilens and Page do apply the concept of "civil oligarchy" as
   used by Jeffrey A. Winters with respect to the US.

     ...Winters has posited a comparative theory of “Oligarchy,” in which
     the wealthiest citizens – even in a “civil oligarchy” like the
     United States – dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth-
     and income-protection.

   E.J. Dionne Jr. interprets decisions by the Supreme Court as allowing
   wealthy elites to use economic power to influence political outcomes in
   their favor.^[54]
   Paul Krugman said:

     The stark reality is that we have a society in which money is
     increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people. This
     threatens to make us a democracy in name only.

   —Paul Krugman, 2012 ^[55]
