    This article has multiple issues. Please help improve it or discuss
   these issues on the talk page.

   This article needs attention from an expert in United States. The
   specific problem is: lacks balance. WikiProject United States (or its
   Portal) may be able to help recruit an expert. (August 2012)

   The lead section of this article may need to be rewritten. Please
   discuss this issue on the talk page and read the layout guide to make
   sure the section will be inclusive of all essential details. (October

   Drug use has increased in all categories since the beginning of
   prohibition on January 17, 1920,^[1] with the exception of opium; its
   use is at a fraction of its peak level. A major decline in the use of
   opium started after the Harrison Act of 1914 was initiated.^[2] Use of
   heroin peaked between 1969 and 1971, marijuana between 1978 and 1979,
   and cocaine between 1987 and 1989.^[3]

   Between 1972 and 1988, the use of cocaine increased more than
   fivefold.^[4] The usage patterns of the current two most culturally
   popular drugs: amphetamines and ecstasy, have shown similar gains.^[1]

   Secretly, many senior officials of the Reagan administration illegally
   trained and armed the Nicaraguan Contras, who were funded by the
   shipment of large quantities of cocaine into the United States using
   U.S. government aircraft and U.S. military facilities.^[5]^[6] Funding
   for the Contras was also obtained through the illegal sale of weaponry
   to Iran.^[7]^[8] When this practice was discovered and condemned in the
   media, it was referred to as the Iran–Contra affair.

   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, legalizing the
   growing and use of marijuana for medical purposes. This created
   significant legal and enforcement conflict between federal and state
   government laws. Courts have since decided that a state law in conflict
   with a federal law concerning cannabis is not valid. Cannabis is
   restricted by federal law (see Gonzales v. Raich). In 2010 California
   Proposition 19 (also known as the Regulate, Control & Tax Cannabis Act)
   was defeated with 53.5% 'No' votes, and 46.5% 'Yes' votes.^[9]

   Pursuant to regulations (34 C.F.R. 86) required by the Drug-Free
   Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 (codified at 20
   U.S.C. § 1011i), as a condition of receiving funds or any other form of
   financial assistance under any Federal program, an institution of
   higher education must certify that it has adopted and implemented a
   drug prevention program which adheres to regulations in 34 C.F.R.
   86.100. It has recently gained renewed attention due to Colorado
   Amendment 64.^[10]
