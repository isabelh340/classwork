   The Eighteenth Amendment (Amendment XVIII) of the United States
   Constitution effectively established the prohibition of alcoholic
   beverages in the United States by declaring the production, transport
   and sale of (though not the consumption or private possession of)
   alcohol illegal. The separate Volstead Act set down methods of
   enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment, and defined which "intoxicating
   liquors" were prohibited, and which were excluded from prohibition
   (e.g., for medical and religious purposes). The Amendment was the first
   to set a time delay before it would take effect following ratification,
   and the first to set a time limit for its ratification by the states.
   Its ratification was certified on January 16, 1919, with the amendment
   taking effect on January 17, 1920.

   The police, courts and prisons were overwhelmed with new cases;
   organized crime increased in power, and corruption extended among law
   enforcement officials. The amendment was repealed in 1933 by
   ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, the only instance in United
   States history that a constitutional amendment was repealed in its
   entirety.

Text[edit]

     Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the
     manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within,
     the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the
     United States and all the territory subject to the jurisdiction
     thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.

     Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent
     power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

     Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have
     been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the
     legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution,
     within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the
     States by the Congress.

Background[edit]

   Main article: Prohibition in the United States

   The Eighteenth Amendment was the result of decades of effort by the
   temperance movement in the United States and at the time was generally
   considered a progressive amendment.^[1]

   Many state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior
   to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment, but didn't ban
   consumption of alcohol in most households.

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   Amendment XVIII in the National Archives

   On August 1, 1917, the Senate passed a resolution containing the
   language of the amendment to be presented to the states for
   ratification. The vote was 65 to 20, with the Democrats voting 36 in
   favor and 12 in opposition; and the Republicans voting 29 in favor and
   8 in opposition. The House of Representatives passed a revised
   resolution^[2] on December 17, 1917.

   In the House, the vote was 282 to 128, with the Democrats voting 146 in
   favor and 64 in opposition; and the Republicans voting 137 in favor and
   62 in opposition.^[3] It was officially proposed by the Congress to the
   states when the Senate passed the resolution, by a vote of 47 to 8, the
   next day, December 18.^[4]

   The amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption
   of alcohol, but made it difficult to obtain alcoholic beverages
   legally, as it prohibited the sale and distribution of them in U.S.
   territory.

   The proposed amendment was the first to contain a provision setting a
   deadline for its ratification. That clause of the amendment was
   challenged, with the case reaching the US Supreme Court. It upheld the
   constitutionality of such a deadline in Dillon v. Gloss (1921).

   The ratification of the Amendment was completed on January 16, 1919,
   when Nebraska became the 36th of the 48 states then in the Union to
   ratify it. On January 29, acting Secretary of State Frank L. Polk
   certified the ratification.^[5]

   The following states ratified the amendment:^[6]

   Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol

   To define the language used in the Amendment, Congress enacted enabling
   legislation called the National Prohibition Act, better known as the
   Volstead Act, on October 28, 1919. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed that
   bill, but the House of Representatives immediately voted to override
   the veto and the Senate voted similarly the next day. The Volstead Act
   set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for January 17, 1920,
   which was the earliest date allowed by the 18th Amendment.^[3]

Impact[edit]

   Following the 18th Amendment's adoption, there was a significant
   reduction in alcohol consumption among the general public. Likewise
   there was a general reduction in overall crime, mainly in the types of
   crimes associated with the effects of alcohol consumption. Though there
   were significant increases in crimes involved in the production and
   distribution of illegal alcohol to supply the segment of the population
   that refused to quit alcohol. Those who continued to use alcohol tended
   to turn organized criminal syndicates, who were able to take advantage
   of weak enforcement, understaffed police forces, and corrupt public
   officials to establish powerful smuggling networks. Anti-prohibition
   groups arose shortly after the amendments, and backed by powerful
   business interests and media members were able in over a decade of
   activism, advocacy, legal disobedience, and legal action to build
   enough opposition to have prohibition repealed.^[9]

   The 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment on December 5, 1933. The
   amendment remains the only constitutional amendment to be repealed in
   its entirety; leaving only the power to regulate transportation solely
   to the federal government.^[10]
