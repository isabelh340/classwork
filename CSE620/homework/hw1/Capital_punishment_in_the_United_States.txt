   Capital punishment (also called the death penalty or execution) in the
   United States is a legal sentence in 32 states^[1] and the federal
   civilian and military legal systems. Its application is limited by the
   Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution to aggravated
   murders committed by mentally competent adults.

   Capital punishment was a penalty for many felonies under English common
   law, and it was enforced in all of the American colonies prior to the
   Declaration of Independence. The methods of execution and the crimes
   subject to the death penalty vary by state and have changed over time.
   The most common method since 1976 has been lethal injection. Since
   capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, thirty-four states have
   performed executions.

   In 2011, 43 inmates were executed in the United States,^[2] and 3,082
   were on death row^[3] – an execution rate of less than 2%. Many states
   such as Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Ohio, and Arizona regularly execute
   convicted murderers. Texas has performed the most executions by far,
   and Oklahoma has had (through mid-2011) the highest per capita
   execution rate.^[4]

History[edit]

   The United States first legalized and used lethal injection as a method
   of execution.

   The first recorded death sentence in the British North American
   colonies was carried out in 1608 on Captain George Kendall,^[5] who was
   executed by firing squad^[6] at the Jamestown colony for allegedly
   spying for the Spanish government.^[7]

   During the American Revolutionary War, British Major John André was
   hanged by the Continental Army at Tappan, New York on October 2, 1780,
   after being convicted of espionage.

   The Espy file,^[8] compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla,
   lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor
   colonies between 1608 and 1991. From 1930 to 2002, 4,661 executions
   were carried out in the U.S, about two-thirds of them in the first 20
   years.^[9] Additionally, the United States Army executed 135 soldiers
   between 1916 and 1955 (the most recent).^[10]^[11]^[12]

   The largest single execution in United States history was the hanging
   of 38 Dakota people convicted of murder and rape during the brutal
   Dakota War of 1862. They were executed simultaneously on December 26,
   1862, in Mankato, Minnesota. A single blow from an axe cut the rope
   that held the large four-sided platform, and the prisoners (except for
   one whose rope had broken and who had to be re-hanged) fell to their
   deaths.^[13] The second-largest mass execution was also a hanging: the
   execution of 13 African-American soldiers for taking part in the
   Houston Riot of 1917. The largest non-military mass execution occurred
   in one of the original thirteen colonies in 1723, when 26 convicted
   pirates were hanged in Newport, Rhode Island by order of the Admiralty
   Court.^[14]

States without capital punishment[edit]

Abolition before statehood[edit]

   Several states have never had capital punishment, the first being
   Michigan, which abolished it shortly after entering the Union.
   (However, the United States government executed Tony Chebatoris at the
   Federal Correctional Institution in Milan, Michigan in 1938.) Article
   4, Section 46 of Michigan's fourth Constitution (ratified in 1963;
   effective in 1964) prohibits any law providing for the penalty of
   death. Every attempt to overturn that provision has failed, the most
   recent being a ballot proposal in 2004.^[15]

   The two newest states, Alaska and Hawaii, abolished the death penalty
   prior to statehood, though Alaska executed eight men when it was a
   territory (1900–1959).^[16]

     State uses the death penalty.

Other early repeals[edit]

   Other states with long histories of no death penalty include Wisconsin
   (the only state with only one execution), Rhode Island (although later
   reintroduced, it was unused and abolished again), Maine, North Dakota,
   Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Vermont. The District of Columbia
   has also abolished the death penalty; it was last used in 1957. Oregon
   abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964
   public referendum^[17] but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death
   penalty/life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin after a
   similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to
   judicial rulings.

Abolition[edit]

   The District of Columbia and the following 18 states currently do not
   have an enforceable death penalty statute (the year capital punishment
   was abolished is in parentheses):
     * Alaska Alaska (1957)
     * Connecticut Connecticut (2012)^1
     * Hawaii Hawaii (1957)
     * Illinois Illinois (2011)
     * Iowa Iowa (1965)
     * Maine Maine (1887)
     * Maryland Maryland (2013)^1
     * Massachusetts Massachusetts (1984)^2
     * Michigan Michigan (1846)
     * Minnesota Minnesota (1911)
     * New Jersey New Jersey (2007)
     * New Mexico New Mexico (2009)^1
     * New York New York (2007)^2
     * North Dakota North Dakota (1973)
     * Rhode Island Rhode Island (1984)
     * Vermont Vermont (1964)^3
     * West Virginia West Virginia (1965)
     * Wisconsin Wisconsin (1853)

   Notes:
    1. In these states, the death penalty is enforceable for offenses
       committed before the repeal; that is, abolition was not
       retroactive.
    2. In these states, the death penalty statute was struck down by court
       ruling.
    3. Vermont retains capital punishment for treason.

   New Mexico may yet execute two condemned inmates sentenced prior to
   abolition. Connecticut may also execute eleven inmates sentenced before
   abolition. In Illinois, where recent abolition legislation took effect
   on July 1, 2011, all former death row inmates have been moved to
   regular jail cells.^[18] In Maryland, the repeal of the death penalty
   is prospective in nature, as was the case in New Mexico and
   Connecticut. However, Governor Martin O'Malley can commute the
   remaining five death sentences to life without parole, though he has
   yet to decide if he is going to do so. O'Malley plans to look into it
   on a "case by case basis."

   Only five of the above states have legislatively abolished the death
   penalty in the so-called "modern era of capital punishment" (that is,
   post-Gregg v. Georgia), and only two have attained de facto abolition
   through their state judiciaries; the remainder either abolished capital
   punishment before the moratorium was lifted or had statutes that were
   struck down and did not reinstate the death penalty.

   In 2007, New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty
   in the modern system of capital punishment,^[19] followed by New Mexico
   in 2009 (though not retroactively, permitting the future execution of
   two inmates on the state's death row), and Illinois in 2011 (with the
   governor commuting the death sentences of all death row
   inmates).^[20]^[21]^[22] However, in states with a large death row
   population and regular executions, such as Texas,^[23]^[24] the death
   penalty remains strongly in the landscape and is unlikely to end any
   time soon.^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28]^[29]^[30]

   Four states in the modern era, Nebraska in 2008, New York and Kansas in
   2004, and Massachusetts in 1984, had their statutes ruled
   unconstitutional by state courts. The death rows of New York and
   Massachusetts were disestablished. Of the four states, only Nebraska
   has performed executions since the constitutionality of capital
   punishment was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1976, the four states
   having done so last in 1997, 1963, 1965, and 1947, respectively. In New
   York and Massachusetts, attempts to restore the death penalty were
   unsuccessful,^[31]^[32] while Kansas successfully appealed State v.
   Kleypas, the Kansas Supreme Court decision that declared the state's
   death penalty statute unconstitutional, to the U.S. Supreme Court – and
   death sentences continue to be sought. New York had previously
   abolished the death penalty temporarily, in 1860.^[33] Nebraska has
   performed three executions since 1976, all in the 1990s; its statute
   has been ineffective since February 8, 2008, when the method used,
   electrocution, was ruled unconstitutional by the Nebraska Supreme
   Court. However, Nebraska has since enacted a bill providing for
   executions by lethal injection.

   On April 5, 2012, the Connecticut Senate passed a bill (20 to 16) that
   would abolish the death penalty for future crimes. The House of
   Representatives had passed similar bills in earlier sessions, but they
   had always failed to win approval in the Senate. The bill was later
   passed in the House on April 11 (86 to 62), and on April 25, Governor
   Dan Malloy signed the bill into law.^[34]^[35] Connecticut has executed
   only one person in the last 50 years. As with New Mexico, Connecticut's
   repeal of capital punishment is not retroactive, so the 11 inmates
   currently on death row may still be executed, along with those
   convicted of capital crimes committed before the repeal went into
   effect.

   On February 21, 2013, a bill to repeal capital punishment in Maryland
   passed in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Commission 6-5; it passed the
   Senate 27-20 on March 6. The House of Delegates Judicial Committee
   passed the bill 14-8 the week of March 11; the bill passed the House
   82-56 on March 15. It was not until May 2, 2013 that Governor Martin
   O'Malley signed the bill into law. Maryland's repeal of the death
   penalty is not retroactive.^[1]

   The only jurisdictions with current death penalty statutes that have
   not performed an execution since 1976 are New Hampshire, Kansas, and
   the United States military, although all have populated death rows.
   Also, New Jersey executed no one between 1976 and 2007, when it
   abolished the death penalty.

Puerto Rico[edit]

   Main article: Capital punishment in Puerto Rico

   The United States territory of Puerto Rico has no death penalty. Puerto
   Rico instituted a four-year moratorium on the death penalty in 1917.
   The last execution took place in 1927, and the Puerto Rican legislature
   abolished the death penalty in 1929.^[36]

   Puerto Rico's constitution expressly forbids capital punishment,
   stating "The death penalty shall not exist", setting it apart from all
   U.S. states and territories other than Michigan, which also has a
   constitutional prohibition (eleven other states and the District of
   Columbia have abolished capital punishment through statutory law).
   However, capital punishment is still applicable to offenses committed
   in Puerto Rico, if they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal
   government, though federal death penalty prosecutions there have
   generated significant controversy.^[37]

Suspension by the Supreme Court[edit]

   Further information: Furman v. Georgia
   The United States Supreme Court building
   Executions in the United States since 1960

   Capital punishment was suspended in the United States from 1972 through
   1976 primarily as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v.
   Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). The last pre-Furman execution was that of
   Luis Monge on June 2, 1967. In this case, the court found that the
   death penalty was being imposed in an unconstitutional manner, on the
   grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth
   Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has
   never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional.

   In Furman, the Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases.
   The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death
   penalty statute, which featured a "unitary trial" procedure in which
   the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and,
   simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by
   death or life imprisonment.

   In a five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court struck down the
   impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as
   unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a
   common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed
   only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest
   opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed
   generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death
   penalty across a variety of cases but did not exclude the possibility
   of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas
   worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the
   death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan, Jr. expressed
   the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the
   Eighth Amendment as "cruel and unusual" punishment.

   Instead of abandoning capital punishment after Furman, 37 states
   enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the
   concerns of White and Stewart. Some states responded by enacting
   mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death
   for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that
   such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his Furman
   opinion.

   Other states adopted "bifurcated" trial and sentencing procedures, with
   various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a
   death sentence designed to limit juror discretion. The Court clarified
   Furman in Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976) and Roberts v.
   Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325 (1976), 431 U.S. 633 (1977), which explicitly
   forbade any state from punishing a specific form of murder (such as
   that of a police officer) with a mandatory death penalty.

   In 1976, contemporaneously with Woodson and Roberts, the Court decided
   Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976) and upheld a procedure in which
   the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and
   sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the
   defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not
   convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be
   imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain
   statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors
   exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating
   factors in assessing the ultimate penalty – either death or life in
   prison, either with or without parole.

   The 1977 Coker v. Georgia decision barred the death penalty for rape
   and, by implication, for any offense against another person other than
   murder. The current federal kidnapping statute, however, may be exempt
   because the death penalty applies if the victim dies in the
   perpetrator's custody, not necessarily by his hand, thus stipulating a
   resulting death, which was the wording of the objection. In addition,
   the federal government retains the death penalty for such non-murder
   offenses as treason, espionage, and crimes under military jurisdiction
   as these are crimes against the State. There have been no challenges to
   these statutes as of 2007.

   Executions resumed on January 17, 1977, when Gary Gilmore went before a
   firing squad in Utah. But the pace was quite slow due to the use of
   litigation tactics which involved filing repeated writs of habeas
   corpus, which succeeded for many in delaying their actual execution for
   many years. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in
   the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people
   besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually
   executed prior to 1984.

   The Supreme Court has placed two major restrictions on the use of the
   death penalty. First, the case of Atkins v. Virginia, decided on June
   20, 2002,^[38] held that the execution of mentally retarded inmates is
   "cruel and unusual punishment" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.
   Generally, a person with an IQ below 70 is considered to be mentally
   retarded. Prior to this decision, between 1984 and 2002, forty-four
   mentally retarded inmates had been executed in the United States.^[39]

   Second, in 2005, the Supreme Court's decision in Roper v. Simmons, 543
   U.S. 551 (2005) abolished executions for persons under the age of 18 at
   the time of the crime.

   New Mexico repealed its death penalty statute on March 17, 2009,
   becoming the second state (after New Jersey) to abolish the death
   penalty since executions resumed in 1976. The law, signed by Governor
   Bill Richardson, took effect on July 1, 2009 and replaces the death
   penalty with a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The
   law, though, is not retroactive; inmates currently on New Mexico's
   death row and persons convicted of capital offenses committed before
   this date may still be sentenced to death under New Mexico's
   pre-existing death penalty statute.^[40] Connecticut abolished its
   death penalty on April 25, 2012. The measure was first approved by the
   General Assembly in 2009, but vetoed by then-governor M. Jodi
   Rell;^[41] it was approved by her successor, Dan Malloy.^[42] As in New
   Mexico, the Connecticut repeal was not retroactive, leaving 11 inmates
   on death row.

   Possibly in part due to expedited federal habeas corpus procedures
   embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,
   the pace of executions has picked up. Since the death penalty was
   reauthorized in 1976, 1,386 people have been executed, almost
   exclusively by the states, with most occurring after 1990. Texas has
   accounted for over one-third of modern executions^[23]^[24] and over
   four times as many as Oklahoma, the state with the second-highest
   number. California has the greatest number of prisoners on death row
   but has held relatively few executions. See the table for the number of
   executions and death row inmates by jurisdiction.

New concerns post-Furman[edit]

   In the decades since Furman, new questions have emerged about whether
   or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing
   arbitrariness. A study by Pepperdine University School of Law published
   in Temple Law Review, "Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice: An
   Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions," surveyed
   the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The
   authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions
   remain marked by local "idiosyncrasies," suggesting they are not in
   keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means
   that "the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to
   eliminate" may still "infect capital cases." Wide prosecutorial
   discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law,
   for example, has 22 "special circumstances," making nearly all
   premeditated murders potential capital cases. The 37 death penalty
   states have varying numbers and types of "death qualifiers" –
   circumstances that allow for capital charges. The number varies from a
   high of 34 in California to 22 in Colorado and Delaware to 12 in Texas,
   Nebraska, Georgia and Montana. The study's authors call for reform of
   state procedures along the lines of reforms in the federal system,
   which the U.S. Department of Justice initiated with a 1995
   protocol.^[43] Crimes subject to the death penalty vary by
   jurisdiction. All jurisdictions that use capital punishment designate
   the highest grade of murder a capital crime, although most
   jurisdictions require aggravating circumstances. Treason against the
   United States, as well as treason against the states of Arkansas,
   California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri are capital
   offenses.^[44]

   Other capital crimes include: the use of a weapon of mass destruction
   resulting in death, espionage, terrorism, certain violations of the
   Geneva Conventions that result in the death of one or more persons, and
   treason at the federal level; aggravated rape in Louisiana,
   Florida,^[45] and Oklahoma; extortionate kidnapping in Oklahoma;
   aggravated kidnapping in Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky and South Carolina;
   aircraft hijacking in Alabama and Mississippi; assault by an escaping
   capital felon in Colorado; armed robbery in Georgia; drug trafficking
   resulting in a person's death in Florida;^[46] train wrecking which
   leads to a person's death, and perjury which leads to a person's death
   in California, Colorado, Idaho and Nebraska.^[44]^[47]^[48]

   Additionally, the Uniform Code of Military Justice allows capital
   punishment for a list of offenses committed during wartime, including
   desertion, mutiny, spying, assault upon a commanding officer, and
   misconduct before the enemy. In practice, no one has been executed for
   a crime other than murder or conspiracy to murder since James Coburn
   was executed for robbery in Alabama on September 4, 1964.^[49]

   Before 1972, among other crimes, kidnapping was capital in 35 states,
   treason in 26, train wrecking in 15, bomb setting in seven, arson and
   burglary in four, armed robbery in five and assault by a life convict
   in two;^[50] in addition, some capital statutes were peculiar to a
   state such as the statute allowing the issuing of a death sentence for
   grave desecration (Georgia), forcing a woman to marry (Arkansas), or
   possession and use of a machine gun for a crime of violence
   (Virginia).^[51]^[52]

   On June 25, 2008, in Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court ruled
   against Louisiana's death penalty for child rapists, saying "there is a
   distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and
   nonhomicide crimes against individual persons."^[53] The Court went
   further, ruling out the death penalty for any crime against an
   individual (as opposed to "offenses against the state," such as treason
   or espionage) "where the victim's life was not taken."^[54]

   As of November 2008, there is only one person on death row facing
   capital punishment who has not been convicted of murder. Demarcus Sears
   remains under a death sentence in Georgia for the crime of "kidnapping
   with bodily injury." Sears was convicted in 1986 for the kidnapping and
   bodily injury of victim Gloria Ann Wilbur. Wilbur was kidnapped and
   beaten in Georgia, raped in Tennessee, and murdered in Kentucky. Sears
   was never charged with the murder of Wilbur in Kentucky, but was
   sentenced to death by a jury in Georgia for "kidnapping with bodily
   injury."^[55]^[56]

   Several people who were executed have received posthumous pardons for
   their crimes. For example, slave revolt was a capital crime, and many
   who were executed for that reason have since been posthumously
   pardoned.

   Congress acted defiantly toward the Supreme Court by passing the Drug
   Kingpin Act of 1988 and the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 that made
   roughly fifty crimes punishable by death, including crimes that do not
   always involve the death of someone. Such non-death capital offenses
   include treason, espionage (spying for another country), and high-level
   drug trafficking. Since no one has yet been sentenced to death for such
   non-death capital offenses, the Supreme Court has not ruled on their
   constitutionality.^[57]^[58]

Legal process[edit]

   The legal administration of the death penalty in the United States is
   complex. Typically, it involves four critical steps: (1) sentencing,
   (2) direct review, (3) state collateral review, and (4) federal habeas
   corpus. Recently, a narrow and final fifth level of process – (5) the
   Section 1983 challenge – has become increasingly important.^[70]
   (Clemency or pardon, through which the Governor or President of the
   jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is
   an executive rather than judicial process.^[71]) The number of new
   death sentences handed down peaked in 1995–1996 (309). There were 104
   new death sentences handed down in 2010, the lowest number since 1973
   (44).^[72]

Direct review[edit]

   If a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then
   goes into a direct review.^[73] The direct review process is a typical
   legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence
   presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied
   and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not.^[74] Direct
   review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three
   outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors
   occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will
   affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand.^[73] If the appellate
   court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will
   reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital
   sentencing hearing.^[75] Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no
   reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death
   penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not
   guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and
   order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the
   offense is eligible.^[75] About 60 percent survive the process of
   direct review intact.^[76]

State collateral review[edit]

   At times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, it is
   considered final. Yet, supplemental methods to attack the judgment,
   though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These
   supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an
   avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.^[77]
   Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial,
   as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state
   collateral review. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it
   proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.)
   Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process
   varies widely from state to state.^[78] Generally, the purpose of these
   collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his
   sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial
   or on direct review.^[79] Most often these are claims, such as
   ineffective assistance of counsel, which require the court to consider
   new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may
   not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an
   important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review
   through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself.
   Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state
   collateral review.^[80] In 2010, the death sentences of 53 inmates were
   overturned as a result of legal appeals or high court reversals.^[72]

Federal habeas corpus[edit]

   After a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review, the
   prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of
   lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus is
   a species of collateral review, and it is the only way that state
   prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than
   petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both
   direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas
   corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
   of 1996, which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose
   of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the
   process of direct review and state collateral review, have done at
   least a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal
   constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus
   suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime,
   though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process,
   evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.^[81]

   Review through federal habeas corpus is narrow in theory, but it is
   important in practice. According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death
   penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.^[80]

   James Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in
   1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death
   penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case
   that there was "a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from
   1978 to 1995."^[82] Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review
   article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death
   row inmates even higher, finding that between "1976 and 1991,
   approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row
   inmates were granted."^[83] The different numbers are largely
   definitional, rather than substantive. Freedam's statistics looks at
   the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others
   look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review.

   A similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the
   judgment of a federal court.^[84]

Section 1983 contested[edit]

   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a
   state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in
   federal court. If the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of habeas
   corpus, an execution date may be set. In recent times, however,
   prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal
   litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871 — codified at 42
   U.S.C. § 1983 — which allows people to bring lawsuits against state
   actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.

   Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner
   under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas
   corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner
   can challenge his judgment of death.^[85] In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough
   case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of
   Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution
   as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
   The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not
   attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which
   that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court
   held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than
   habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case
   shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits
   challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner
   brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further,
   the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection
   method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity
   for relief through Section 1983.

Mitigating factors[edit]

   The United States Supreme Court in Penry v. Lynaugh and the United
   States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Bigby v. Dretke have
   been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty
   cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the
   defendant's mental health violate the defendant's Eighth Amendment
   rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating
   factors when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that
   specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating
   factors.

Methods[edit]

   Number of executions each year by the method used in the United States
   and the earlier colonies from 1608 to 2004. The adoption of
   electrocution caused a marked drop off in the number of hangings, which
   was used even less with the use of the gas chamber. After Gregg v.
   Georgia, most states changed to lethal injection, leading to its rise.

   Various methods have been used in the history of the American colonies
   and the United States but only five methods are currently used.
   Historically, burning, crushing, breaking on wheel, and bludgeoning
   were used for a small number of executions, while hanging was the most
   common method. The last person burned at the stake was a black slave in
   South Carolina in August 1825.^[86] The last person to be hanged in
   chains was a murderer named John Marshall in West Virginia on April 4,
   1913. Although beheading was a legal method in Utah from 1851 to 1888,
   it was never used.^[87]

   The last use of the firing squad between 1608 and the moratorium on
   judicial executions between 1967 and 1977 was when Utah shot James W.
   Rodgers on March 30, 1960. The last use of the gallows between 1608 and
   the moratorium was when Kansas hanged George York on June 22, 1965. The
   last use of the electric chair between the first electrocution on
   August 6, 1890 and the moratorium was when Oklahoma electrocuted James
   French on August 10, 1966. The last use of the gas chamber between the
   first gassing on February 8, 1924 and the moratorium was when Colorado
   gassed Luis Monge on June 2, 1967.

   The moratorium ended on January 17, 1977 with the shooting of Gary
   Gilmore by firing squad in Utah. The first use of the electric chair
   after the moratorium was the electrocution of John Spenkelink in
   Florida on May 25, 1979. The first use of the gas chamber after the
   moratorium was the gassing of Jesse Bishop in Nevada on October 22,
   1979. The first use of the gallows after the moratorium was the hanging
   of Westley Allan Dodd in Washington on January 5, 1993. December 7,
   1982 is also an important day in the history of capital punishment in
   the United States; Charles Brooks, Jr., put to death in Texas, was the
   first person executed by lethal injection.

   Until the 21st century, electrocution and gassing were the most
   prevalent methods of execution in the United States. The electrocutions
   of John Evans and Horace Franklin Douglas, Jr. in Alabama, Jesse
   Tafero, Pedro Medina, and Allen Lee Davis in Florida, Alpha Otis
   Stephens in Georgia, William E. Vandiver in Indiana, Frank J. Coppola,
   Wilbert Lee Evans, and Derick Lynn Peterson in Virginia, and the
   gassings of Jimmy Lee Gray in Mississippi and Donald Eugene Harding in
   Arizona are often cited by opponents of capital punishment as
   unacceptable outcomes of such methods.^[citation needed]

   Currently, lethal injection is the method used or allowed in all of the
   32 states which allow the death penalty. Nebraska required
   electrocution, but in 2008 the state's supreme court ruled that the
   method was unconstitutional. In mid-2009 Nebraska officially changed
   its method of execution to lethal injection.^[88]^[89]^[90] Other
   states also allow electrocution, firing squad, hanging, and lethal gas.
   From 1976 to August 6, 2014, there were 1,386 executions, of which
   1,211 were by lethal injection, 158 by electrocution, 11 by gas
   chamber, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad.^[91]

   The method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the
   Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the
   state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death
   penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for
   carrying out the execution. For offenses under the Drug Kingpin Act of
   1988, the method of execution is lethal injection. The Federal
   Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana is currently the home of
   the only death chamber for federal death penalty recipients in the
   United States, where inmates are put to death by lethal injection. The
   complex has so far been the only location used for federal executions
   post-Gregg. Timothy McVeigh and Juan Garza were put to death in June
   2001, and Louis Jones, Jr. was put to death on March 18, 2003.

   In 2004, Utah made lethal injection the only form of capital
   punishment. However, those already on death row were grandfathered on
   the type of execution they chose at sentencing. At the time of the
   change in the law there were still three inmates on Utah's death row
   who had selected firing squad.

   The use of lethal injection has become standard. The last executions by
   other methods are as follows:
      Method                 Date              State         Convict
   Electrocution 02013-01-16-0000Jan 16, 2013 Virginia Robert Gleason

   Hanging       01996-01-25-0000Jan 25, 1996 Delaware William Bailey

   The two states that still allow hanging^[93] are New Hampshire, which
   allows it at the decision of the Corrections officials,^[94] and
   Washington, at the decision of the prisoner.^[95]

   Electrocution was the preferred method of execution during the 20th
   century. Electric chairs have commonly been nicknamed Old Sparky;
   however, Alabama's electric chair became known as the "Yellow Mama" due
   to its unique color. Some, particularly in Florida, were noted for
   malfunctions, which caused discussion of their cruelty and resulted in
   a shift to lethal injection as the preferred method of execution.
   Although lethal injection dominates as a method of execution, some
   states allow prisoners on death row to choose the method used to
   execute them.

   Regardless of the method, an hour or two before the execution, the
   condemned person is offered religious services and a last meal (except
   in Texas), the contents of which are often released to the news
   media^[citation needed]. Executions are carried out in private with
   only invited persons able to view the proceedings; in some cases,
   journalists have reserved spots, such as in Texas, where The Associated
   Press is entitled to send a reporter to witness each
   execution^[citation needed].

   In the 2010s, American jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of
   lethal injection drugs, due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low
   production volume. Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium
   thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011. The European Union has
   outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution;
   this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anethetics
   like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes. Another
   alternative, pentobarbital, is also only manufactured in the European
   Union, which has caused the Danish producer to restrict distribution to
   U.S. government customers.^[96]

Debate[edit]

   Main article: Capital punishment debate in the United States
   The execution of William Kemmler, August 6, 1890

   Capital punishment is a controversial issue, with many prominent
   organizations and individuals participating in the debate. Amnesty
   International and some religions oppose capital punishment on moral
   grounds, while the Innocence Project works to free wrongly convicted
   prisoners, including death row inmates, based on newly available DNA
   tests. Other groups, such as some law enforcement organizations, and
   some victims' rights groups support capital punishment.

   The United States is one of only four industrialized democracies that
   still practice capital punishment. From the others, Japan and Singapore
   have executed prisoners, like the United States, while South Korea
   currently has a moratorium in effect. In 2011, the United States was
   the only source of executions (43) in the G8 countries or Western
   Hemisphere.^[97]

   Elections have sometimes turned on the issue; in 1986, three justices
   were removed from the Supreme Court of California by the electorate
   (including Chief Justice Rose Bird) partly because of their opposition
   to the death penalty.

   Religious groups are widely split on the issue of capital
   punishment,.^[98] The Fiqh Council of North America, a group of highly
   influential Muslim scholars in the United States, has issued a fatwa
   calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States
   until various preconditions in the legal system are met.^[99]

   In October 2009, the American Law Institute voted to disavow the
   framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962, as part
   of the Model Penal Code, "in light of the current intractable
   institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate
   system for administering capital punishment." A study commissioned by
   the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of
   individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of
   systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be
   reconciled.^[100]

   In total, 142 prisoners have been either acquitted, or received pardons
   or commutations on the basis of possible innocence, since 1973.^[101]
   Death penalty opponents often argue that this statistic shows how
   perilously close states have come to undertaking wrongful executions;
   proponents point out that the statistic refers only to those exonerated
   in law, and that the truly innocent may be a smaller number. Statistics
   likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because
   once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation
   and finance to keep a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point
   that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed. In the case of
   Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and
   murder, a prosecuting attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if
   posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, "it would be shouted from the
   rooftops that ... Virginia executed an innocent man." The state
   prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.^[102]

   Arguments for and against capital punishment are based on moral,
   practical, and religious grounds. Advocates of the death penalty argue
   that it deters crime, is a good tool for prosecutors (in plea
   bargaining for example),^[103] improves the community by eliminating
   recidivism by executed criminals, provides closure to surviving victims
   or loved ones, and is a just penalty for the crimes it punishes.

   Opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of
   deterring crime,^[104] risks the execution of the innocent, is
   unnecessarily barbaric in nature, cheapens human life, and puts a
   government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in
   murder.^[105] Furthermore, some opponents argue that the arbitrariness
   with which it is administered and the systemic influence of racial,
   socio-economic, geographic, and gender bias on determinations of desert
   make the current practice of capital punishment immoral and
   illegitimate.^[106]

   Another argument (specific to the United States) in the capital
   punishment debate is the cost. The convict is more likely to use the
   whole appeals process if the jury issues a death sentence than if it
   issues life without parole.^[107] But others who contest this argument
   say that the greater cost of appeals where the prosecution does seek
   the death penalty is offset by the savings from avoiding trial
   altogether in cases where the defendant pleads guilty to avoid the
   death penalty.^[108]

   As noted in the introduction to this article, the American public has
   recently maintained its position of support for capital punishment for
   murder. However, when given a choice between the death penalty and life
   imprisonment without parole, support has traditionally been
   significantly lower than polling which has only mentioned the death
   penalty as a punishment; in the 2010 poll, for instance, the disparity
   narrowed, with 49 percent favoring the death penalty and 46 percent
   favoring life imprisonment.^[109] The highest level of support recorded
   overall was 80 percent in 1994 (16 percent opposed), and the lowest
   recorded was 42 percent in 1966 (47 percent opposed); on the question
   of the death penalty vs. life without parole, the strongest preference
   for the death penalty was 61 percent in 1997 (29 percent favoring
   life), and the lowest preference for the death penalty was 47 percent
   in 2006 (48 percent favoring life).^[110]

   After the September 2011 execution of Troy Davis, believed by many to
   be innocent, Richard Dieter, the director of the Death Penalty
   Information Center, said this case was a clear wake-up call to
   politicians across the United States. He said: "They weren't expecting
   such passion from people in opposition to the death penalty. There's a
   widely held perception that all Americans are united in favour of
   executions, but this message came across loud and clear that many
   people are not happy with it." Brian Evans of Amnesty International,
   which led the campaign to spare Davis's life, said that there was a
   groundswell in America of people "who are tired of a justice system
   that is inhumane and inflexible and allows executions where there is
   clear doubts about guilt". He predicted the debate would now be
   conducted with renewed energy.^[111]

Minimum age[edit]

   Executions in the United States from 1608 to 2009
   Executions in the United States from 1930 to 2009
   Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953
   to 2008

   Since 1642 (in the 13 colonies, the United States under the Articles of
   Confederation, and the current United States) an estimated 364 juvenile
   offenders have been put to death by the states and the federal
   government. The earliest known execution of a prisoner for crimes
   committed as a juvenile was Thomas Graunger in 1642. Twenty-two of the
   executions occurred after 1976, in seven states. Due to the slow
   process of appeals, it was highly unusual for a condemned person to be
   under 18 at the time of execution. The youngest person to be executed
   in the 20th century was George Stinney, who was electrocuted in South
   Carolina at the age of 14 on June 16, 1944. The last execution of a
   juvenile may have been Leonard Shockley, who died in the Maryland gas
   chamber on April 10, 1959, at the age of 17. No one has been under age
   19 at time of execution since at least 1964.^[112] Since the
   reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, 22 people have been
   executed for crimes committed under the age of 18. Twenty-one were 17
   at the time of the crime. The last person to be executed for a crime
   committed as a juvenile was Scott Hain on April 3, 2003 in
   Oklahoma.^[113]

   Before 2005, of the 38 U.S. states that allow capital punishment:
     * 19 states and the federal government had set a minimum age of 18,
     * 5 states had set a minimum age of 17, and
     * 14 states had explicitly set a minimum age of 16, or were subject
       to the Supreme Court's imposition of that minimum.

   Sixteen was held to be the minimum permissible age in the 1988 Supreme
   Court decision of Thompson v. Oklahoma. The Court, considering the case
   Roper v. Simmons in March 2005, found the execution of juvenile
   offenders unconstitutional by a 5–4 margin, effectively raising the
   minimum permissible age to 18. State laws have not been updated to
   conform with this decision. In the American legal system,
   unconstitutional laws do not need to be repealed; instead, they are
   held to be unenforceable. (See also List of juvenile offenders executed
   in the United States)

Distribution of sentences[edit]

   Within the context of the overall murder rate, the death penalty cannot
   be said to be widely or routinely used in the United States; in recent
   years the average has been about one execution for about every 700
   murders committed, or 1 execution for about every 325 murder
   convictions. However, 32 of the 50 states still execute people. Among
   them, Alabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences. This
   is due to judges overriding life imprisonment sentences and imposing
   the death penalty. No other states allow this.^[114]

Among those sentenced[edit]

   The death penalty is sought and applied more often in some
   jurisdictions, not only between states but within states. A 2004
   Cornell University study showed that while 2.5 percent of murderers
   convicted nationwide were sentenced to the death penalty, in Nevada
   6 percent were given the death penalty.^[115] Texas gave 2 percent of
   murderers a death sentence, less than the national average. Texas,
   however, executed 40 percent of those sentenced, which was about four
   times higher than the national average. California had executed only
   1 percent of those sentenced.

Among races[edit]

   African Americans made up 41 percent of death row inmates while making
   up only 12 percent of the general population. (They have made up
   34 percent of those actually executed since 1976.)^[116] However, that
   number is lower than that of prison inmates, which is 47 percent.^[117]
   According to the US Department of Justice, African Americans accounted
   for 52.5% of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with whites 45.3%
   and Native Americans and Asians 2.2%.^[118] According to a 2003 Amnesty
   International report, Blacks and Whites were the victims of murder in
   almost equal numbers, yet 80 percent of the people executed since 1977
   were convicted of murders involving white victims.^[116]

   A summary of executions in Texas since 1982 concludes:
     * White (216) (46 percent, pop. ~80 percent)
     * Black (172) (37 percent, pop. ~12 percent)
     * Latin (78) (16 percent, pop. ~16 percent)
     * Asian (2) (0.4 percent, pop. ~5 percent)

   (Percentage totals exceed 100 percent due to mixed race.)

   According to the Death Penalty Information Center there were 46
   executions in the United States in 2010 and 55 percent of those people
   were white and 76 percent of the victims were white as well. As of
   January 1, 2011 there were 3251 people sitting on death row and
   44 percent of those people are white.

Among genders[edit]

   As of October 31, 2010:^[119]
     * men account for 98.3 percent (3206) of the persons currently on
       death row, while women account for 1.7 percent (55).
     * men account for 99 percent (1220) of the persons executed in recent
       years, while women account for 1.0 percent (12).

Location of executions: public versus private[edit]

   Passers-by abusing the bodies of Union supporters near Knoxville,
   Tennessee. The two were hanged by Confederate authorities near the
   railroad tracks so passing train passengers could see them.

   The last public execution in America was that of Rainey Bethea in
   Owensboro, Kentucky, on August 14, 1936. It was the last execution in
   the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without
   any legally imposed restrictions. "Public execution" is a legal phrase,
   defined by the laws of various states, and carried out pursuant to a
   court order. Similar to "public record" or "public meeting," it means
   that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so.

   Around 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to
   mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required
   executions to be conducted within a "wall" or "enclosure" to "exclude
   public view." For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a
   statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, "the sentence of death should
   be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within
   an enclosure near the jail." The Missouri law permitted the local
   sheriff to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens)
   who he believed should witness the hanging, but the sheriffs – for
   various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to
   watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not "public"
   because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public
   was not permitted to attend.

   Present-day statutes from across the nation use the same words and
   phrases, requiring modern executions to take place within a wall or
   enclosure to exclude public view. Connecticut General Statute § 54–100
   requires death sentences to be conducted in an "enclosure" which "shall
   be so constructed as to exclude public view." Kentucky Revised Statute
   431.220 and Missouri Revised Statute § 546.730 contain substantially
   identical language. New Mexico's former death penalty, since repealed,
   see N.M. Stat. § 31-14-12, required executions be conducted in a "room
   or place enclosed from public view." Similarly, a dormant Massachusetts
   law, see Mass. Gen. Law ch. 279 § 60, required executions to take place
   "within an enclosure or building." North Carolina General Statute §
   15-188 requires death sentences to be executed "within the walls" of
   the penitentiary, as do Oklahoma Statute Title 22 § 1015 and Montana
   Code § 46-19-103. Ohio Revised Code § 2949.22 requires that "[t]he
   enclosure shall exclude public view." Similarly, Tennessee Code §
   40-23-116 requires "an enclosure" for "strict seclusion and privacy."
   United States Code Title 18 § 3596 and the Code of Federal Regulations
   28 CFR 26.4 limit the witnesses permitted at federal executions.

   Today, there are always witnesses to executions, but it is the law, not
   the number of witnesses present, that determines whether the execution
   is "public."

   All of the executions which have taken place since the 1936 hanging of
   Bethea in Owensboro have been conducted within a wall or enclosure. For
   example, Fred Adams was legally hanged in Kennett, Missouri, on April
   2, 1937, within a 10-foot (3 m) wooden stockade. Roscoe "Red" Jackson
   was hanged within a stockade in Galena, Missouri, on May 26, 1937. Two
   Kentucky hangings were conducted after Galena in which numerous persons
   were present within a wooden stockade, that of John "Peter" Montjoy in
   Covington, Kentucky on December 17, 1937, and that of Harold Van
   Venison in Covington on June 3, 1938. An estimated 400 witnesses were
   present for the hanging of Lee Simpson in Ryegate, Montana, on December
   30, 1939. The execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001 was
   witnessed by some 300 people, some by closed-circuit television.

Clemency and commutations[edit]

   The largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in
   Illinois when outgoing Governor George Ryan, who had already imposed a
   moratorium on executions, pardoned four death-row inmates and commuted
   the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the
   possibility of parole.^[120] When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation
   abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011, he commuted the
   sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life
   imprisonment.^[20]

   Previous post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico,
   when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his
   personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio
   Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among
   them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms
   (1979–1987) as Florida's Governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death
   penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary
   execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six
   people on the grounds of "possible innocence" or "disproportionality."

Suicide on death row and volunteering for execution[edit]

   The suicide rate of death row inmates was found by Lester and Tartaro
   to be 113 per 100,000 for the period 1976–1999. This is about ten times
   the rate of suicide in the United States as a whole and about six times
   the rate of suicide in the general U.S. prison population.^[121]

   Since the reinstitution of the death penalty, 143 prisoners have waived
   their appeals and asked that the execution be carried out. Four states
   (Connecticut, New Mexico, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) have executed only
   volunteers since the end of the moratorium.^[122]

Exonerations from death row and executions of innocent prisoners[edit]

   Further information: Capital punishment debate in the United States §
   Wrongful execution

   According to the Death Penalty Information Center, since the
   reinstitution of the death penalty, 144 innocent prisoners have been
   exonerated from death row. (No. 144, Glenn Ford from Louisiana, was
   exonerated on March 11, 2014.) It is unknown how many of the people
   executed since 1976 may have been innocent, but some of them were
   executed despite considerable doubt about their guilt, such as Cameron
   Willingham (2004) and Troy Davis (2011). Statistics likely understate
   the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution
   has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep
   a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage
   of justice will ever be exposed. In the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell
   III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting
   attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results
   exonerated O'Dell, "it would be shouted from the rooftops that ...
   Virginia executed an innocent man." The state prevailed, and the
   evidence was destroyed.^[102]

Current moratoria and de facto moratoria[edit]

   Since the reinstatement of the death penalty, Kansas and New Hampshire
   have performed no executions, and four states have only executed
   volunteers: Pennsylvania has executed three inmates, Oregon two,
   Connecticut one, and New Mexico one. Therefore, these six states can be
   regarded as having de facto moratoria. In 2010, bills to abolish the
   death penalty in Kansas and in South Dakota (which had a de facto
   moratorium at the time) were rejected. Idaho ended its de facto
   moratorium, during which only one volunteer had been executed, on
   November 18, 2011 by executing Paul Ezra Rhoades; South Dakota executed
   Donald Moeller on October 30, 2012, ending a de facto moratorium during
   which only two volunteers had been executed. Of the 12 prisoners whom
   Nevada has executed since 1976, 11 wanted to die. Kentucky and Montana
   have executed two prisoners against their will (KY: 1997 and 1999, MT:
   1995 and 1998) and one volunteer, respectively (KY: 2008, MT: 2006).
   Colorado (in 1997) and Wyoming (in 1992) have executed only one
   prisoner, respectively.

   Democratic Governor Parris N. Glendening halted executions in the state
   of Maryland by executive order on May 9, 2002, but the subsequent
   Republican governor, Robert Ehrlich, resumed executions in 2004. On
   December 19, 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that state
   executions would be suspended until the manual that spells out the
   protocol for lethal injections is reviewed by a legislative panel. The
   state's Department of Corrections had adopted the manual without having
   a public hearing or submitting it before a committee. Legislative
   review of the protocol is required before approval under state law.

   In North Carolina, a de facto moratorium is in place following a
   decision by the state's medical board that physicians cannot
   participate in executions, which is a requirement under state and
   federal law.

   In California, United States District Judge Jeremy Fogel imposed a
   moratorium on the death penalty on December 15, 2006, ruling that the
   implementation used in California was unconstitutional but that it
   could be fixed.^[123]

   On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that the use of
   the electric chair is unconstitutional—specifically, that its use
   conflicts with the Nebraska Constitution. As electrocution was the only
   legally authorized method of execution in Nebraska, the state
   technically had no legal death penalty^[124] until the introduction of
   lethal injection in May 2009.^[125]

   After the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case Baze v.
   Rees, many states slowed or halted executions as lawyers for death-row
   inmates argued that states should not carry out executions using a
   method that may be ruled unconstitutional. While executions had come to
   an apparent stop until Baze was examined by the court, this was not the
   intent, according to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who stated
   on October 16, 2007 that stopping all executions by that method was not
   the high court's intention when it agreed to hear Baze. Just because
   the justices agreed to take on the case, Scalia said, does not
   necessarily mean that a moratorium should ensue.^[126] Justice Scalia's
   pronouncement was little more than an expression of his personal
   opinion as dicta made in a dissenting opinion of an unrelated case. As
   a dissenting opinion it did not, by definition, express the legal
   opinion of the majority of the court and has no precedential
   effect.^[127]

   On November 25, 2009, the Kentucky Supreme Court placed a moratorium on
   executions until the state adopts regulations for carrying out the
   penalty by lethal injection.^[128]

   In November 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium
   on executions in Oregon, canceling a planned execution and ordering a
   review of the death penalty system in the state.^[129]

   Pharmaceutical companies whose products are used in the three-drug
   cocktails for lethal injections are predominantly European, and they
   have strenuously objected to the use of their drugs for executions and
   taken steps to prevent their use.^[130] For example, Hospira, the sole
   American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, the critical anesthetic in
   the three-drug cocktail, announced in 2011 that it would no longer
   manufacture the drug for the American market, in part for ethical
   reasons and in part because its transfer of sodium thiopental
   manufacturing to Italy would subject it to the European Union's Torture
   Regulation, which forbids the use of any product manufactured within
   the Union for torture (as execution by lethal injection is considered
   by the Regulation).^[131] Since the drug manufacturers began taking
   these steps and the EU regulation ended the importation of drugs
   produced in Europe, the resulting shortage of execution drugs has led
   to or influenced decisions to impose moratoria in Arkansas, California,
   Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
   Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee.^[130]

   On June 22, 2012, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the state's
   lethal injection law violates the Arkansas Constitution, primarily on
   technical separation-of-powers grounds.^[132]^[133]

   On March 15, 2013, the Maryland House of Delegates voted 82-56 to
   repeal Maryland’s death penalty. It made the state the sixth in six
   years to abolish capital punishment.^[134]

   On February 11, 2014, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee announced a
   capital punishment moratorium. All death penalty cases that come to
   Inslee will result in him issuing a reprieve, not a pardon or
   commutation.

   In May 2014 Oklahoma director of corrections, Robert Patton,
   recommended an indefinite hold on executions in the state after the
   botched execution of African-American Clayton Lockett. The prisoner had
   to be tasered to restrain him prior to the execution and the lethal
   injection missed a vein in his groin, resulting in Lockett regaining
   consciousness, trying to get up and to speak, before dying of a heart
   attack 43 minutes later, after the attempted execution had been called
   off.^[135]

   On July 16, 2014, Federal Judge Cormac J. Carney of the United States
   District Court ruled that California's death penalty system is
   unconstitutional because it is arbitrary and plagued with delay.
