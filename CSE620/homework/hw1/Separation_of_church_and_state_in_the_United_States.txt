Separation of church and state in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   "Separation of church and state" (sometimes "wall of separation between
   church and state") is a phrase used by Thomas Jefferson and others
   expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the
   Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to
   the Constitution of the United States. The phrase has since been
   repeatedly used by the Supreme Court of the United States.

   The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that
   "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
   prohibiting the free exercise thereof ..." and Article VI specifies
   that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to
   any Office or public Trust under the United States." The modern concept
   of a wholly secular government is sometimes credited to the writings of
   English philosopher John Locke, but the phrase "separation of church
   and state" in this context is generally traced to a January 1, 1802
   letter by Thomas Jefferson, addressed to the Danbury Baptist
   Association in Connecticut, and published in a Massachusetts newspaper.

   Echoing the language of the founder of the first Baptist church in
   America, Roger Williams—who had written in 1644 of "[A] hedge or wall
   of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of
   the world"—Jefferson wrote, "I contemplate with sovereign reverence
   that act of the whole American people which declared that their
   legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of
   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a
   wall of separation between Church & State."^[1]

   Jefferson's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly
   by the U.S. Supreme Court. In Reynolds v. United States (1879) the
   Court wrote that Jefferson's comments "may be accepted almost as an
   authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First]
   Amendment." In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), Justice Hugo Black
   wrote: "In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against
   establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of
   separation between church and state."^[2]

   However, the Court has not always interpreted the constitutional
   principle as absolute, and the proper extent of separation between
   government and religion in the U.S. remains an ongoing subject of
   impassioned debate.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6]

Early history[edit]

   Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely,
   particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in
   France and Germany.^[7] They included nonconformists like the Puritans,
   as well as Catholics. Despite a common background, the groups' views on
   religious toleration were mixed. While some such as Roger Williams of
   Rhode Island and William Penn ensured the protection of religious
   minorities within their colonies, others like the Plymouth Colony and
   Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches. The Dutch colony of
   New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all
   other worship, though enforcement was sparse. Religious conformity was
   desired partly for financial reasons: the established Church was
   responsible for poverty relief, putting dissenting churches at a
   significant disadvantage.

Former state churches in British North America[edit]

Protestant colonies[edit]

     * The colony of Plymouth was founded by Pilgrims, English Dissenters
       or Separatists, Calvinists.
     * The colonies of Massachusetts Bay, New Haven, and New Hampshire
       were founded by Puritan, Calvinist, Protestants.
     * New Netherland was founded by Dutch Reformed Calvinists.
     * The colonies of New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
       and Georgia were officially Church of England.

Catholic colonies[edit]

     * When New France was transferred to Great Britain in 1763, the
       Catholic Church remained under toleration, but Huguenots were
       allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from
       settlement by Parisian authorities.
     * The Colony of Maryland was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to
       George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil,
       both recent converts to Catholicism. Under their leadership many
       English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the
       colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs,
       granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to
       avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions
       low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew
       the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary came to the
       English throne, they acceded to demands to revoke the original
       royal charter. In 1701 the Church of England was proclaimed, and in
       the course of the eighteenth century Maryland Catholics were first
       barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all
       of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property
       rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated
       in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics
       even continued to hold public office.
     * Spanish Florida was ceded to Great Britain in 1763, the British
       divided Florida into two colonies. Both East and West Florida
       continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic Residents.

Colonies with no established church[edit]

     * The Province of Pennsylvania was founded by Quakers, but the colony
       never had an established church.
     * West Jersey, also founded by Quakers, prohibited any establishment.
     * Delaware Colony
     * The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, founded by
       religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony,
       is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom
       to all its citizens.

   ^Note 1: In several colonies, the establishment ceased to exist in
   practice at the Revolution, about 1776;^[8] this is the date of
   permanent legal abolition.

   ^Note 2: in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows:
   "Article IV. Section 10. No person within this state shall, upon any
   pretense, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God
   in any manner agreeable to his own conscience, nor be compelled to
   attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor
   shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rate, for
   the building or repairing any place of worship, or for the maintenance
   of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right,
   or hath voluntarily engaged to do. No one religious society shall ever
   be established in this state, in preference to another; nor shall any
   person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of
   his religious principles."

   ^Note 3: From 1780 Massachusetts had a system which required every man
   to belong to a church, and permitted each church to tax its members,
   but forbade any law requiring that it be of any particular
   denomination. This was objected to, as in practice establishing the
   Congregational Church, the majority denomination, and was abolished in
   1833.

   ^Note 4: Until 1877 the New Hampshire Constitution required members of
   the State legislature to be of the Protestant religion.

   ^Note 5: The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the
   Anglican church, but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only
   Protestants to hold public office. From 1835-1876 it allowed only
   Christians (including Catholics) to hold public office. Article VI,
   Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from
   holding public office.^[9] Such clauses were held by the United States
   Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v.
   Watkins, when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted
   a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment
   protections.

   ^Note 6: Religious tolerance for Catholics with an established Church
   of England was policy in the former Spanish Colonies of East and West
   Florida while under British rule.

   ^Note 7: In Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended the American
   Revolutionary War, the British ceded both East and West Florida back to
   Spain (see Spanish Florida).

   ^Note 8: Tithes for the support of the Anglican Church in Virginia were
   suspended in 1776, and never restored. 1786 is the date of the Virginia
   Statute of Religious Freedom, which prohibited any coercion to support
   any religious body.

Colonial support for separation[edit]

   The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and
   state as early as the mid-17th century. The document was signed
   December 27, 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were
   affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the
   Governor of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant had formally
   banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being
   practiced in the colony, in accordance with the laws of the Dutch
   Republic. The signers indicated their "desire therefore in this case
   not to judge lest we be judged, neither to condemn least we be
   condemned, but rather let every man stand or fall to his own
   Master."^[10] Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison
   until they recanted. However, John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in
   his home. Bowne was arrested, jailed, and sent to the Netherlands for
   trial; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne.

   New York Historical Society President and Columbia University Professor
   of History Kenneth T. Jackson describes the Flushing Remonstrance as
   "the first thing that we have in writing in the United States where a
   group of citizens attests on paper and over their signature the right
   of the people to follow their own conscience with regard to God - and
   the inability of government, or the illegality of government, to
   interfere with that."^[11]

   Given the wide diversity of opinion on Christian theological matters in
   the newly independent American States, the Constitutional Convention
   believed a government sanctioned (established) religion would disrupt
   rather than bind the newly formed union together. George Washington
   wrote a letter in 1790 to the country's first Jewish congregation, the
   Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island to state:

     "Allowing rights and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more
     that toleration is spoken of, as if it were by the indulgence of one
     class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent
     natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States,
     which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance
     requires only that they who live under its protection should demean
     themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their
     effectual support."^[12]

   There were also opponents to the support of any established church even
   at the state level. In 1773, Isaac Backus, a prominent Baptist minister
   in New England, observed that when "church and state are separate, the
   effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other:
   but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can
   fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued." Thomas Jefferson's
   influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786,
   five years before the Bill of Rights.

   Most Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans, were Loyalists. The
   Anglican establishment, where it had existed, largely ceased to
   function during the American Revolution, though the new States did not
   formally abolish and replace it until some years after the Revolution.

Jefferson, Madison, and the "wall of separation"[edit]

   The phrase "[A] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the
   church and the wilderness of the world" was first used by Baptist
   theologian Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island,
   in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution.^[13]^[14] The phrase
   was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First
   Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal
   government, in an 1802 letter^[15] to the Danbury Baptists (a religious
   minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist
   church in Connecticut):

     Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely
     between man and his god, that he owes account to none other for his
     faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach
     actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign
     reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that
     their "legislature" should "make no law respecting an establishment
     of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus
     building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to
     this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the
     rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the
     progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his
     natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to
     his social duties.

   Jefferson's letter was in reply to a letter^[16] that he had received
   from the Danbury Baptist Association dated October 7, 1801. In an 1808
   letter to Virginia Baptists, Jefferson would use the same theme:

     We have solved, by fair experiment, the great and interesting
     question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in
     government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the
     quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to
     profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the
     inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own
     inquiries.

   Jefferson and James Madison's conceptions of separation have long been
   debated. Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent
   to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a
   Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia.^[17]^[18]
   Madison issued four religious proclamations while President,^[19] but
   vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.^[20]
   On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious
   services at the Capitol.^[21] Years before the ratification of the
   Constitution, Madison contended "Because if Religion be exempt from the
   authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that
   of the Legislative Body."^[22] After retiring from the presidency,
   Madison wrote of "total separation of the church from the state."^[23]
   "Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the
   Constitution of the United States," Madison wrote,^[24] and he
   declared, "practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government
   is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the
   Constitution of the United States."^[25] In a letter to Edward
   Livingston Madison further expanded, "We are teaching the world the
   great truth that Govts. do better without Kings & Nobles than with
   them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion
   flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt."^[26]
   Madison's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions
   binding the States, as well as the Federal Government, from an
   establishment of religion, but the House did not pass them.^[citation
   needed]

   Jefferson's opponents said his position was the destruction and the
   governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature.^[27]
   In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the
   separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a
   constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity,
   arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.^[28] Some
   have argued that this arrangement was "fully compatible with
   Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;"^[29] however,
   others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at
   the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence
   that his views were not consistent with strict separation.^[30] Still
   other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole
   issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on
   this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other
   relevant history^[31]

   Jefferson's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon
   polygamy case Reynolds v. U.S., in which the court cited Jefferson and
   Madison, seeking a legal definition for the word religion. Writing for
   the majority, Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson's Letter to
   the Danbury Baptists to state that "Congress was deprived of all
   legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions
   which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good
   order."^[32] Considering this, the court ruled that outlawing polygamy
   was constitutional.

Patrick Henry, Massachusetts, and Connecticut[edit]

   Jefferson and Madison's approach was not the only one taken in the
   eighteenth century. Jefferson's Statute of Religious Freedom was
   drafted in opposition to a bill, chiefly supported by Patrick Henry,
   which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination, but
   which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to
   support it. Similarly, the Constitution of Massachusetts originally
   provided that "no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in
   his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and
   season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience... provided
   he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their
   religious worship," (Article II) but also that:

     the people of this commonwealth have a right to invest their
     legislature with power to authorize and require, and the legislature
     shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several towns,
     parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic, or religious
     societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expense, for the
     institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and
     maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion and
     morality, in all cases where such provision shall not be made
     voluntarily. And the people of this commonwealth have also a right
     to, and do, invest their legislature with authority to enjoin upon
     all the subjects an attendance upon the instructions of the public
     teachers aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any on
     whose instructions they can conscientiously and conveniently attend.
     (Article III)

   Since, in practice, this meant that the decision of who was taxable for
   a particular religion rested in the hands of the selectmen, usually
   Congregationalists, this system was open to abuse. It was abolished in
   1833. The intervening period is sometimes referred to as an
   "establishment of religion" in Massachusetts.

   The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of
   New York and New Jersey support some church, but this was more often
   Dutch Reformed, Quaker or Presbyterian, than Anglican. Some chose to
   support more than one church. He also ordained that the tax-payers were
   free, having paid his local tax, to choose their own church. The terms
   for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would
   have liberty of conscience, and the Duke, as an openly divine-right
   Catholic, was no friend of Anglicanism. The first Anglican minister in
   New Jersey arrived in 1698, though Anglicanism was more popular in New
   York.^[33]

   Connecticut had a real establishment of religion. Its citizens did not
   adopt a constitution at the Revolution, but rather amended their
   Charter to remove all references to the British Government. As a
   result, the Congregational Church continued to be established, and Yale
   College, at that time a Congregational institution, received grants
   from the State until Connecticut adopted a constitution in 1818 partly
   because of this issue.

Test acts[edit]

   The absence of an establishment of religion did not necessarily imply
   that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a Test Act,
   and several states retained them for a short time. This stood in
   contrast to the Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the
   employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through
   the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.

   For example, the New Jersey Constitution of 1776 provides liberty of
   conscience in much the same language as Massachusetts (similarly
   forbidding payment of "taxes, tithes or other payments" contrary to
   conscience). It then provides:

     That there shall be no establishment of any one religious sect in
     this Province, in preference to another; and that no Protestant
     inhabitant of this Colony shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil
     right, merely on account of his religious principles; but that all
     persons, professing a belief in the faith of any Protestant sect,
     who shall demean themselves peaceably under the government, as
     hereby established, shall be capable of being elected into any
     office of profit or trust, or being a member of either branch of the
     Legislature, and shall fully and freely enjoy every privilege and
     immunity, enjoyed by others their fellow subjects.^[34]

   This would permit a Test Act, but did not require one.

   The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted
   membership in the Assembly to Christians; the Duke of York was
   fervently Catholic, and the proprietors of Perth Amboy, New Jersey were
   Scottish Catholic peers. The Province of West Jersey had declared, in
   1681, that there should be no religious test for office. An oath had
   also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War
   requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope, which may or may
   not have been applied during the Revolution. That law was replaced by
   1799.

   The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 provided:

     And each member, before he takes his seat, shall make and subscribe
     the following declaration, viz:

          I do believe in one God, the creator and governor of the
          universe, the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the
          wicked. And I do acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New
          Testament to be given by Divine inspiration.

     And no further or other religious test shall ever hereafter be
     required of any civil officer or magistrate in this State.

   Again, it provided in general that all tax-paying freemen and their
   sons shall be able to vote, and that no "man, who acknowledges the
   being of a God, be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a
   citizen, on account of his religious sentiments or peculiar mode of
   religious worship."

The US Constitution[edit]

Article 6[edit]

   Article Six of the United States Constitution provides that "no
   religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office
   or public Trust under the United States". Prior to the adoption of the
   Bill of Rights, this was the only mention of religion in the
   Constitution.

The First Amendment[edit]

   The first amendment to the US Constitution states "Congress shall make
   no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
   exercise thereof" The two parts, known as the "establishment clause"
   and the "free exercise clause" respectively, form the textual basis for
   the Supreme Court's interpretations of the "separation of church and
   state" doctrine.^[35]

   The First Congress' deliberations show that its understanding of the
   separation of church and state differed sharply from that of their
   contemporaries in Europe.^[citation needed] As 19th century Union
   Theological Seminary historian Philip Schaff observed:

     "The American separation of church and state rests upon respect for
     the church; the [European anticlerical] separation, on indifference
     and hatred of the church, and of religion itself…. The constitution
     did not create a nation, nor its religion and institutions. It found
     them already existing, and was framed for the purpose of protecting
     them under a republican form of government, in a rule of the people,
     by the people, and for the people."^[citation needed]

   An August 15, 1789 entry in Madison's papers indicates he intended for
   the establishment clause to prevent the government imposition of
   religious beliefs on individuals. The entry says: "Mr. Madison said he
   apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not
   establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law,
   nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their
   conscience. ..."^[36]

   Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of LSU, theorize that Madison's
   initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding
   the establishment of a "national religion"—was rejected by the House,
   in favor of the more general "religion" in an effort to appease the
   Anti-Federalists. To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the
   very word "national" was a cause for alarm because of the experience
   under the British crown.^[37] During the debate over the establishment
   clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's
   language regarding whether the government was a national or federal
   government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty),
   which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from
   the debate.

   Following the argument between Madison and Gerry, Rep. Samuel Livermore
   of New Hampshire proposed language stating that, "Congress shall make
   no laws touching religion or the rights of conscience." This raised an
   uproar from members, such as Rep. Benjamin Huntingdon of Connecticut
   and Rep. Peter Sylvester of New York, who worried the language could be
   used to harm religious practice.

   Others, such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut, believed the clause
   was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress
   stated powers, which did not include establishing a national religion.
   Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to
   strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the
   religious clauses in the state constitutions. However, the
   Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of
   Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment.

   The Senate went through several more narrowly targeted versions before
   reaching the contemporary language. One version read, "Congress shall
   make no law establishing one religious sect or society in preference to
   others, nor shall freedom of conscience be infringed," while another
   read, "Congress shall make no law establishing one particular religious
   denomination in preference to others." Ultimately, the Senate rejected
   the more narrowly targeted language.

   At the time of the passage of the Bill of Rights, many states acted in
   ways that would now be held unconstitutional. All of the early official
   state churches were disestablished by 1833 (Massachusetts), including
   the Congregationalist establishment in Connecticut. It is commonly
   accepted that, under the doctrine of Incorporation—which uses the Due
   Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to hold the Bill of Rights
   applicable to the states—these state churches could not be
   reestablished today.

The 14th Amendment[edit]

   The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Amendment
   XIV) is one of the post-Civil War amendments, intended to secure rights
   for former slaves. It includes the due process and equal protection
   clauses among others. The amendment introduces the concept of
   incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states. While
   it has not been fully implemented, the doctrine of incorporation has
   been used to ensure, through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and
   Immunities Clause, the application of most of the rights enumerated in
   the Bill of Rights to the states.

   The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the
   landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the
   subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in
   regard to the state governments.^[38] Although upholding the state law
   in that case, which provided for public busing to private religious
   schools, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment
   clause was fully applicable to the state governments. A more recent
   case involving the application of this principle against the states was
   Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet
   (1994).

The "Separation" principle and the Supreme Court[edit]

   Jefferson's concept of "separation of church and state" first became a
   part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S., 98 U.S.
   145 (1878).^[39] In that case, the court examined the history of
   religious liberty in the US, determining that while the constitution
   guarantees religious freedom, "The word 'religion' is not defined in
   the Constitution. We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain its
   meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history
   of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted." The
   court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the
   constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and
   Thomas Jefferson. Quoting the "separation" paragraph from Jefferson's
   letter to the Danbury Baptists, the court concluded that, "coming as
   this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure,
   it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope
   and effect of the amendment thus secured."

   The centrality of the "separation" concept to the Religion Clauses of
   the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education,
   330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed
   government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public
   and Catholic schools. This was the first case in which the court
   applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state, having
   interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as
   applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal
   legislature. Citing Jefferson, the court concluded that "The First
   Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall must
   be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest
   breach."

   While the decision (with four dissents) ultimately upheld the state law
   allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious
   schools, the majority opinion (by Justice Hugo Black) and the
   dissenting opinions (by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge and Justice
   Robert H. Jackson) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has
   erected a "wall between church and state" or a "separation of Church
   from State": their disagreement was limited to whether this case of
   state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that
   wall. Rutledge, on behalf of the four dissenting justices, took the
   position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall
   of separation in this case: "Neither so high nor so impregnable today
   as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia's
   great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment, now made
   applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth." Writing separately,
   Justice Jackson argued that "[T]here are no good grounds upon which to
   support the present legislation. In fact, the undertones of the
   opinion, advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church
   from State, seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding
   support to their commingling in educational matters."

   In 1962, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of officially-sponsored
   prayer or religious recitations in public schools. In Engel v. Vitale,
   370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court, by a vote of 6-1, determined it
   unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school
   prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when the
   prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from
   participation. (The prayer required by the New York State Board of
   Regents prior to the Court's decision consisted of: "Almighty God, we
   acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us,
   our parents, our teachers, and our country. Amen.") As the Court
   stated:

     The petitioners contend, among other things, that the state laws
     requiring or permitting use of the Regents' prayer must be struck
     down as a violation of the Establishment Clause because that prayer
     was composed by governmental officials as a part of a governmental
     program to further religious beliefs. For this reason, petitioners
     argue, the State's use of the Regents' prayer in its public school
     system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church
     and State. We agree with that contention, since we think that the
     constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment
     of religion must at least mean that, in this country, it is no part
     of the business of government to compose official prayers for any
     group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious
     program carried on by government.

   The court noted that it "is a matter of history that this very practice
   of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services
   was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to
   leave England and seek religious freedom in America."^[40] The lone
   dissenter, Justice Potter Stewart, objected to the court's embrace of
   the "wall of separation" metaphor: "I think that the Court's task, in
   this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication, is not responsibly
   aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the "wall of
   separation," a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution."

   In Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), the Supreme Court
   considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime "to teach the theory or
   doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of
   animals," or "to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that
   teaches" this theory in any school or university that received public
   funds. The court's opinion, written by Justice Abe Fortas, ruled that
   the Arkansas law violated "the constitutional prohibition of state laws
   respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
   exercise thereof. The overriding fact is that Arkansas' law selects
   from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for
   the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular
   religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the
   Book of Genesis by a particular religious group." The court held that
   the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any
   religion, and that "[T]he state has no legitimate interest in
   protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them." ^[41]
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

   Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state
   must therefore answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system
   that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly?
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in her opinion on the 2005 Ten
   Commandments ruling.^[42]

   In Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the court determined that a
   Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs
   of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated
   the Establishment Clause. The court's decision argued that the
   separation of church and state could never be absolute: "Our prior
   holdings do not call for total separation between church and state;
   total separation is not possible in an absolute sense. Some
   relationship between government and religious organizations is
   inevitable," the court wrote. "Judicial caveats against entanglement
   must recognize that the line of separation, far from being a "wall," is
   a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on all the
   circumstances of a particular relationship."

   Subsequent to this decision, the Supreme Court has applied a
   three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with
   the Establishment Clause, known as the "Lemon Test". First, the law or
   policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose.
   Second, the principle or primary effect must be one that neither
   advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute or policy must not
   result in an "excessive entanglement" of government with religion.^[43]
   (The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the
   government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic
   schools, and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the
   Catholic Church's religious mission, thus the policy involved the state
   in an "excessive entanglement" with religion.) Failure to meet any of
   these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question
   violates the Establishment Clause.

   In 2002, a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held
   that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California
   public school was unconstitutional, even when students were not
   compelled to recite it, due to the inclusion of the phrase "under God."
   In reaction to the case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow,
   both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for
   the pledge, and condemning the panel's ruling.^[44] The case was
   appealed to the Supreme Court, where the case was ultimately overturned
   in June 2004, solely on procedural grounds not related to the
   substantive constitutional issue. Rather, a five-justice majority held
   that Newdow, a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter,
   lacked standing to sue.

   When the Louisiana state legislature passed a law requiring public
   school biology teachers to give Creationism and Evolution equal time in
   the classroom, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was
   unconstitutional because it was intended to advance a particular
   religion, and did not serve the secular purpose of improved scientific
   education.^[45] (See also: Creation and evolution in public education)

   The display of the Ten Commandments as part of courthouse displays was
   considered in a group of cases decided in summer of 2005, including
   McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky and Van Orden v. Perry. While
   parties on both sides hoped for a reformulation or clarification of the
   Lemon test, the two rulings ended with narrow 5–4 and opposing
   decisions,^[vague] with Justice Stephen Breyer the swing vote.

   On December 20, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
   Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued
   display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American
   legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed, because the
   purpose of the display (educating the public on American legal
   traditions) was secular in nature.^[46] In ruling on the Mount Soledad
   cross controversy on May 3, 2006, however, a federal judge ruled that
   the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed.^[47]

   In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway, 12-696, the
   Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town
   meetings, which are allowed, must allow various faiths to lead prayer,
   or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian.^[48] On May 5,
   2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece
   by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at
   government meetings, but also for sectarian prayers like predominately
   Christian prayers.^[49]

The Treaty of Tripoli[edit]

   Main article: Treaty of Tripoli

   In 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that
   stated in Article 11:

     As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any
     sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no
     character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of
     Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or
     act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the
     parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever
     produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two
     countries.^[50]

Interpretive controversies[edit]

   Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of "separation
   of church and state", or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the
   constitutional limitation on religious establishment.^[51] Such critics
   generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements
   of the Constitution, while noting that many aspects of church and state
   were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified. These
   critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and
   state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers. Some
   of the intermingling between church and state include religious
   references in official contexts, and such other founding documents as
   the United States Declaration of Independence, which references the
   idea of a "Creator" and "Nature's God", though these references did not
   ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any
   particular religious view of a "Creator" or "Nature's God."

   These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note
   the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the
   time of ratification, to suggest that the modern incorporation of the
   Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original
   constitutional intent.^[citation needed] The issue is complex, however,
   as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th
   Amendment in 1868, at which point the first amendment's application to
   the state government was recognized.^[52] Many of these constitutional
   debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism
   versus modern, progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the
   Living Constitution. Other debates center on the principle of the law
   of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution's
   Supremacy Clause, but also by legal precedence, making an accurate
   reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given
   era, and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant
   when discussing the Constitution.

   The "religious test" clause has been interpreted to cover both elected
   officials and appointed ones, career civil servants as well as
   political appointees. Religious beliefs or the lack of them have
   therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to
   federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution. Seven
   states, however, have language included in their Bill of Rights,
   Declaration of Rights, or in the body of their constitutions that
   require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs,
   though some of these have been successfully challenged in court.^[53]
   These states are Texas, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina,
   Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee.^[54]

   The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being
   and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments. (Tennessee
   Constitution Article IX, Section 2 is one such example.) Some of these
   same states specify that the oath of office include the words "so help
   me God." In some cases these beliefs (or oaths) were historically
   required of jurors and witnesses in court. At one time, such
   restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states' rights; today
   they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment, as
   applied to the states via the 14th amendment, and hence
   unconstitutional and unenforceable.

   While sometimes questioned as possible violations of separation, the
   appointment of official chaplains for government functions, voluntary
   prayer meetings at the Department of Justice outside of duty hours,
   voluntary prayer at meals in U.S. armed forces, inclusion of the
   (optional) phrase "so help me God" in the oaths for many elected
   offices, FBI agents, etc., have been held not to violate the First
   Amendment, since they fall within the realm of free exercise of
   religion.^[citation needed]

   Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches, the
   tax-free status of church property, the fact that Christmas is a
   federal holiday, etc., have also been questioned, but have been
   considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding
   practical and beneficial arrangements for the society. The national
   motto "In God We Trust" has been challenged as a violation, but the
   Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in
   nature.

   Jeffries and Ryan (2001) argue that the modern concept of separation of
   church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the
   Supreme Court. The central point, they argue, was a constitutional ban
   against aid to religious schools, followed by a later ban on religious
   observance in public education. Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two
   propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and
   that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist
   position of the modern Establishment Clause.

   Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a
   coalition of separationist opinion. Most important was "the pervasive
   secularism that came to dominate American public life," which sought to
   confine religion to a private sphere. Further, the ban against
   government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most
   Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools,
   which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however,
   anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and
   the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has
   collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined
   towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion
   has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict
   separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths,
   even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.^[citation
   needed]

   Critics of the modern concept of the "separation of church and state"
   argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution
   and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers
   understood it. Philip Hamburger, Columbia Law school professor and
   prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept, maintains
   that the modern concept, which deviates from the constitutional
   establishment clause jurisprudence, is rooted in American
   anti-Catholicism and Nativism.^[citation needed] Briefs before the
   Supreme Court, including by the U.S. government, have argued that some
   state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of
   separation of church and state (Blaine Amendments) were motivated by
   and intended to enact anti-Catholicism.^[55]

   J. Brent Walker, Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee,
   responded to Hamburger's claims noting; "The fact that the separation
   of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an
   anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity
   of the principle. Champions of religious liberty have argued for the
   separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with
   anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture. Of course,
   separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to
   tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue
   for on-campus released time in the public schools. But that principled
   debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious
   bigotry"^[56]

   Steven Waldman notes that; "The evangelicals provided the political
   muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson, not merely because
   they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep
   the spiritual and secular worlds apart." "Religious freedom resulted
   from an alliance of unlikely partners," writes the historian Frank
   Lambert in his book The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in
   America. "New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland
   joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas
   Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state."^[57]

Politics and religion in the United States[edit]

   Robert N. Bellah has argued in his writings that although the
   separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution
   of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious
   dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the
   term "Civil Religion" to describe the specific relation between
   politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes
   the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy: "Considering the separation of
   church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God'
   at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not
   denied the political realm a religious dimension."^[58]

   Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the
   world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or
   state-established church—is good for both the church and the state,
   allowing a variety of religions to flourish.^[59] Speaking at the
   Toronto-based Center for New Religions, Wood said that the freedom of
   conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a
   "remarkable religiosity" in the United States that isn't present in
   other industrialized nations.^[59] Wood believes that the U.S. operates
   on "a sort of civic religion," which includes a generally-shared belief
   in a creator who "expects better of us." Beyond that, individuals are
   free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds
   and express their conscience. He calls this approach the "genius of
   religious sentiment in the United States."^[59]
