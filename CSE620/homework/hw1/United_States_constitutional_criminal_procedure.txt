   The Warren Court (1953–1969) issued several landmark constitutional
   decisions concerning criminal procedure, including Gideon v. Wainwright
   (1963), Brady v. Maryland (1963), and Duncan v. Louisiana (1968).

   The United States Constitution contains several provisions regarding
   the law of criminal procedure.

   Petit jury and venue provisions—both traceable to enumerated complaints
   in the Declaration of Independence—are included in Article Three of the
   United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions are
   contained in the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth,
   Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With the exception of the Grand Jury
   Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth
   Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth
   Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of
   Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.

   Several of these rights regulate pre-trial procedure: access to a
   non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, the right
   to an information (charging document), the right to a speedy trial, and
   the right to be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are
   trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses
   at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a
   public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected
   from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to testify
   against oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due
   process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.

   If a defendant is convicted, the usual remedy for a violation of one of
   these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the
   defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as
   the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to
   harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a
   reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy
   Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the
   defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
   Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all
   reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.

   The U.S. Bill of Rights

   Article Three, Section Two, Clause Three of the United States
   Constitution provides that:

          Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by
          Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said
          Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within
          any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the
          Congress may by Law have directed.^[1]

   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in
   relevant part, that:

          No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
          infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand
          Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in
          the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public
          danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to
          be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled
          in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
          deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
          law . . . .^[2]

   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State
          and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which
          district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to
          be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be
          confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory
          process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the
          Assistance of Counsel for his defence.^[3]

   The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in
   relevant part, that:

          Excessive bail shall not be required . . . .^[4]

   The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in
   relevant part, that:

          [N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
          property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person
          within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.^[5]

History[edit]

   The Supreme Court of the United States issued almost no constitutional
   criminal procedure decisions for its first century of existence.
   Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the
   Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal
   constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation
   of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment.^[6] Second, the
   Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases
   until 1891.^[7]

   The Marshall Court possessed jurisdiction in criminal cases only via
   writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and
   certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases
   involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues
   of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy
   Clause.^[8] Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail
   required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the
   Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.^[9]

   In two appeals from state courts, the Taney Court considered, and
   rejected, double jeopardy claims arising from the hypothetical prospect
   of prosecution by the federal and state governments for the same
   conduct.^[10]

   The first Supreme Court decisions to reverse state criminal convictions
   for constitutional procedural reasons involved the exclusion of
   African-Americans for grand and petit juries—Strauder v. West Virginia
   (1880), Virginia v. Rives (1880), Neal v. Delaware (1881), Carter v.
   Texas (1900), Rogers v. Alabama (1904), and Norris v. Alabama
   (1935)—and the conviction African-American defendants for crimes
   involving white victims in the southern states: by a mob-dominated
   trial, as in Moore v. Dempsey (1923); and without counsel, as in Powell
   v. Alabama (1932).^[11]

Pre-trial procedure[edit]

Bail[edit]

   Main article: Excessive Bail Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. VIII provides:

          Excessive bail shall not be required . . . .^[4]

   Stack v. Boyle (1951) is the only case in which the Supreme Court has
   held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally excessive. There,
   the Court found $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk
   for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act.^[12] In United
   States v. Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984,
   which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the
   determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.^[13]

   The incorporation status of the Excessive Bail Clause is unclear. In
   Schilb v. Kuebel (1971), the Court stated in dicta: "Bail, of course,
   is basic to our system of law, and the Eighth Amendment's proscription
   of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States
   through the Fourteenth Amendment."^[14] In Murphy v. Hunt (1982), the
   Court did not reach the issue because the case was dismissed as
   moot.^[15] Bail was included in the list of incorporated rights in
   McDonald v. Chicago (2010), citing Schilb.^[16]

Grand Jury[edit]

   Further information: Grand juries in the United States
   A grand jury in 1913

   U.S. Const. amend. V provides:

          No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
          infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand
          Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in
          the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public
          danger . . . .^[3]

   The Grand Jury Clause applies only to capital and "otherwise infamous"
   crimes. Any crime "punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary" is
   infamous.^[17] Only those convicted of felonies, i.e. crimes punishable
   by greater than one year of imprisonment, are confined to a
   penitentiary. Any crime punishable by hard labor, regardless of the
   term or place of imprisonment, is also infamous.^[18] Contempt of
   court, even if punished by greater than one year imprisonment, is not
   infamous.^[19] In Hurtado v. California (1884), the Supreme Court held
   that the Grand Jury Clause was not incorporated to apply to the states
   by the Fourteenth Amendment.^[20]

   If the grand jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime
   must be submitted to the grand jury.^[21] Thus, the prosecution cannot
   augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury.^[22] But, the
   government may narrow the indictment without so returning.^[23]

   The Grand Jury Clause does very little, if anything, to regulate the
   procedures of the grand jury. For example, the Clause does not prohibit
   a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence.^[24]
   Non-fundamental flaws with the grand jury, such as a violation of the
   defendant's self-incrimination rights^[25] or a violation of grand jury
   secrecy^[26] do not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States
   v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have
   required "substantial exculpatory evidence" to be presented to the
   grand jury, the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment
   violation.^[27] The lack of a grand jury does not deprive the court of
   jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the grand jury right.^[28]

Information[edit]

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation .
          . . .^[3]

   A charging instrument is constitutionally sufficient under this clause
   (and under the Grand Jury Clause) if it (1) "contains the elements of
   the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the
   defendant of what he must be prepared to meet," and (2) "shows with
   accuracy to what extent he may plead" double jeopardy in a subsequent
   prosecution.^[29] This right has been incorporated.^[30]

   In a case submitted to a grand jury, the indictment must satisfy this
   requirement. In cases not required to be submitted to a grand jury, the
   formal charging instrument is referred to as an "information" (in the
   federal system and in some states) or a "complaint."

Speedy trial[edit]

   Main article: Speedy Trial Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          to a speedy . . . trial . . . .^[3]

   The Speedy Trial Clause regulates delay between the bringing of a
   formal criminal charge and/or the pre-trial deprivation of the
   accused's liberty and the start of trial.^[31] The Clause has been
   incorporated to apply in state prosecutions.^[32]

   In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court announced four factors
   relevant to the determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation: (1)
   the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the
   defendant demanded a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice.^[33] Applying
   Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States
   (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and
   arrest.^[34] The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause
   violation is dismissal with prejudice.^[35]

Venue[edit]

   The Declaration of Independence accused King George III of
   "transporting us beyond Seas to be tried"^[36]
   Further information: Venue (law)

   U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 3 provides:

          Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the
          said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed
          within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as
          the Congress may by Law have directed.^[1]

   The perceived abuse of English criminal venue law was one of the
   enumerated grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence,
   which accused George III of the United Kingdom of "transporting us
   beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses."^[36]

   The "where the said Crimes shall have been committed" language refers
   to the locus delicti. "[T]he locus delicti must be determined from the
   nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts
   constituting it."^[37] Thus, a single crime may often give rise to
   several constitutionally permissible venues, and venue may be
   constitutionally permissible even if an individual defendant was never
   personally present in the relevant state.^[38] For example, conspiracy
   may be prosecuted wherever the agreement occurred or wherever any overt
   act was committed.^[39]

   For the purposes of constitutional venue, the boundaries of the states
   are questions of law to be determined by the judge, but the location of
   the crime is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.^[40]

   The venue provision of Article III (regulating the location of the
   trial) is distinct from the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment
   (regulating the geography from which the jury pool is selected). The
   unit of the former is the state; the unit of the later is the state and
   judicial district. Unlike judicial districts under the Vicinage Clause,
   consistent with Article III, Congress may "provide a place of trial
   where none was provided when the offense was committed, or change the
   place of trial after the commission of the offense."^[41]

Trial procedure[edit]

Compulsory process[edit]

   Main article: Compulsory Process Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his
          favor . . . .^[3]

   The Compulsory Process Clause guarantees the defendant the right to
   obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, the Clause prevents a
   jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants
   as witnesses.^[42] Similarly, the Clause prevents the government from
   deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and
   favorable to the defense.^[43] The right is does not pre-empt
   reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the
   preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.^[44]

Confrontation[edit]

   Main article: Confrontation Clause
   Crawford v. Washington (2004) referred to Sir Walter Raleigh's
   (pictured) inability to cross-examine Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham
   as one of the "most notorious instances of civil-law examination."^[45]

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . .
          .^[3]

   In Crawford v. Washington (2004), the Supreme Court held that the
   Confrontation Clause bars the "admission of testimonial statements of a
   witness who did not appear at trial" unless pursuant to one of the
   "exceptions established at the time of the founding."^[46] "[W]hen the
   declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation
   Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial
   statements . . . so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend
   or explain it."^[47] In Davis v. Washington (2006), the Court held that
   the Clause places no restrictions on nontestimonial statements.^[48]

   Crawford did not completely define the term "testimonial."^[49] But,
   Crawford held that, "[w]hatever else the term covers, it applies at a
   minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand
   jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations."^[50]
   Laboratory reports of forensic tests are also testimonial, conferring
   on the defendant a right to cross-examine the analyst who certifies
   them.^[51]

   Statements made during police interrogation are nontestimonial if
   circumstances objectively indicate "that the primary purpose of the
   interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing
   emergency" but are tesitmonial if circumstances objective indicate
   "that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose
   of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially
   relevant to later criminal prosecution."^[52] "[T]he relevant inquiry
   is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in
   a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable
   participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals'
   statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter
   occurred."^[53]

   One exception established at the founding is if the witness is
   "unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity
   for cross-examination."^[54] Another such exception is "forfeiture by
   wrongdoing," i.e. where the defendant intends to obtain and obtains the
   absence of the witness by wrongdoing.^[55] Still another exception is
   "the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing
   the truth of the matter asserted."^[47] Another possible exception is
   for dying declarations, i.e. statements made by a speaker on the brink
   of death while aware that he or she is dying.^[56]

Petit jury, impartiality, and vicinage[edit]

   Further information: Juries in the United States#Petit jury
   An empty jury box

   U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 3 provides:

          Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by
          Jury . . . .^[1]

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          to a . . . trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district
          wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district
          shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . .^[3]

   One of the enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence
   accused King George III of "depriving us, in many Cases, of the
   Benefits of Trial by Jury."^[36]

   Availability

   Depending on the authorized and actual sentence, upon demand, a
   criminal defendant has a right to trial by jury. The defendant does not
   have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the
   prosecution.^[57] If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the
   authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal
   court, the defendant has a right to a jury.^[58] Further, the defendant
   has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six
   months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g.
   contempt of court).^[59]

   But, the defendant does not have a right to a jury in stacked
   misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized
   imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does
   not.^[60] Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be
   relevant to seriousness, but so far the Court has pushed back against
   expanding the jury right.^[61]

   Impartiality

   The trial judge has an obligation to ensure an impartial jury,
   especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as
   jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury
   sequestration, and jury instructions.^[62] For example, this may
   require the court to permit voir dire on the subject of the juror's
   potential racial prejudice.^[63] In some circumstances, the Sixth
   Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change
   of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.^[64]

   The Sixth Amendment also regulates the availability and use of cause
   and peremptory challenges. For example, it precludes a jurisdiction
   from granting the prosecution for-cause removal of jurors who oppose
   the death penalty.^[65] "The most that can be demanded of a venireman
   in this regard is that he be willing to consider all of the penalties
   provided by state law, and that he not be irrevocably committed, before
   the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of
   the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the
   proceedings."^[66] While a defendant is not obliged to use peremptory
   challenges to cure a trial court's erroneous denial of a defendant's
   for-cause challenge, if the defendant does so, the defendant may not
   rely on the error for automatic reversal.^[67]

   Size and unanimity

   The Supreme Court has held that six-member juries are sufficient^[68]
   and that five-member juries are not.^[69] Verdict unanimity is not
   required for twelve-member juries,^[70] but is required for six-member
   juries.^[71]

   Vicinage

   Main article: Vicinage Clause

   The provision requiring that the jury be drawn "of the State and
   district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district
   shall have been previously ascertained by law" is known as the Vicinage
   Clause. The Vicinage Clause places no limits on the prosecution of
   crimes not committed within a state.^[72] Nor does the Clause prevent a
   crime from being tried by a jury from a different division (a subset of
   a federal judicial district) within the same district in which the
   crime was committed.^[73] The Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have
   held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states
   by the Fourteenth Amendment.^[74]

Public trial[edit]

   Further information: Public trial
   A courtroom sketch, a common component of media coverage of trials

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          to a . . . public trial . . . .^[3]

   The defendant has a right to have the courtroom open to the public,
   absent a showing of a substantial government interest that cannot be
   addressed by alternatives other than closure. The right to a public
   trial extends to pre-trial matters such as a suppression hearing^[75]
   and jury selection.^[76] The Public Trial Clause has its roots in the
   "traditional Anglo-American distrust for secret trials has been
   variously ascribed to the notorious use of this practice by the Spanish
   Inquisition, to the excesses of the English Court of Star Chamber, and
   to the French monarchy's abuse of the lettre de cachet."^[77]

   The Sixth Amendment public trial right is held by the defendant, and
   the excluded public have no ability to assert it.^[78] Independently,
   however, the public has a substantially similar First Amendment right
   to attend.^[79]

Self-incrimination[edit]

   Main article: Self-Incrimination Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. V provides:

          [N]or shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case
          to be a witness against himself . . . .^[2]

   While the Self-Incrimination Clause primarily implicates the law of
   criminal investigations, the Clause also protects against
   self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause
   prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify
   against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses
   to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify
   first.^[80] But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the
   privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination
   within the scope of the direct examination.^[81]

   Similarly, the Clause "forbids either comment by the prosecution on the
   accused's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is
   evidence of guilt."^[82] This principle applies at the sentencing
   phase, even after a plea of guilty.^[83] While the defendant is
   entitled to an jury instruction forbidding adverse inferences from his
   or her failure to testify, a defendant is not entitled to prevent such
   an instruction.^[84]

   "Nothing in the Fifth Amendment privilege entitles a defendant as a
   matter of constitutional right to await the end of the State's case
   before announcing the nature of his defense, any more than it entitles
   him to await the jury's verdict on the State's case-in-chief before
   deciding whether or not to take the stand himself."^[85] For example, a
   jurisdiction may require the defendant to disclose intended alibi
   witnesses before trial.^[86]

Double jeopardy[edit]

   Main article: Double Jeopardy Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. V provides:

          [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be
          twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .^[2]

   The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions:
   subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after
   conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and
   multiple punishment in the same indictment.^[87] Jeopardy "attaches"
   when the jury empaneled, the first witness is sworn, or a plea is
   accepted.^[88] The "dual sovereignty doctrine" permits the federal
   government and each state to proceed separately.^[89]

   Prosecution after acquittal

   The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry
   of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is
   submitted to the jury,^[90] a directed verdict after a deadlocked
   jury,^[91] an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct
   appeal to a higher appellate court),^[92] or an "implied acquittal" via
   conviction of a lesser included offense.^[93] In addition, the
   government is barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against
   the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior
   acquittal,^[94] even if the jury hung on other counts.^[95]

   This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a
   pre-trial motion to dismiss^[96] or other non-merits dismissal,^[97] or
   a directed verdict after a jury conviction,^[98] Nor does it prevent
   the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a
   directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or
   statute.^[99] Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the
   defendant after a deadlocked jury,^[100] an appellate reversal other
   than for sufficiency,^[101] including habeas,^[102] or "thirteenth
   juror" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency^[103] on the
   principle that jeopardy has not "terminated." There may also be an
   exception for judicial bribery,^[104] but not jury bribery.

   Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction

   In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court announced the
   following test: the government may separately try and punish the
   defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the
   other does not.^[105] Blockburger is the default rule, unless the
   legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal
   Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,^[106]
   as can conspiracy.^[107]

   The Blockburger test, originally developed in the multiple punishments
   context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.^[108] In
   Grady v. Corbin (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation
   could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied,^[109] but
   Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon (1993).^[110]

   Prosecution after mistrial

   The rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the
   defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the
   prosecutor acted in "bad faith," i.e. goaded the defendant into moving
   for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a
   mistrial.^[111] If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar
   to retrial if the trial judge finds "manifest necessity" for granting
   the mistrial.^[112] The same standard governs mistrials granted sua
   sponte.

Assistance of Counsel[edit]

   Main article: Assistance of Counsel Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. VI provides:

          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
          . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.^[3]

   The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes, as relevant here, at least
   six distinct rights: the right to counsel of choice, the right to
   appointed counsel, the right not to be constructively denied counsel,
   the right to conflict-free counsel, the effective assistance of
   counsel, and the right to represent oneself pro se.

   A defendant does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in any
   civil proceeding, including a deportation hearing (even though
   deportability is often a collateral consequence of criminal
   conviction).^[113]

   Choice of counsel

   A defendant must be given an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not
   entitled to appointed counsel.^[114] Subject to considerations such as
   conflicts of interest,^[115] scheduling, counsel's authorization to
   practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to
   represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee),^[116] criminal
   defendants have a right to be represented by counsel of their choice.
   The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is
   automatic reversal.^[117]

   In Caplin & Drysdale v. United States (1989), the Court held that there
   is no Sixth Amendment exception to criminal forfeiture; i.e., after
   conviction, the government can seek forfeiture of already paid legal
   fees under a forfeiture statute, notwithstanding the effect on the
   defendant's ability to retain counsel of choice.^[118]

   Appointment of counsel

   A defendant unable to retain counsel has the right to appointed counsel
   at the government's expense. While the Supreme Court recognized this
   right gradually, it currently applies in all federal and state criminal
   proceedings where the defendant faces authorized imprisonment greater
   than one year (a "felony") or where the defendant is actually
   imprisoned.^[119]

   A defendant does not have a right to appointed counsel if he or she is
   not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced
   for more than one year,^[120] even if that conviction is later used to
   enhance sentencing for another crime,^[121] or even if the revocation
   of probation may result in actual imprisonment.^[122] Nor does the
   defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous
   arguments on direct appeal,^[123] or to raise any arguments on habeas
   or other collateral appeal,^[124] even if facing execution.^[125]

   Constructive denial

   Whether counsel are appointed or retained, the Clause protects the role
   of counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship.
   For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to
   consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the
   case pre-trial.^[126] And, the Clause also prohibits a state from
   barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel,^[127] or
   restricting the order in which the defendant may be called as a
   witness.^[128] Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from
   consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the
   recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant.^[129]
   Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing
   argument, even if a bench trial.^[130]

   Conflict-free counsel

   Whether counsel is retained or appointed, the defendant has a right to
   counsel without a conflict of interest.^[131] If an actual conflict of
   interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on
   the representation, the result is automatic reversal.^[132] The general
   rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived,^[133]
   but some conflicts are un-waiveable.^[134]

   Ineffective assistance of counsel

   Main article: Ineffective assistance of counsel

   In Strickland v. Washington (1984), the Court held that, on collateral
   review, a defendant may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates
   both (1) that defense counsel's performance fell below an objective
   standard of reasonableness (the "performance prong") and (2) that, but
   for the deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that
   the result of the proceeding would have been different (the "prejudice
   prong").^[135]

   To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads
   guilty must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for
   counsel's deficient performance, he or she would not have plead
   guilty.^[136] In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that
   counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of
   deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong
   of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty
   but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.^[137]

   To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland, a defendant who rejects
   the prosecution's plea offer must show that there is a reasonable
   probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer
   would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by the
   prosecution, and accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually
   received exceeded that which would have been received under the
   plea.^[138]

   Pro se representation

   Further information: Pro se legal representation in the United States

   In Faretta v. California (1975), the Court held that a criminal
   defendant has the right to knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se
   representation at trial.^[139] This right is not per se violated by the
   appointment of standby counsel.^[140] There is no constitutional right
   to self-representation on appeal.^[141]

Clauses of general applicability[edit]

   All of the foregoing constitutional provisions apply exclusively to
   criminal matters. In contrast, the due process and equal protection
   clauses have substantial application outside of the criminal law.

Due process[edit]

   Further information: Due Process Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. V provides:

          [N]or shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or
          property, without due process of law . . . .^[2]

   U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 provides:

          [N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
          property, without due process of law . . . .^[5]

   The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply
   generally to all stages of criminal proceedings. The Due Process Clause
   of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation of
   all of the foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury
   Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to
   apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall
   vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the
   infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another
   enumerated provision.^[142]

   Proof beyond a reasonable doubt

   Further information: Reasonable doubt

   The due process clauses require that the burden of proof in criminal
   cases be placed on the government, and that the quantum of proof be
   beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship (1970) explicitly held that
   "the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except
   upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to
   constitute the crime with which he is charged."^[143] But, the state
   may place the burden of proof for an affirmative defense on the
   defendant.^[144]

   Erroneous denial of a reasonable doubt instruction is a structural
   error that entitles the defendant to automatic reversal.^[145]
   Erroneous definitions of reasonable doubt do not require reversal as
   long as "taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the
   concept of reasonable doubt to the jury."^[146] Instructions on certain
   evidentiary presumptions against the defendant, if interpreted as
   conclusive presumptions or as shifting the burden of proof to the
   defendant, are also unconstitutional;^[147] permissive presumptions are
   constitutional.^[148] In some circumstances, a trial court must
   separately instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence, in
   addition to giving a reasonable doubt instruction.^[149]

   The reasonable doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury
   instructions, but it retains its relevance when the trial judge
   considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an
   appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence. On federal
   habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, to
   grant relief, the reviewing court must find that "upon the record
   evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have
   found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."^[150] In a successive,
   abusive, or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction, a
   defendant claiming "actual innocence" must show that "it is more likely
   than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty
   beyond a reasonable doubt."^[151]

   Brady disclosure

   Main article: Brady disclosure

   Brady v. Maryland (1963) is another significant, specific criminal
   procedural right guaranteed by the due process clauses. Brady requires
   a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds
   exculpatory (or impeachment^[152]) material, within the government's
   possession, from the defendant, and there is a reasonable probability
   that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding
   would have been different ("materiality").^[153] Brady is a holistic,
   rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.^[154]

   Whether the government acted in "good faith" or "bad faith" is
   irrelevant to Brady. But, if the defendant cannot prove that withheld
   evidence would have been exculpatory, because its import is unknown, to
   obtain relief, the defendant must instead show that the government
   acted in bad faith.^[155]

   The government is not required to disclose impeachment material prior
   to plea bargaining.^[156] Whether the government must disclose
   exculpatory material during plea bargaining is an open question.

   Mental competence

   Further information: Adjudicative competence

   "It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such
   that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the
   proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in
   preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial" consistent with
   the Due Process Clause.^[157] The "test" is "whether he has sufficient
   present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of
   rational understanding—and whether he has a rational as well as factual
   understanding of the proceedings against him."^[158]

   A state may place the burden on the defendant has to prove incompetence
   by the preponderance of the evidence,^[159] but the state cannot
   require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such
   as clear and convincing evidence.^[160] The right to competence cannot
   be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be
   knowing and voluntary.^[161] The state may involuntarily medicate the
   defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after
   factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as
   opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result
   in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore
   competence.^[162]

   A defendant who is competent to stand trial is therefore also competent
   to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights,^[163] but
   not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial in the
   face of a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of
   competence for pro se representation.^[164]

   Prosecutorial misconduct

   Due process prohibits the prosecution from knowingly using falsehood to
   convict the defendant, and requires reversal if there is a reasonable
   likelihood that the verdict was affected—whether the falsehood is
   inculpatory^[165] or goes the credibility of a witness.^[166]

Equal protection[edit]

   Further information: Equal Protection Clause

   U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 provides:

          [N]or shall any State . . . deny to any person within its
          jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.^[5]

   The equal protection clauses has at least three applications relevant
   to criminal proceedings: a prohibition on selective prosecution on
   invidious bases, a requirement that jury pools and venires represent a
   "fair cross section" of the community, and a prohibition on the
   discriminatory use of jury peremptory challenges.

   Selective prosecution

   Main article: Selective prosecution

   The defendant may move to dismiss a criminal charge on the ground that
   he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender,
   religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get
   discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must
   make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute
   similarly situated suspects of other races.^[167] The defendant is not
   entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data
   regarding the overall population of convicts.^[168]

   Discrimination in the jury pool and venire

   Further information: Jury selection in the United States
   A nineteenth century painting of a jury composed exclusively of white
   men

   The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the exclusion of persons from
   selection for a grand or petit jury on the basis of race,^[169]
   regardless of the race of the defendant.^[170]

   Further, the defendant is entitled to a jury pool that represents a
   "fair cross section" of the community. In order to prove a "fair cross
   section" violation, the defendant must show that (1) a "distinctive"
   (i.e., cognizable) group (2) is not represented fairly and reasonably
   in the jury pool in proportion to the community (3) due to systematic
   exclusion.^[171]

   Discriminatory peremptory challenges

   Further information: Peremptory challenge

   While a defendant is entitled to a fair cross section in the venire,
   the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual
   grand jury or petit jury.^[172] Yet, the equal protection clause does
   regulate the use of peremptory challenges in the selection of the petit
   jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky
   (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the
   prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.^[173]

   There are three steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party opposing
   the use of a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This
   requires only an inference, not preponderance.^[174] Second, the party
   seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral
   explanation for the challenge.^[175] Third, the trial court must decide
   whether the explanation is pretextual.^[176] A rationale is pretextual
   if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was
   seated.^[177]

   If the trial judge erroneously permits the striking of a juror under
   Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic
   reversal. If the trial judge erroneously prevents the striking of a
   juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a
   jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis.^[178] The race of the
   defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim.^[179] Batson also permits
   the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse
   Batson").^[180] And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.^[181]
