Second Constitutional Convention of the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   The Second Constitutional Convention of the United States is a proposal
   made by some scholars and activists^[1] from both left and right^[2]
   for a substantive effort to reform politics in the United States by
   means of overhauling the current United States Constitution. The
   current Constitution in Article V describes several ways in which the
   current constitution could be altered, but that in any event,
   three-fourths or 38 of the 50 states would be needed to ratify any
   changes.^[3]

History[edit]

   There have been scattered calls at the state level for a second
   convention throughout the nation's history. In 1943, a lawyer for
   Chicago-based Marshall Field's department store as well as Time Inc.
   wrote a book A Time for Change calling for a convention to "streamline
   the United States government."^[4] In the late 1960s, Senator Everett
   Dirksen called for a second constitutional convention by appealing to
   state legislatures to summon one.^[5] There have been acts by state
   legislatures urging Congress to press for constitutional amendments to
   deal with apportionment issues as well as the balanced budget
   amendment.^[6]
   Columnist William Safire.
   Catherine Crier.

   A report in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2011 described the movement
   for a second convention as gaining "traction" in public debate,^[1] and
   wrote that "concern over a seemingly dysfunctional climate in
   Washington and issues ranging from the national debt to the
   overwhelming influence of money in politics have spawned calls for
   fundamental change in the document that guides the nation's
   government."^[1] For several years, state lawmakers approved no Article
   V Convention calls at all, and even went so far as to adopt resolutions
   rescinding their prior such calls. However, in 2011, legislators in
   Alabama, Louisiana, and North Dakota (in two instances) approved
   resolutions applying for an Article V Convention. All three of these
   states had adopted rescissions in 1988, 1990, and 2001, respectively,
   but then reversed course in 2011. The very same was true in 2012 with
   New Hampshire lawmakers who had just adopted a resolution to rescind
   previous convention applications as recently as 2010.

   Many states have called for an Article V Convention to discuss adding a
   Balanced Budget Amendment to the Federal Constitution. To summon such a
   convention for this amendment, 34 states need to apply. In 2013, the
   number of states making the application is unclear; it may be either 33
   or 20,^[7] and the tally may depend on rulings about whether past state
   applications may or may not be rescinded. In 1983, Missouri
   applied;^[8] in 2013, Ohio applied.^[9] It may take years before a
   sufficient number of state legislatures apply; if such a convention
   happened, the Balanced Budget Amendment would happen if 38 states
   ratified the amendment.

   At the congressional level, exactly one month to the date before his
   death in a February 14, 1975, plane crash, the late U.S. Representative
   Jerry L. Pettis, Republican of California, went so far as to introduce
   House Concurrent Resolution No. 28 which—had it been approved by both
   houses of Congress—would have triggered a national convention to have
   been assembled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for the purpose of
   proposing amendments to the federal Constitution. Pettis' concurrent
   resolution would have stipulated that each state would have been
   entitled to send as many delegates to that convention as it had
   Senators and Representatives in Congress and that such delegates would
   be selected in the manner designated by the legislature of such state.
   On August 5, 1977, former U.S. Representative Norman F. Lent Republican
   of New York introduced House Concurrent Resolution No. 340, which was
   quite similar to Pettis' 1975 H.Con.Res. 28. Lent's H.Con.Res. 340
   received no further consideration than to be referred to the House's
   Committee on the Judiciary.

   A report by analyst David Gergen in CNN suggested that despite serious
   differences between left-leaning Occupy movements and the right-leaning
   Tea Party movements, there was considerable agreement on both sides
   that money plays "far too large a role in politics."^[10] Scholars such
   as Richard Labunski, Sanford Levinson, Lawrence Lessig, Glenn
   Reynolds,^[1] Larry Sabato,^[11] newspaper columnist William
   Safire,^[12] and activists such as John Booth of the Dallas movement
   RestoringFreedom.org have called for constitutional changes that would
   curb the dominant role of money in politics.^[1] Scholar Stein Ringen
   in his book Nation of Devils suggested that only a "total overhaul" of
   the constitution could fix the "years of accumulated damage and
   dysfunction," according to a report in the Economist in 2013.^[13]
   French journalist Jean-Philippe Immarigeon suggested in Harper's
   magazine that the "nearly 230-year-old constitution stretched past the
   limits of its usefulness".^[14] A report in USA Today suggested that 17
   of 34 states have petitioned Congress for a convention to deal with the
   issue of a balanced budget amendment.^[3] A report in CNN suggested
   that 30 state legislatures are considering resolutions either calling
   for a constitutional convention or else proposing changes to the
   Constitution.^[15] David O. Stewart suggested that possible topics for
   Constitutional amendments might include the elimination of the
   electoral college and switching to direct election of the president, a
   ban on procedures in the House or Senate which require a supermajority
   vote as a means to prevent minorities or powerful Senators from
   blocking legislation, term limits for congresspersons, and a balanced
   budget amendment.^[16]

   While in 2011, the number of voices calling for such a Constitutional
   Convention were small in number, there were reports of state
   legislatures leaning in the direction of substantive constitutional
   reform, based in part on widespread dissatisfaction with the American
   political process at the national level. In contrast, however, analyst
   David O. Stewart, writing in the Huffington Post, suggested that most
   Americans would "recoil from the disruption" of a possible second
   Constitution.^[16]

Questions[edit]

   Numerous questions surround the issue of how a convention might happen,
   partially because a second one has never happened in the nation's
   history.^[3] There is no consensus on how such a convention may be
   organized, led, or who may be selected to be in such a body.

     Because there has not been a constitutional convention since 1787,
     efforts have been clouded by unresolved legal questions: Do the
     calls for a convention have to happen at the same time? Can a
     convention be limited to just one topic? What if Congress simply
     refuses to call a convention? Scholars are split on all those
     issues.

   —report in the Indystar, 2011^[17]

Precedent[edit]

   While there is no political precedent for such a convention, some
   scholars have noted that the original 1787 Convention, itself, was the
   first precedent, since it had only been authorized to amend the
   Articles of Confederation and not to draw up an entirely original and
   new Constitution which it did secretly during the summer of 1787.^[3]
   According to The New York Times, the action by the Founding Fathers set
   up a precedent that could be used today.^[18] But, since 1787, there
   has not been one overall constitutional convention.^[19] All 27
   amendments to the Constitution, except the 21st, were first approved by
   two thirds of both the House and Senate and then approved by three
   fourths of the several states.^[17]

   However, "in the context of the Seventeenth Amendment (making the
   Senate elected), ... the states came within one vote of calling for a
   convention, and the Congress quickly proposed the amendment the
   convention would have proposed."^[20]

   It's far from clear how many of those calling for a constitutional
   convention want to completely replace the current constitution vs.
   merely proposing one or more amendments, which would still require
   separate approval by three fourths of the several states.

Scope of a possible convention[edit]

   There have been calls for a second convention based on a single issue
   such as the Balanced Budget Amendment. According to one count, 17 of 34
   states have petitioned Congress for a "convention to propose a balanced
   budget amendment."^[17] But Congress has been reluctant to "impose
   limitations on its spending and borrowing and taxing powers", according
   to anti-tax activist David Biddulph.^[17] Law professor Michael Stokes
   Paulsen suggested that such a convention would have the "power to
   propose anything it sees fit" and that calls for a convention to focus
   on only one issue "may not be valid", according to this view.^[17]
   According to Paulsen's count, 33 states have called for a general
   convention, although some of these calls have been pending "since the
   19th century."^[17]

   According to a New York Times report, different groups would be nervous
   that a convention summoned to address only one issue might propose a
   wholesale revision of the entire Constitution, possibly limiting
   "provisions they hold dear."^[18] Such groups include the American
   Civil Liberties Union, the John Birch Society, the National
   Organization for Women, the Gun Owners Clubs of America and
   conservative advocate Phyllis Schlafly.^[18] Accordingly, they are
   opposed to the idea of a second convention.^[18] Lawrence Lessig
   countered that the requirement of having 38 states ratify any proposed
   revision––three-quarters of all state legislatures––meant that any
   extreme proposals would be blocked, since either 13 red or 13 blue
   states could block such a measure.^[17]

Language[edit]

   Constitutional law scholar Lawrence Tribe noted that the language in
   the current Constitution about how to implement a second one is
   "dangerously vague", and that there is a possibility that the same
   interests that have corrupted Washington's politics^[clarification
   needed] may have a hand in efforts to rewrite it.^[1] Politicians and
   scholars who are reluctant to have a second constitutional convention
   may insist that all 34 state petitions to Congress must have an
   identical wording or otherwise the petitions would be considered
   invalid.^[6]

Particular views[edit]

   Lawrence Lessig
   Sanford Levinson

   Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has argued that a movement
   to urge state legislatures to call for a Constitutional Convention^[17]
   was the best possibility to achieve substantive reform:

     But somebody at the convention said that "what if Congress is the
     problem -- what do we do then?" So they set up an alternative
     path... that states can call on Congress to call a Convention. The
     convention, then, proposes the amendments, and those amendments have
     to pass by three fourths of the states. So, either way, thirty eight
     states have to ratify an amendment, but the sources of those
     amendments are different. One is inside, one is outside.

   —--Lawrence Lessig, 2011.^[21]

   Lessig argued that the ordinary means of politics were not feasible to
   solve the problem affecting the United States government because the
   incentives corrupting politicians are so powerful.^[22] Lessig believes
   a convention is needed in view of Supreme Court decisions to eliminate
   most limits on campaign contributions.^[23] He quoted congressperson
   Jim Cooper from Tennessee who remarked that Congress had become a "Farm
   League for K Street" in the sense that congresspersons were focused on
   lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving in the Congress, and not
   on serving the public interest.^[24] He proposed that such a convention
   be populated by a random drawing of citizens' names as a way to keep
   special interests out of the process.

   Constitutional scholar and University of Texas Law School professor
   Sanford Levinson wrote Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the
   Constitution Goes Wrong and called for a "wholesale revision of our
   nation's founding document."^[25] Levinson wrote:

     We ought to think about it almost literally every day, and then ask,
     'Well, to what extent is government organized to realize the noble
     visions of the preamble?' That the preamble begins, 'We the people.'
     It's a notion of a people that can engage in self-determination.

   —--Sanford Levinson, 2006^[26]

   Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, in a keynote speech at Harvard
   Law School, said the movement for a new convention was a reflection of
   having in many ways "the worst political class in our country's
   history."^[1]

   Political scientist Larry Sabato believes a second convention is
   necessary since "piecemeal amendments" have not been working.^[11]
   Sabato argued that America needs a "grand meeting of clever and
   high-minded people to draw up a new, improved constitution better
   suited to the 21st century."^[11]

   Author Scott Turow sees risks with a possible convention but believes
   it may be the only possible way to undo how campaign money has
   undermined the "one-man one-vote" premise.^[23]

   Fewer new constitutions are modeled along the lines of the American
   version, according to a study by David Law of Washington
   University.^[27] Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg views the
   United States Constitution as more of a relic of the 18th century
   rather than as a model for new constitutions, and she suggested in 2014
   that a nation seeking a new constitution might find a better model by
   examining the constitutions of South Africa (1997), the Canadian
   Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) and the European Convention on
   Human Rights (1950).^[27]

     I would not look to the United States Constitution if I were
     drafting a constitution in the year 2012.

   —Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 2014^[27]

Current efforts to call a Second Constitutional Convention[edit]

   Wolf PAC logo
   Citizens for Self-Governance logo

Wolf-PAC[edit]

   There have been calls by the Occupy Wall Street and related Occupy
   movements to focus demands on a second constitutional convention.^[28]
   A political action committee called Wolf-PAC, headed by The Young Turks
   host Cenk Uygur, emerged from New York's Occupy movement; the PAC calls
   for a constitutional amendment to remove money from politics.^[29]^[30]
   In 2014, the states of Vermont and California, prompted by Wolf PAC,
   passed a resolution calling for a Second Constitutional Convention to
   overturn the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court.^[31]

Citizens for Self-Governance[edit]

   A group called Citizens for Self-Governance (CSG) is actively engaged
   in an effort to call an Article V Convention. Through an initiative
   called Convention of States, CSG is seeking "to urge and empower state
   legislators to call a convention of states." CSG states that it
   initiated the Convention of States project "for the purpose of stopping
   the runaway power of the federal government."^[32]^[33]^[34]^[35]^[36]
   Mark Levin has supported CSG's efforts to a call a second
   constitutional convention.^[36] Levin's book The Liberty Amendments:
   Restoring the American Republic details his plan for an Article V
   convention of states, and eleven proposed amendments.^[37]^[38]
