Impeachment in the United States

   management.
   The impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, Chief Justice
   William Rehnquist presiding. The House managers are seated beside the
   quarter-circular tables on the left and the president's personal
   counsel on the right, much in the fashion of President Andrew Johnson's
   trial.

   Impeachment in the US is an expressed power of the legislature that
   allows for formal charges against a civil officer of government for
   crimes committed in office. The actual trial on those charges, and
   subsequent removal of an official on conviction on those charges, is
   separate from the act of impeachment itself.

   Impeachment is analogous to indictment in regular court proceedings,
   while trial by the other house is analogous to the trial before judge
   and jury in regular courts. Typically, the lower house of the
   legislature will impeach the official and the upper house will conduct
   the trial.

   At the federal level, Article II of the United States Constitution
   (Section 4) states that "The President, Vice President, and all civil
   Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on
   Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High
   Crimes and Misdemeanors." The House of Representatives has the sole
   power of impeaching, while the United States Senate has the sole power
   to try all impeachments. The removal of impeached officials is
   automatic upon conviction in the Senate. In Nixon v. United States
   (1993), the Supreme Court determined that the federal judiciary cannot
   review such proceedings.

   Impeachment can also occur at the state level; state legislatures can
   impeach state officials, including governors, according to their
   respective state constitutions.

   At the Philadelphia Convention, Benjamin Franklin noted that,
   historically, the removal of “obnoxious” chief executives had been
   accomplished by assassination. Franklin suggested that a proceduralized
   mechanism for removal — impeachment — would be preferable.^[1]

Federal impeachment[edit]

House of Representatives[edit]

   Depiction of the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, in
   1868, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding.

   Impeachment proceedings may be commenced by a member of the House of
   Representatives on their own initiative, either by presenting a listing
   of the charges under oath, or by asking for referral to the appropriate
   committee. The impeachment process may be triggered by non-members. For
   example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a
   federal judge be impeached, a charge of what actions constitute grounds
   for impeachment may come from a special prosecutor, the President, a
   state or territorial legislature, grand jury, or by petition.

   The type of impeachment resolution determines to which committee it
   will be referred. A resolution impeaching a particular individual is
   typically referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. A
   resolution to authorize an investigation regarding impeachable conduct
   is referred to the House Committee on Rules, and then referred to the
   Judiciary Committee. The House Committee on the Judiciary, by majority
   vote, will determine whether grounds for impeachment exist. If the
   Committee finds grounds for impeachment they will set forth specific
   allegations of misconduct in one or more articles of impeachment. The
   Impeachment Resolution, or Article(s) of Impeachment, are then reported
   to the full House with the committee's recommendations.

   The House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the
   resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment
   individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required
   for each article or the resolution as a whole to pass. If the House
   votes to impeach, managers (typically referred to as "House managers",
   with a "lead House manager") are selected to present the case to the
   Senate. Recently, managers have been selected by resolution, while
   historically the House would occasionally elect the managers or pass a
   resolution allowing the appointment of managers at the discretion of
   the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. These
   managers are roughly the equivalent of the prosecution/district
   attorney in a standard criminal trial.

   Also, the House will adopt a resolution in order to notify the Senate
   of its action. After receiving the notice, the Senate will adopt an
   order notifying the House that it is ready to receive the managers. The
   House managers then appear before the bar of the Senate and exhibit the
   articles of impeachment. After the reading of the charges, the managers
   return and make a verbal report to the House.

Senate[edit]

   The proceedings unfold in the form of a trial, with each side having
   the right to call witnesses and perform cross-examinations. The House
   members, who are given the collective title of managers during the
   course of the trial, present the prosecution case and the impeached
   official has the right to mount a defense with his own attorneys as
   well. Senators must also take an oath or affirmation that they will
   perform their duties honestly and with due diligence (as opposed to the
   House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, who vote upon
   their honor). After hearing the charges, the Senate usually deliberates
   in private. The U.S. Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for
   conviction.

   The Senate enters judgment on its decision, whether that be to convict
   or acquit, and a copy of the judgment is filed with the Secretary of
   State.^[2] Upon conviction, the official is automatically removed from
   office and may also be barred from holding future office. The removed
   official is also liable to criminal prosecution. The President may not
   grant a pardon in the impeachment case, but may in any resulting
   criminal case.

   Beginning in the 1980s, the Senate began using "Impeachment Trial
   Committees" pursuant to Senate Rule XI.^[3] These committees presided
   over the evidentiary phase of the trials, hearing the evidence and
   supervising the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The
   committees would then compile the evidentiary record and present it to
   the Senate; all senators would then have the opportunity to review the
   evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit. The purpose of
   the committees was to streamline impeachment trials, which otherwise
   would have taken up a great deal of the chamber's time. Defendants
   challenged the use of these committees, claiming them to be a violation
   of their fair trial rights as well as the Senate's constitutional
   mandate, as a body, to have "sole power to try all impeachments."
   Several impeached judges sought court intervention in their impeachment
   proceedings on these grounds, but the courts refused to become involved
   due to the Constitution's granting of impeachment and removal power
   solely to the legislative branch, making it a political question.

History[edit]

   In writing Article II, Section Four, George Mason had favored
   impeachment for "maladministration" (incompetence), but James Madison,
   who favored impeachment only for criminal behavior, carried the
   issue.^[4] Hence, cases of impeachment may be undertaken only for
   "treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors." However,
   some scholars, such as Kevin Gutzman, have disputed this view and argue
   that the phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" was intended to have a
   much more expansive meaning.

   The Congress traditionally regards impeachment as a power to use only
   in extreme cases; the House of Representatives has actually initiated
   impeachment proceedings only 62 times since 1789. Two cases did not
   come to trial because the individuals had left office.

   Actual impeachments of 19 federal officers have taken place. Of these,
   15 were federal judges: thirteen district court judges, one court of
   appeals judge (who also sat on the Commerce Court), and one Supreme
   Court Associate Justice. Of the other four, two were Presidents, one
   was a Cabinet secretary, and one was a U.S. Senator. Of the 19
   impeached officials, eight were convicted. One, former judge Alcee
   Hastings, was elected as a member of the United States House of
   Representatives after being removed from office.

   The 1797 impeachment of Senator William Blount of Tennessee stalled on
   the grounds that the Senate lacked jurisdiction over him. Because, in a
   separate action unrelated to the impeachment procedure, the Senate had
   already expelled Blount, the lack of jurisdiction may have been either
   because Blount was no longer a Senator, or because Senators are not
   civil officers of the federal government and therefore not subject to
   impeachment. No other member of Congress has ever been impeached,
   although the Constitution does give authority to either house to expel
   its own members (not members of the other chamber), which each has done
   on occasion (see List of United States senators expelled or censured
   and List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or
   reprimanded). Expulsion removes the individual from functioning as a
   representative or senator because of their misbehavior, but unlike
   impeachment, expulsion cannot result in barring an individual from
   holding future office.

Impeachment of a U.S. President[edit]

   Two U.S. Presidents have been impeached by the House of
   Representatives—Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998—both
   later acquitted at trials held by the Senate. While articles of
   impeachment against Richard Nixon were passed by the House Judiciary
   Committee in 1974, Nixon resigned the Presidency before the impeachment
   resolutions could be considered.

   When an Impeachment process involves a U.S. President, the Chief
   Justice of the United States is required to preside during the Senate
   trial.^[5] In all other trials, the Vice President would preside in his
   capacity as President of the Senate. Some academics have suggested that
   due to an omission in the Constitution, the Vice President also would
   preside over his or her own impeachment trial,^[6] but the logic of
   this argument has been questioned.^[7]

Demands for impeachment[edit]

   See also: Impeachment investigations of United States federal officials

   While actually impeaching a federal public official is a rare event,
   demands for impeachment, especially of presidents, are extremely
   common,^[20]^[21] going back to the administration of George Washington
   in the mid-1790s. In fact, most of the 63 resolutions mentioned above
   were in response to presidential actions.

   While almost all of them were for the most part frivolous and were
   buried as soon as they were introduced, several did have their intended
   effect. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon^[22] and Supreme Court Justice
   Abe Fortas both resigned in response to the threat of impeachment
   hearings, and, most famously, President Richard Nixon resigned from
   office after the House Judiciary Committee had already reported
   articles of impeachment to the floor.

Impeachment in the states[edit]

   State legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors.
   The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the
   federal model — in New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house)
   impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but the members of the
   seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest,
   constitutional court) sit with the senators as jurors as well.^[23]
   Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally
   throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption
   charges. A total of at least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an
   impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped
   impeachment conviction by a single vote in 1912. Several others, most
   recently Connecticut's John G. Rowland, have resigned rather than face
   impeachment, when events seemed to make it inevitable.^[24] The most
   recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009,
   when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117-1 to impeach Rod
   Blagojevich on corruption charges;^[25] he was subsequently removed
   from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois
   Senate on January 29. He was the eighth state governor in American
   history to be removed from office.

   The procedure for impeachment, or removal, of local officials varies
   widely. For instance, in New York a mayor is removed directly by the
   governor "upon being heard" on charges — the law makes no further
   specification of what charges are necessary or what the governor must
   find in order to remove a mayor.

    1. ^ "Removed and disqualified" indicates that following conviction
       the Senate voted to disqualify the individual from holding further
       federal office pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of the United
       States Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part, that
       "[j]udgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than
       to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
       office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."
    2. ^ During the impeachment trial of Senator Blount, it was argued
       that the House of Representatives did not have the power to impeach
       members of either House of Congress; though the Senate never
       explicitly ruled on this argument, the House has never again
       impeached a member of Congress. The Constitution allows either
       House to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, which the
       Senate had done to Blount on the same day the House impeached him
       (but before the Senate heard the case).
    3. ^ Judge Nixon later challenged the validity of his removal from
       office on procedural grounds; the challenge was ultimately rejected
       as nonjusticiable by the Supreme Court in Nixon v. United States,
       506 U.S. 224 (1993).
