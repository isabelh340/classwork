   The Eleventh Amendment in the National Archives

   The Eleventh Amendment (Amendment XI) to the United States
   Constitution, which was passed by the Congress on March 4, 1794, and
   ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. The amendment deals with
   each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted in order to overrule
   the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419
   (1793).^[1]

Text[edit]

     The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to
     extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against
     one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by
     Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.

Background[edit]

   See also: State sovereign immunity

   The Eleventh Amendment, which was the first Constitutional amendment
   after the adoption of the Bill of Rights, was adopted following the
   Supreme Court's ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793). In
   Chisholm, the Court ruled that federal courts had the authority to hear
   cases in law and equity brought by private citizens against states and
   that states did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suits made by
   citizens of other states in federal court. Thus, the amendment
   clarified Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which gave
   diversity jurisdiction to the judiciary to hear cases "between a state
   and citizens of another state."

Proposal and ratification[edit]

   The Eleventh Amendment was proposed by the 3rd Congress on March 4,
   1794, when it was approved by the House of Representatives by vote of
   81 – 9,^[2] having been previously passed by the Senate, 23 – 2, on
   January 14.^[3] The amendment was ratified by the state legislatures of
   the following states:^[4]
    1. New York — March 27, 1794
    2. Rhode Island — March 31, 1794
    3. Connecticut — May 8, 1794
    4. New Hampshire — June 16, 1794
    5. Massachusetts — June 26, 1794
    6. Vermont — November 9, 1794
    7. Virginia — November 18, 1794
    8. Georgia — November 29, 1794
    9. Kentucky — December 7, 1794
   10. Maryland — December 26, 1794
   11. Delaware — January 23, 1795
   12. North Carolina — February 7, 1795
       Having been ratified by the requisite three–fourths of the several
       states, there being 15 States in the Union at the time, the
       ratification of the Eleventh Amendment was completed. It was
       subsequently ratified by:
   13. South Carolina — December 4, 1797

   An official announcement of ratification was not made until January 8,
   1798, when President John Adams in a message to Congress stated that
   the Eleventh Amendment had been adopted by the necessary number of
   States and that it may now be declared to be a part of the Constitution
   of the United States.^[5] New Jersey and Pennsylvania did not take
   action on the amendment; neither did Tennessee, which had become a
   state on June 16, 1796.

Impact[edit]

   In Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 U.S. 378 (1798), the Supreme Court held
   that every pending action brought under Chisholm had to be dismissed
   because of the amendment's adoption.^[6]

   The amendment's text does not mention suits brought against a state by
   its own citizens. However, in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), the
   Supreme Court ruled that the amendment reflects a broader principle of
   sovereign immunity. As Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five
   Justice majority, stated in Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999):

     [S]overeign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but
     from the structure of the original Constitution itself....Nor can we
     conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress
     necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or
     otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private
     suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope
     of the enumerated powers.^[7]

   Writing for a four-Justice dissent in Alden, Justice David Souter said
   the states surrendered their sovereign immunity when they ratified the
   Constitution. The dissenting justices read the amendment's text as
   reflecting a narrow form of sovereign immunity that limited only the
   diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts. They concluded that the
   states are not insulated from suits by individuals by either the
   Eleventh Amendment in particular or the Constitution in general.^[8]

   Although the Eleventh Amendment grants immunity to states from suit for
   money damages or equitable relief without their consent, in Ex parte
   Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts
   may enjoin state officials from violating federal law. In Fitzpatrick
   v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress
   may abrogate state immunity from suit under Section 5 of the Fourteenth
   Amendment. In Central Virginia Community College v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356
   (2006), the Court ruled the Congress could do the same regarding
   bankruptcy cases by way of Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the
   Constitution. In Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. System of Ga.,
   535 U.S. 613 (2002), the Supreme Court ruled that when a state invokes
   a federal court's removal jurisdiction, it waives the Eleventh
   Amendment in the removed case.

   The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has ruled that
   Puerto Rico enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity.^[9]
