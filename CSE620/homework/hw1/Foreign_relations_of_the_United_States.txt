Pacific[edit]

   Country Formal Relations Began Notes
    Australia 1940^[1] See Australia–United States relations

   Australia's relations with the United States are excellent.^[2]
   Australia and the United States have long been close and stragetic
   allies and have traditionally been aligned with the Commonwealth of
   Nations. It has, however, strengthened its relationship with the United
   States since 1942, as Britain's influence in Asia declined, to
   establish its current position as a staunch American ally. At the
   governmental level, United-States-Australia relations are formalized by
   the ANZUS treaty and the Australia–United States Free Trade
   Agreement.^[citation needed]
    Cook Islands 2005 or before See Foreign relations of the Cook Islands

   In November 2005 the US Ambassador McCormick stated "I’ve been
   ...accredited to... the Cook Islands."^[3] and he participated in
   various activities in the region.^[4]^[5] The statement of the US
   Ambassador signifies that there are established diplomatic relations
   between the two states, but neither this nor the accreditation of the
   Ambassador are mentioned at the CIA's World Factbook website of 2005,
   2006, 2007, 2008, 2012.^[6] The Cook Islands have a Honorary Consul in
   and recognized by the US since 1995.^[7]^[8]
    Fiji 1971^[9] See Fiji–United States relations

   Relations are currently poor, due to the United States' opposition to
   Fiji's unelected government, which came to power through a military
   coup in December 2006. The United States suspended $2.5 million in aid
   money pending a review of the situation, following the 2006 coup.^[10]
    Kiribati 1980^[11] See Kiribati–United States relations

   Relations between Kiribati and the United States are excellent.
   Kiribati signed a treaty of friendship with the United States after
   independence in 1979. The United States has no consular or diplomatic
   facilities in the country. Officers of the American Embassy in Suva,
   Fiji, are concurrently accredited to Kiribati and make periodic visits.
   The U.S. Peace Corps maintained a program in Kiribati from 1974 to
   2008.
    Marshall Islands 1986 See Marshall Islands–United States relations

   The Marshall Islands is a sovereign nation in "free association" with
   the United States. The Marshall Islands and the United States maintain
   excellent relations. After more than a decade of negotiation, the
   Marshall Islands and the United States signed the Compact of Free
   Association on June 25, 1983. The Compact gives the U.S. full authority
   and responsibility over defense of the Marshall Islands. The Marshall
   Islands and the United States both lay claim to Wake Island. The
   Compact that binds the U.S. and the Marshall Islands is the same one
   that binds the United States and the Federated States of Micronesia.
    Federated States of Micronesia 1986^[12] See Federated States of
   Micronesia–United States relations

   Reflecting a strong legacy of Trusteeship cooperation, over 25 U.S.
   federal agencies continue to maintain programs in the FSM. The United
   States and the FSM share very strong relations. Under the Amended
   Compact, the U.S. has full authority and responsibility for the defense
   of the FSM. This security relationship can be changed or terminated by
   mutual agreement. The Compact that binds the U.S. and the FSM is the
   same one that binds the United States to the Marshall Islands and to
   Palau.
    Nauru 1976^[13] See Nauru–United States relations

   Relations between Nauru and the United States are complicated. While
   the new US Ambassador to Fiji has promised Nauru assistance in economic
   development, there have been disagreements about Cuba and Foreign
   policy of the United States, and the United States does not have an
   embassy in Nauru. Instead the US Embassy staff in Suva, Fiji make
   periodical visits
    New Zealand 1942^[14] See New Zealand–United States relations

   Relations are strong, but complex. The United States has historically
   assisted New Zealand in times of turmoil; for instance, during World
   War II and with the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. New Zealand has
   reciprocated; for example, by participating in the Vietnam War.
   However, the United States suspended its mutual defense obligations to
   New Zealand because of that state's non-nuclear policies.
    Palau 1996^[15] See Palau–United States relations

   On October 1, 1994, after five decades of US administration, the
   country of Palau became the last component of the Trust Territory of
   the Pacific Islands to gain its independence. In 1978, Palau decided
   not to join the Federated States of Micronesia, due to culture and
   language differences, and instead sought independence. In 1986, the
   Compact of Free Association agreement between Palau and the United
   States was approved, paving the way for Palau's independence.
    Papua New Guinea 1975^[16] See Papua New Guinea–United States
   relations
    Samoa 1962^[17] See Samoa–United States relations
    Solomon Islands 1978^[18] See Solomon Islands–United States relations

   After independence in 1978, the United States kept its close relations
   with the Solomon Islands. Both cooperate within regional organizations
   in the Pacific, and the United States has an embassy at Port Moresby.
    Tonga 1886; 1972^[19] See Tonga–United States relations
    Tuvalu 1978^[19] See Tuvalu–United States relations

   Relations between the two countries are generally amicable, or neutral,
   but there have been notable disagreements regarding the issues of
   climate change and the Kyoto Protocol.
    Vanuatu 1986^[20] See United States–Vanuatu relations

   The United States and Vanuatu established diplomatic relations on
   September 30, 1986 - three months to the day after Vanuatu had
   established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.^[21] Relations
   were often tense in the 1980s, under the prime ministership of Father
   Walter Lini in Vanuatu, but eased after that. At present, bilateral
   relations consist primarily in US aid to Vanuatu.

Americas[edit]

   Country Formal Relations Began Notes
    Argentina 1823^[22] See Argentina–United States relations

   The United States has a positive bilateral relationship with Argentina
   based on many common strategic interests, including non-proliferation,
   counternarcotics, counter-terrorism, the fight against human
   trafficking, and issues of regional stability, as well as the strength
   of commercial ties. Argentina is a participant in the Three-Plus-One
   regional mechanism (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,and the U.S.), which
   focuses on coordination of counter-terrorism policies in the tri-border
   region. Argentina has endorsed the Proliferation Security Initiative,
   and has implemented the Container Security Initiative and the Trade
   Transparency Unit, both of which are programs administered by the U.S.
   Department of Homeland Security/Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
   However they have some things between them as Argentina is a source of
   drugs in the USA.
    Bolivia 1849^[23] See Bolivia–United States relations

   Although President Evo Morales has been publicly critical of U.S.
   policies, the United States and Bolivia have a tradition of cordial and
   cooperative relations. Development assistance from the United States to
   Bolivia dates from the 1940s, and the U.S. remains a major partner for
   economic development, improved health, democracy, and the environment.
   In 1991, the U.S. Government forgave all of the $341 million debt owed
   by Bolivia to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as
   well as 80% ($31 million) of the amount owed to the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture for food assistance. The United States has also been a
   strong supporter of forgiveness of Bolivia's multilateral debt under
   the HIPC initiatives.
    Brazil 1824^[24] See Brazil–United States relations

   The United States was the first country to recognize the independence
   of Brazil, doing so in 1808. Brazil-United States relations have a long
   history, characterized by some moments of remarkable convergence of
   interests but also by sporadic and critical divergences on sensitive
   international issues.^[25] The United States has increasingly regarded
   Brazil as a significant power, especially in its role as a stabilizing
   force and skillful interlocutor in Latin America.^[26] As a significant
   political and economic power, Brazil has traditionally preferred to
   cooperate with the United States on specific issues rather than seeking
   to develop an all-encompassing, privileged relationship with the United
   States.^[27]
    Canada 1926^[28] See Canada–United States relations

   Relations between Canada and the United States span more than two
   centuries, marked by a shared British colonial heritage, conflict
   during the early years of the U.S., and the eventual development of one
   of the most successful international relationships in the modern world.
   The most serious breach in the relationship was the War of 1812, which
   saw an American invasion of then British North America and counter
   invasions from British-Canadian forces. The border was demilitarized
   after the war and, apart from minor raids, has remained peaceful.
   Military collaboration began during the World Wars and continued
   throughout the Cold War, despite Canadian doubts about certain American
   policies. A high volume of trade and migration between the U.S. and
   Canada has generated closer ties, despite continued Canadian fears of
   being overwhelmed by its neighbor, which is ten times larger in
   population, GDP, and debt.^[29]
    Chile 1824^[30] See Chile–United States relations

   Relations between Chile and the United States have been better in the
   period 1988 to 2008 than any other time in history. In the late 1980s
   and early 1990s, the United States government applauded the rebirth of
   democratic practices in Chile, despite having facilitated the 1973
   Chilean coup d'état, the build-up to which included destabilizing the
   country's economy and politics. Regarded as one of the least corrupt
   and most vibrant democracies in South America, with a healthy economy,
   Chile is noted as being a valuable ally of the United States in the
   Southern Hemisphere. A prime example of cooperation includes the
   landmark 2003 U.S.A/Chile Free Trade Agreement.
    Colombia 1822^[31] See Colombia–United States relations

   Relations between Colombia and the United States have evolved from
   mutual cordiality during most of the 19th and early 20th
   centuries^[citation needed] to a recent partnership that links the
   governments of both nations around several key issues, including
   fighting communism, the War on Drugs, and especially since 9/11, the
   threat of terrorism. During the last fifty years, different American
   governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian
   affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the above
   issues. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law
   Professor John Barry, consider that US influences have catalyzed
   internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of
   human rights abuses in Colombia.^[32] Supporters, such as Under
   Secretary of State Marc Grossman, consider that the U.S. has promoted
   respect for human rights and the rule of law in Colombia, in addition
   to the fight against drugs and terrorism.^[33]
    Costa Rica 1851^[34] See Costa Rica–United States relations
    Ecuador 1832^[35] See Ecuador–United States relations
    El Salvador 1824; 1849^[36] See El Salvador–United States relations
    Guatemala 1824; 1844^[37] See Guatemala–United States relations
    Haiti 1862^[38] See Haiti–United States relations
    Honduras 1824; 1853^[39] See Honduras–United States relations
    Mexico 1822^[40] See Mexico–United States relations

   The United States of America shares a unique and often complex
   relationship with the United Mexican States. The two countries have
   close economic ties, being each other's first and third largest trading
   partners. They are also closely connected demographically, with over
   one million U.S. citizens living in Mexico and Mexico being the largest
   source of immigrants to the United States. Illegal immigration and
   illegal trade in drugs and in fire arms have been causes of differences
   but also of cooperation.
    Nicaragua 1824; 1849^[41] See Nicaragua–United States relations
    Panama 1903^[42] See Panama–United States relations

   Relations have been generally strong, with 25,000 U.S. citizens present
   in Panama and a mutual healthcare program.
    Paraguay 1852^[43] See Paraguay–United States relations
    Peru 1826^[44] See Peru–United States relations
    Uruguay 1836^[45] See United States–Uruguay relations

   In 2002, Uruguay and the U.S. created a Joint Commission on Trade and
   Investment (JCTI) to exchange ideas on a variety of economic topics. In
   March 2003, the JCTI identified six areas of concentration until the
   eventual signing of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA): customs
   issues, intellectual property protection, investment, labor,
   environment, and trade in goods. In late 2004, Uruguay and the U.S.
   signed an Open Skies Agreement, which was ratified in May 2006. In
   November 2005, they signed a Bilateral investment treaty (BIT), which
   entered into force on November 1, 2006. A Trade and Investment
   Framework Agreement (TIFA) was signed in January 2007. More than 80
   U.S.-owned companies operate in Uruguay, and many more market U.S.
   goods and services.
    Venezuela 1835^[46] See United States–Venezuela relations

   After the election of Presidents Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and George W.
   Bush of the United States and particularly after the Venezuelan failed
   coup attempt in 2002 against Chavez, tensions between the countries
   escalated, reaching a high in September 2008 when Venezuela broke off
   diplomatic relations with the US. Relations showed signs of improvement
   in 2009 with the election of the new US President Barack Obama,
   including the re-establishment of diplomatic relations in June 2009.

Caribbean[edit]

   The term "Caribbean" is used loosely to refer to countries in or near
   the Caribbean Sea other than those included under "Latin America".

   Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959 relations deteriorated
   substantially, and have since been marked by tension and confrontation.
   The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba
   and has maintained an embargo which makes it illegal for U.S.
   corporations to do business with Cuba. U.S. diplomatic representation
   in Cuba is handled by the United States Interests Section in Havana and
   a similar Cuban Interests Section remains in Washington, D.C.; both are
   officially part of the respective embassies of Switzerland. The United
   States has stated it will continue the embargo so long as the Cuban
   regime continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater
   respect for human rights,^[52] hoping to see democratization that took
   place in Eastern Europe.

   with the One China policy. The U.S. continued to provide Taiwan with
   military aid after 1979, and continued informal relations through the
   American Institute in Taiwan.

Southeast Asia[edit]

   Country Formal Relations Began Notes
    Brunei 1984^[68] See Brunei–United States relations

   The U.S. welcomed Brunei Darussalam's full independence from the United
   Kingdom on January 1, 1984, and opened an embassy in Bandar Seri
   Begawan on that date. Brunei opened its embassy in Washington, D.C. in
   March 1984. Brunei's armed forces engage in joint exercises, training
   programs, and other military cooperation with the U.S. A memorandum of
   understanding on defense cooperation was signed on November 29, 1994.
   The Sultan of Brunei visited Washington in December 2002.
    Burma 1948^[69] See Burma–United States relations

   The political relationship between the United States and Burma worsened
   after the 1988 military coup and violent suppression of pro-democracy
   demonstrations. Subsequent repression, including the brutal crackdown
   on peaceful protestors in September 2007, further strained the
   relationship. After 2010 elections and reforms started by President
   Than Sein and subsequent endorsement of reforms by leader of National
   League for Democracy (NLD) Aung San Suu Kyi and participation in April
   2012 by-elections to parliament has led to thawing of relationship with
   United States President Barack Obama visiting Burma a first by United

    Malaysia 1957^[73] See Malaysia–United States relations
    Philippines 1946^[74] See Philippines–United States relations

   The Philippines and the United States have an extremely strong
   relationship with each other due to their long standing alliance. The
   Philippines was also a US colony from 1902-1946. The Philippines is
   also the oldest and one of the closest US allies in Asia.^[75]

   The US and the Philippines have fought together in many conflicts such
   as World War I, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, Islamic
   insurgency in the Philippines, Gulf War and the War on Terror.

   The Philippines and the United States still maintain close, friendly,
   diplomatic, political and military relations with 100,000+ US citizens
   and nationals living in the Philippines and more than 2 million
   Filipinos living in the United States. Both countries actively
   cooperate in the trade, investment and financial sectors. The US is
   also the largest investor in the Philippine economy with an estimated
   total worth of $63 billion.

   The United States and the Philippines conduct joint military exercises
   called the Balikatan that take place once a year to boost relations
   between the two countries. The US military also conduct humanitarian
   and aid missions in the Philippines. The Philippines is one out of two
   major US allies in South East Asia.
    Singapore 1965^[76] See Singapore–United States relations
    Thailand 1833^[77] See Thailand–United States relations
    Vietnam 1995^[78] See United States–Vietnam relations

   After a 20-year hiatus of severed ties, President Bill Clinton
   announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam
   on July 11, 1995. Subsequent to President Clinton's normalization
   announcement, in August 1995, both nations upgraded their Liaison
   Offices opened during January 1995 to embassy status. As diplomatic
   ties between the nations grew, the United States opened a consulate
   general in Ho Chi Minh City, and Vietnam opened a consulate in San
   Francisco.

   Development and Denial of space for terrorism. The United States is
   closely working with Bangladesh in combating Islamic extremism and
   terrorism and is providing hundreds of millions of dollars every year
   in economic assistance.
    Bhutan N/A (Informal relations)^[81] See Bhutan–United States

   The U.S. Embassy, USAID, and the Peace Corps are located in Ashgabat,
   Turkmenistan. The United States and Turkmenistan continue to disagree
   about the country's path toward democratic and economic reform. The
   United States has publicly advocated industrial privatization, market
   liberalization, and fiscal reform, as well as legal and regulatory
   reforms to open up the economy to foreign trade and investment, as the
   best way to achieve prosperity and true independence and sovereignty.
    Uzbekistan 1991^[91] See United States–Uzbekistan relations

   Relations improved slightly in the latter half of 2007, but the U.S.
   continues to call for Uzbekistan to meet all of its commitments under
   the March 2002 Declaration of Strategic Partnership between the two
   countries. The declaration covers not only security and economic
   relations but political reform, economic reform, and human rights.
   Uzbekistan has Central Asia's largest population and is vital to U.S.,
   regional, and international efforts to promote stability and security.

   Relationship.

North Africa and Middle East[edit]

   The United States and the Kingdom of Persia recognized each other in
   1850. Diplomatic relations were established in 1883 and severed in
   1980.^[144]
   Country Formal Relations Began Notes
    Arab League See Arab–American relations

   The Arab League has an Embassy, and several Offices in the US.
    Algeria 1962^[140] See Algeria–United States relations

   The official U.S. presence in Algeria is expanding following over a
   decade of limited staffing, reflecting the general improvement in the
   security environment. During the past three years, the U.S. Embassy has
   moved toward more normal operations and now provides most embassy
   services to the American and Algerian communities.
    Azerbaijan 1991^[141] See Azerbaijan–United States relations
    Bahrain 1971^[142] See Bahrain–United States relations
    Egypt 1922^[143] See Egypt–United States relations

   After the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Egyptian foreign policy began to shift
   as a result of the change in Egypt's leadership from President Gamal
   Abdel-Nasser to Anwar Sadat and the emerging peace process between
   Egypt and Israel. Sadat realized that reaching a settlement of the
   Arab-Israeli conflict is a precondition for Egyptian development. To
   achieve this goal, Sadat ventured to enhance US-Egyptian relations to
   foster a peace process with Israel.

   In 2011, the United States cut diplomatic relations with the Gaddafi
   regime. The United States recognized the National Transitional Council
   as the legitimate government of Libya on July 15, 2011.^[151]
    Morocco 1905^[152] See Morocco–United States relations

   Morocco was the first sovereign nation to recognize the United States
   of America in 1777. American-Moroccan relations were formalized in a
   1787 treaty, which is still in force and is the oldest unbroken
   bilateral treaty in American history.

    United Arab Emirates 1972^[160] See United Arab Emirates–United States
   relations

   The United States was the third country to establish formal diplomatic
   relations with the UAE and has had an ambassador resident in the UAE
   since 1974. The two countries have enjoyed friendly relations with each
   other and have developed into friendly government-to-government ties
   which include security assistance. UAE and US had enjoyed private
   commercial ties, especially in petroleum. The quality of US-UAE
   relations increased dramatically as a result of the US-led coalition's
   campaign to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. UAE ports host more
   U.S. Navy ships than any port outside the US.
    Yemen 1946^[161] See United States–Yemen relations

   Traditionally, United States – Yemen relations have been tepid, as the
   lack of strong military-to-military ties, commercial relations, and
   support of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has hindered the
   development of strong bilateral ties. During the early years of the
   George W. Bush administration, relations improved under the rubric of
   the War on Terror, though Yemen's lack of policies toward wanted
   terrorists has stalled additional US support.^[162]

Sub-Saharan Africa[edit]

   Country Formal Relations Began Notes
    Angola 1994^[163] See Angola–United States relations

   Relations were tense during the Angolan Civil War when the U.S.
   government backed UNITA rebels, but have warmed since the Angolan
   government renounced Marxism in 1992.
    Benin 1960^[164] See United States–Benin relations

   The two nations have had an excellent history of relations in the years
   since Benin embraced democracy. The U.S. Government continues to assist
   Benin with the improvement of living standards that are key to the
   ultimate success of Benin's experiment with democratic government and
   economic liberalization, and are consistent with U.S. values and
   national interest in reducing poverty and promoting growth. The bulk of
   the U.S. effort in support of consolidating democracy in Benin is
   focused on long-term human resource development through U.S. Agency for
   International Development (USAID) programs.^[165]

   Bilateral relations between the United States and Uganda have been good
   since Yoweri Museveni assumed power, and the United States has welcomed
   his efforts to end human rights abuses and to pursue economic reform.
   Uganda is a strong supporter of the Global War on Terror. The United
   States is helping Uganda achieve export-led economic growth through the
   African Growth and Opportunity Act and provides a significant amount of
   development assistance. At the same time, the United States is
   concerned about continuing human rights problems and the pace of
   progress toward the establishment of genuine political pluralism.
    Zambia 1964^[211] See United States–Zambia relations

   The diplomatic relationship between the United States and Zambia can be
   characterized as warm and cooperative. The United States works closely
   with the Zambian Government to defeat the HIV/AIDS pandemic that is
   ravaging Zambia, to promote economic growth and development, and to
   effect political reform needed to promote responsive and responsible
   government. The United States is also supporting the government's
   efforts to root out corruption. Zambia is a beneficiary of the African
   Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The U.S. Government provides a
   variety of technical assistance and other support that is managed by
   the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International
   Development, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Threshold Program,
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of
   Treasury, U.S. Department of Defense, and Peace Corps. The majority of
   U.S. assistance is provided through the President's Emergency Plan for
   AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), in support of the fight against HIV/AIDS.
    Zimbabwe 1980^[212] See United States–Zimbabwe relations

   After Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe's rival and leader of the Movement for
   Democratic Change, became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe under a
   power-sharing agreement, the Barack Obama administration extended its
   congratulations to Tsvangirai, but said that the U.S. would wait for
   evidence of Mugabe's cooperation with the MDC before it would consider
   lifting its sanctions.^[213] In early March 2009, Obama proclaimed that
   US sanctions would be protracted provisionally for another year,
   because Zimbabwe's political crisis is as yet unresolved.^[214]
