   Total incarceration in the United States by year
   A graph showing the incarceration rate under state and federal
   jurisdiction per 100,000 population 1925–2008. Does not include
   prisoners held in the custody of local jails, inmates out to court, and
   those in transit.^[1] The male incarceration rate is roughly 15 times
   the female incarceration rate.
   Inmates held in custody in state or federal prisons or in local jails,
   December 31, 2000, and 2009–2010.^[2]

   Incarceration in the United States of America is one of the main forms
   of punishment, rehabilitation, or both for the commission of felony and
   other offenses. The United States has the highest documented
   incarceration rate in the world. At year-end 2009, it was 743 adults
   incarcerated per 100,000 population.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7]

   According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 2,266,800
   adults were incarcerated in U.S. federal and state prisons, and county
   jails at year-end 2011 – about 0.94% of adults in the U.S. resident
   population.^[4] Additionally, 4,814,200 adults at year-end 2011 were on
   probation or on parole.^[8] In total, 6,977,700 adults were under
   correctional supervision (probation, parole, jail, or prison) in 2011 –
   about 2.9% of adults in the U.S. resident population.^[8] A 2014 report
   published by the National Research Council asserts that the prison
   population of the United States "is by far the largest in the world.
   Just under one-quarter of the world's prisoners are held in American
   prisons."^[9]

   In addition, there were 70,792 juveniles in juvenile detention in
   2010.^[10]

   Although debtor's prisons no longer exist in the United States,
   residents of some U.S. states can still be incarcerated for debt as of
   2014.^[11]^[12]^[13]

   According to a 2014 report by Human Rights Watch, "tough-on-crime" laws
   adopted since the 1980s have filled U.S. prisons with mostly nonviolent
   offenders.^[14]

History[edit]

   Main article: History of United States prison systems
   [icon] This section requires expansion. (July 2014)

   In 1841, Dorothea Dix discovered that prison conditions were, in her
   opinion, inhumane. Prisoners were chained naked, whipped with rods.
   Others, criminally insane, were caged, or placed in cellars, or
   closets. She insisted on changes throughout the rest of her life. While
   focusing on the insane, her comments also resulted in changes for other
   inmates.^[15]

Prison population[edit]

   On January 1, 2008 more than 1 in 100 adults in the United States were
   in prison or jail.^[16]^[17]
      USA and territories.^[18]

                                   inmates
                                   in 2008
   Total                           2,418,352
   Federal and state prisons       1,518,559
   Territorial prisons                13,576
   Local jails                       785,556
   ICE facilities                      9,957
   Military facilities                 1,651
   Jails in tribal territories         2,135
   Juvenile facilities (2007)^[10]    86,927

   In 2008 approximately one in every 31 adults (7.3 million) in the
   United States was behind bars, or being monitored (probation and
   parole). In 2008 the breakdown for adults under correctional control
   was as follows: one out of 18 men, one in 89 women, one in 11
   African-Americans (9.2 percent), one in 27 Latinos (3.7 percent), and
   one in 45 Caucasians (2.2 percent). Crime rates have decreased by about
   25 percent from 1988 to 2008.^[19] In recent decades the U.S. has
   experienced a surge in its prison population, quadrupling since 1980,
   partially as a result of mandatory sentencing that came about during
   the "war on drugs." Violent crime and property crime have declined
   since the early 1990s.^[20]

   In addition, there were 86,927 held in juvenile facilities as of the
   2007 Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP), conducted by
   the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.^[10]^[18]

   America's foster youth represent a large number of the incarcerated. In
   California, 70% of prisoners spent time in foster care
   system.^[citation needed]

   As of 2009, the three states with the lowest ratios of imprisoned
   people per 100,000 population are Maine (150 per 100,000), Minnesota
   (189 per 100,000), and New Hampshire (206 per 100,000). The three
   states with the highest ratio are Louisiana (881 per 100,000),
   Mississippi (702 per 100,000) and Oklahoma (657 per 100,000).^[21]

   In 2009, 92.9% of prisoners (not jail inmates) were male.^[21]

   A 2005 report estimated that 27% of federal prison inmates are
   noncitizens, convicted of crimes while in the country legally or
   illegally.^[22] However, federal prison inmates account for six percent
   of the total incarcerated population; noncitizen populations in state
   and local prisons are more difficult to establish. The World Prison
   Brief puts the total number of foreign prisoners in all federal, state
   and local facilities at 5.9%.^[6]

Duration[edit]

   Main article: Criminal sentencing in the United States

   Many legislatures continually have reduced discretion of judges in both
   the sentencing process and the determination of when the conditions of
   a sentence have been satisfied. Determinate sentencing, use of
   mandatory minimums, and guidelines-based sentencing continue to remove
   the human element from sentencing, such as the prerogative of the judge
   to consider the mitigating or extenuating circumstances of a crime to
   determine the appropriate length of the incarceration. As the
   consequence of "three strikes laws," the increase in the duration of
   incarceration in the last decade was most pronounced in the case of
   life prison sentences, which increased by 83% between 1992 and 2003
   while violent crimes fell in the same period.^[23]

Violent and nonviolent crime[edit]

   In 2008, there were 198.2 violent crimes reported per 100,000
   persons.^[24]

   In 2008, there were over 14 million people arrested for violent and
   non-violent crime.^[24]

   7.9% of sentenced prisoners in federal prisons on September 30, 2009
   were in for violent crimes.^[21] 52.4% of sentenced prisoners in state
   prisons at year end 2008 were in for violent crimes.^[21] 21.6% of
   convicted inmates in jails in 2002 (latest available data by type of
   offense) were in for violent crimes. Among unconvicted inmates in jails
   in 2002, 34% had a violent offense as the most serious charge. 41%
   percent of convicted and unconvicted jail inmates in 2002 had a current
   or prior violent offense; 46% were nonviolent recidivists. ^[25]

   From 2000 to 2008, the state prison population increased by 159,200
   prisoners, and violent offenders accounted for 60% of this increase.
   The number of drug offenders in state prisons declined by 12,400 over
   this period. Furthermore, while the number of sentenced violent
   offenders in state prison increased from 2000 through 2008, the
   expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during
   this period.^[21]

   Violent crime was not responsible for the quadrupling of the
   incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003. Violent
   crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those
   decades. The prison population was increased primarily by public policy
   changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served, e.g.
   through mandatory minimum sentencing, "three strikes" laws, and
   reductions in the availability of parole or early release. 49 percent
   of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses. Perhaps the
   single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has
   been the national "war on drugs." The number of incarcerated drug
   offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980. In 2000, 22 percent of
   those in federal and state prisons were convicted on drug charges.
   ^[26]^[27] In 2011, 55.6% of the 1,131,210 sentenced prisoners in state
   prisons were being held for violent crimes (this number excludes the
   200,966 prisoners being held due parole violations, of which 39.6% were
   re-incarcerated for a subsequent violent crime).^[28] Also in 2011,
   3.7% of the state prison population consisted of prisoners whose
   highest conviction was for drug possession (again excluding those
   incarcerated for parole violations of which 6.0% were re-incarcerated
   for a subsequent act of drug possession).^[28]

Recidivism[edit]

   Main article: Recidivism in the United States

   A 2002 study survey showed that among nearly 275,000 prisoners released
   in 1994, 67.5% were rearrested within 3 years, and 51.8% were back in
   prison.^[29] However, the study found no evidence that spending more
   time in prison raises the recidivism rate, and found that those serving
   the longest time, 61 months or more, had a slightly lower re-arrest
   rate (54.2%) than every other category of prisoners. This is most
   likely explained by the older average age of those released with the
   longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation
   between recidivism and age upon release.

Comparison with other countries[edit]

   The stats source is the World Prison Population List. 8th edition.
   Prisoners per 100,000 population.^[5]^[30]^[31]
   See also: List of countries by incarceration rate

   The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate in the
   world (743 per 100,000 population), Russia has the second highest rate
   (577 per 100,000), followed by Rwanda (561 per 100,000).^[5] As of
   year-end 2009 the USA rate was 743 adults incarcerated in prisons and
   jails per 100,000 population.^[3]^[5] At year-end 2007 the United
   States had less than 5% of the world's population^[32] and 23.4% of the
   world's prison and jail population (adult inmates).^[6]

   By comparison the incarceration rate in England and Wales in October
   2011 was 155 people imprisoned per 100,000 residents;^[33] the rate for
   Norway in May 2010 was 71 inmates per 100,000;^[34] Netherlands in
   April 2010 was 94 per 100,000;^[35] Australia in June 2010 was 133 per
   100,000;^[36] and New Zealand in October 2010 was 203 per 100,000.^[37]

   A 2008 New York Times article^[38] said that "it is the length of
   sentences that truly distinguishes American prison policy. Indeed, the
   mere number of sentences imposed here would not place the United States
   at the top of the incarceration lists. If lists were compiled based on
   annual admissions to prison per capita, several European countries
   would outpace the United States. But American prison stays are much
   longer, so the total incarceration rate is higher."
   In 2007, the United States topped the list of countries by
   incarceration rate

Race[edit]

   the American criminal justice system
   On June 30, 2006, an estimated 4.8% of black non-Hispanic men were in
   prison or jail, compared to 1.9% of Hispanic men of any race and 0.7%
   of white non-Hispanic men. U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.^[39]

   Hispanic of any race 1,775 133    -
   All inmates          1,352 126    732

   According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) non-Hispanic
   blacks accounted for 39.4% of the total prison and jail population in
   2009 (841,000 black males and 64,800 black females out of a total of
   2,096,300 males and 201,200 females).^[41] According to the 2010 census
   of the US Census Bureau blacks (including Hispanic blacks) comprised
   13.6% of the US population.^[42]^[43]^[44]

   Hispanics (of all races) were 20.6% of the total jail and prison
   population in 2009.^[41] Hispanics comprised 16.3% of the US population
   according to the 2010 US census.^[42]^[45] The Northeast has the
   highest incarceration rates of Hispanics in the nation.^[46]
   Connecticut has the highest Hispanic-to-White incarceration ratio with
   6.6 Hispanic males for every white male. The National Average
   Hispanic-to-White incarceration ratio is 1.8. Other states with high
   Hispanic-to-White incarcerations include Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,
   and New York.^[47]

   As the Hispanic community is not monolithic, variations are seen in
   incarceration rates. Among the Hispanic community, Puerto Ricans have
   the highest incarceration rate. Located primarily in the Northeast and
   mid-Atlantic states, they are up to six times more likely to be
   incarcerated than whites, which may explain the higher incarceration
   rates for Hispanics overall in the Northeast
   region.^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]^[56] Illegal
   immigrants, usually Mexican nationals, also make up a substantial
   number of Hispanics incarcerated.^[57]^[58]^[59]

   In 2010 black non-Hispanic males were incarcerated at the rate of 4,347
   inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents of the same race and gender. White
   males were incarcerated at the rate of 678 inmates per 100,000 U.S.
   residents. Hispanic males were incarcerated at the rate of 1,755
   inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents.^[40]^[60] (For female rates see the
   table below.) Asian Americans, however, have lower incarceration rates
   than any other racial group, including whites.^[61]

   Black majority cities have similar crime statistics for blacks as do
   cities where majority of population is white. For example,
   white-majority San Diego has a slightly lower crime rate for blacks
   than does Atlanta, a city which has black majority in population and
   city government.^[62]

   In 2013, by age 18, 30% of black males, 26% of Hispanic males, and 22%
   of white males have been arrested. By age 23, 49% of black males, 44%
   of Hispanic males, and 38% of white males have been arrested.^[63]

Women[edit]

   Main article: Incarceration of women in the United States

   As of December 31, 2009 the female prison population of federal and
   state prisons in the United States was 113,462.^[64] Within the US, the
   rate of female incarceration increased fivefold in a two decade span
   ending in 2001; the increase occurred because of increased prosecutions
   and convictions of offenses related to recreational drugs, increases in
   the severities of offenses, and a lack of community sanctions and
   treatment for women who violate laws.^[65] In the United States,
   authorities began housing women in correctional facilities separate
   from men in the 1870s.^[66]

   Main article: Youth incarceration in the United States

   Through the juvenile courts and the adult criminal justice system, the
   United States incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in
   the world, a reflection of the larger trends in incarceration practices
   in the United States. This has been a source of controversy for a
   number of reasons, including the overcrowding and violence in youth
   detention facilities, the prosecution of youths as adults and the long
   term consequences of incarceration on the individual's chances for
   success in adulthood. In 2014, the United Nations Human Rights
   Committee criticized the United States for about ten judicial abuses,
   including the mistreatment of juvenile inmates.^[67]

   According to federal data from 2011, around 40% of the nation’s
   juvenile inmates are housed in private facilities.^[68]

Aged[edit]

   The percentage of prisoners in federal and state prisons aged 55 and
   older increased by 33% from 2000 to 2005 while the prison population
   grew by 8%. The Southern Legislative Conference found that in 16
   southern states the elderly prisoner population increased on average by
   145% between 1997 and 2007. The growth in the elderly population
   brought along higher health care costs, most notably seen in the 10%
   average increase in state prison budgets from 2005 to 2006.

   The SLC expects the percentage of elderly prisoners relative to the
   overall prison population to continue to rise. Ronald Aday, a professor
   of aging studies at Middle Tennessee State University and author of
   Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections, concurs. One out of
   six prisoners in California is serving a life sentence. Aday predicts
   that by 2020 16% percent of those serving life sentences will be
   elderly.^[69]^[70]

   State governments pay all of their inmates' housing costs which
   significantly increase as prisoners age. Inmates are unable to apply
   for Medicare and Medicaid. Most Departments of Correction report
   spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly
   care.^[69]^[70]

   The American Civil Liberties Union published a report in 2012 which
   asserts that the elderly prison population has climbed 1300% since the
   1980s, with 125,000 inmates aged 55 or older now incarcerated.^[71]

Security levels[edit]

   In various, but not all, states' department of corrections, inmates
   reside in different facilities that vary by security level, especially
   in security measures, administration of inmates, type of housing, and
   weapons and tactics used by corrections officers. The federal
   government's Bureau of Prisons uses a numbered scale from one to five
   to represent the security level. Level five is the most secure, while
   level one is the least. State prison systems operate similar systems.
   California, for example, classifies its facilities from Reception
   Center through Levels I to V (minimum to maximum security) to
   specialized high security units (all considered Level V) including
   Security Housing Unit (SHU)—California's version of supermax—and
   related units. As a general rule, county jails, detention centers, and
   reception centers, where new commitments are first held while either
   awaiting trial or before being transferred to "mainline" institutions
   to serve out their sentences, operate at a relatively high level of
   security, usually close security or higher.

   Supermax prison facilities provide the highest level of prison
   security. These units hold those considered the most dangerous inmates,
   as well as inmates that have been deemed too high-profile or too great
   a national security risk for a normal prison. These include inmates who
   have committed assaults, murders, or other serious violations in less
   secure facilities, and inmates known to be or accused of being prison
   gang members.^[72] Most states have either a supermax section of a
   prison facility or an entire prison facility designated as a supermax.
   The United States Federal Bureau of Prisons operates a federal
   supermax, ADX Florence, located in Florence, Colorado, also known as
   the "Alcatraz of the Rockies" and widely considered to be perhaps the
   most secure prison in the United States.^[72] ADX Florence has a
   standard supermax section where assaultive, violent, and gang-related
   inmates are kept under normal supermax conditions of 23-hour
   confinement and abridged amenities. ADX Florence is considered to be of
   a security level above that of all other prisons in the United States,
   at least in the "ideological" ultramax part of it, which features
   permanent, 24-hour solitary confinement with rare human contacts or
   opportunity to earn better conditions through good behavior.^[72]

   In a maximum security prison or area, all prisoners have individual
   cells with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control
   station.^[72] Prisoners are allowed out of their cells one out of
   twenty four hours (one hour and 30 minutes for prisoners in
   California). When out of their cells, prisoners remain in the cell
   block or an exterior cage. Movement out of the cell block or "pod" is
   tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional
   officers.^[72]

   Under close security, prisoners usually have one- or two-person cells
   operated from a remote control station. Each cell has its own toilet
   and sink.^[72] Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or
   correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in
   the cellblock or an exercise yard. The fences are generally double
   fences with watchtowers housing armed guards, plus often a third,
   lethal-current electric fence in the middle.^[72]

   Prisoners that fall into the medium security group may sleep in
   dormitories on bunk beds with lockers to store their possessions.^[72]
   They may have communal showers, toilets and sinks. Dormitories are
   locked at night with one or more correctional officers supervising.
   There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The
   perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.^[72]

   Prisoners in minimum security facilities are considered to pose little
   physical risk to the public and are mainly non-violent "white collar
   criminals". Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories,
   which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers.^[72] As in
   medium security facilities, they have communal showers, toilets, and
   sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is
   watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very
   remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may
   often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with
   the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many
   minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military
   bases, larger prisons (outside the security perimeter) or other
   government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor
   to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security
   facilities access to the Internet.^[72]

Correspondence[edit]

   Research indicates that inmates who maintain contact with family and
   friends in the outside world are less likely to be convicted of further
   crimes and usually have an easier reintegration period back into
   society.^[citation needed] Many institutions encourage friends and
   families to send letters, especially when they are unable to visit
   regularly. However, guidelines exist as to what constitutes acceptable
   mail, and these policies are strictly enforced.

   Mail sent to inmates in violation of prison policies can cost inmates
   "gain time"^[clarification needed] and even lead to punishment. Most
   Department of Corrections websites provide detailed information
   regarding mail policies. These rules can even vary within a single
   prison depending on which part of the prison an inmate is housed. For
   example, death row and maximum security inmates are usually under
   stricter mail guidelines for security reasons.

   There have been several notable challenges to prison corresponding
   services. The Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC) stated that
   effective June 1, 2007, inmates would be prohibited from using pen pal
   websites, citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money
   and defraud the public.^[73] Service providers such as
   WriteAPrisoner.com, together with the ACLU, plan to challenge the ban
   in Federal Court. Similar bans on an inmate's rights or a website's
   right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other
   courts, citing First Amendment freedoms.^[74] Some faith-based
   initiatives promote the positive effects of correspondence on inmates,
   and some have made efforts to help ex-offenders reintegrate into
   society through job placement assistance.^[75] Inmates' ability to mail
   letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts.^[76] Inmate
   correspondence with members of society is typically encouraged because
   of the positive impact it can have on inmates, albeit under the
   guidelines of each institution and availability of letter
   writers.^[citation needed]

   The non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch raised concerns
   with prisoner rape and medical care for inmates.^[78] In a survey of
   1,788 male inmates in Midwestern prisons by Prison Journal, about 21%
   responded they had been coerced or pressured into sexual activity
   during their incarceration, and 7% that they had been raped in their
   current facility.^[79]

   In August 2003, a Harper's article by Wil S. Hylton estimated that
   "somewhere between 20 and 40% of American prisoners are, at this very
   moment, infected with hepatitis C".^[80] Prisons may outsource medical
   care to private companies such as Correctional Medical Services (now
   Corizon) that, according to Hylton's research, try to minimize the
   amount of care given to prisoners in order to maximize
   profits.^[80]^[81] After the privatization of healthcare in Arizona's
   prisons, medical spending fell by 30 million dollars and staffing was
   greatly reduced. Some 50 prisoners died in custody in the first 8
   months of 2013, compared to 37 for the preceding two years
   combined.^[82]

   The poor quality of food provided to inmates has become an issue, as
   over the last decade corrections officials looking to cut costs have
   been outsourcing food services to private, for profit corporations such
   as Aramark, A’Viands Food & Services Management, and ABL
   Management.^[83] A prison riot in Kentucky has been blamed on the low
   quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.^[84]

   Also identified as an issue within the prison system is gang violence,
   because many gang members retain their gang identity and affiliations
   when imprisoned. Segregation of identified gang members from the
   general population of inmates, with different gangs being housed in
   separate units often results in the imprisonment of these gang members
   with their friends and criminal cohorts. Some feel this has the effect
   of turning prisons into "institutions of higher criminal
   learning."^[85]

   Many prisons in the United States are overcrowded. For example,
   California's 33 prisons have a total capacity of 100,000, but they hold
   170,000 inmates.^[86] Many prisons in California and around the country
   are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses
   for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one
   another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates
   separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this
   situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to
   increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a
   week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release
   27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment's
   prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.^[87] The three-judge court
   considering requests by the Plata v. Schwarzenegger and Coleman v.
   Schwarzenegger courts found California's prisons have become
   criminogenic as a result of prison overcrowding.^[88]

   In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Cutter v. Wilkinson established
   that prisons that received federal funds could not deny prisoners
   accommodations necessary for religious practices.

   According to a Supreme Court ruling issued on May 23, 2011, California
   — which has the highest overcrowding rate of any prison system in the
   country — must alleviate overcrowding in the state's prisons, reducing
   the prisoner population by 30,000 over the next two years.^[89]^[90]

   Solitary confinement is widely used in US prisons, yet it is
   underreported by most states, while some don't report it at all.
   Isolation of prisoners has been condemned by the UN in 2011 as a form
   of torture. At over 80,000 at any given time, the US has more prisoners
   confined in isolation than any other country in the world. In
   Louisiana, with 843 prisoners per 100,000 citizens, there have been
   prisoners, such as the Angola Three, held for as long as forty years in
   isolation.^[91]^[92]

   In 1999, the Supreme Court of Norway refused to extradite American
   hashish-smuggler Henry Hendricksen, as they declared that US prisons do
   not meet their minimum humanitarian standards.^[93]

   In 2011, some 885 people died while being held in local jails (not in
   prisons after being convicted of a crime and sentenced) throughout the
   United States.^[94]

   As of September 2013, condoms for prisoners are only available in the
   US state of Vermont (on September 17, 2013, the California Senate
   approved a bill for condom distribution inside the state's prisons, but
   the bill was not yet law at the time of approval).^[95]

Privatization[edit]

   Main article: Private prisons in the United States

   In recent years, there has been much debate over the privatization of
   prisons. Both publicly provided and publicly financed prisons operate
   under the titular supervision of the various Departments of Corrections
   that exist at the state and the Bureau of Prisons at the federal level.

   A study was performed using three comparable Louisiana medium security
   prisons, two of which were privately run by different corporations and
   the third was publicly run. The authors report the data from this study
   suggests the privately run prisons operated more cost effectively
   without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. They conclude the
   privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, fewer critical
   incidents, safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher
   proportional rate of inmates who complete basic education, literacy,
   and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison
   outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as fewer escape
   attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offered a wider
   range of educational and vocational courses, and provided a broader
   range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative
   services.^[96]

   The results of this study show why this issue is complicated without an
   obvious solution. The privately run prisons were found to be a cheaper
   alternative without diminishing the level of safety and generating a
   higher completion rate of the offered educational/vocational programs.
   But, the publicly run prison offered more services that suggest a
   larger commitment beyond guarding and housing inmates.

   In neighboring Mississippi, a 2013 Bloomberg report states that assault
   rates in private facilities were three times higher on average than in
   their public counterparts. In 2012, the for-profit Walnut Grove Youth
   Correctional Facility was the most violent prison in the state, and had
   27 assaults per 100 offenders.^[97] A May 2012 riot in the CCA-run
   Adams County Correctional Facility, also in Mississippi, left one
   corrections officer dead and dozens injured. Similar riots have
   occurred in privatized facilities in Idaho, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
   Florida and California.^[98]^[99]

   According to the American Civil Liberties Union, numerous other studies
   indicate that private jails are actually filthier, more violent, less
   accountable, and could be more costly than their public counterparts.
   They claim that the for-profit prison industry is "a major contributor
   to bloated state budgets and mass incarceration – not a part of any
   viable solution to these urgent problems."^[100] In fact, the primary
   reason Louisiana is the prison capital of the world is because of the
   for-profit prison industry. According to The Times-Picayune, "a
   majority of Louisiana inmates are housed in for-profit facilities,
   which must be supplied with a constant influx of human beings or a
   $182 million industry will go bankrupt."^[101]

   Controversy has surrounded the privatization of prisons with the
   exposure of the genesis of the landmark Arizona SB 1070 law. This law
   was written by Arizona State Congressman Russell Pearce and the
   Corrections Corporation of America at a meeting of the American
   Legislative Exchange Council in the Grand Hyatt in Washington,
   D.C.^[102]

   Companies operating in the private prison business include the
   Corrections Corporation of America, the GEO Group, Inc., Management and
   Training Corporation, and Community Education Centers. The GEO Group
   was formerly known as the Wackenhut Corrections division. It includes
   the former Correctional Services Corporation and Cornell Companies,
   which were purchased by GEO in 2005 and 2010. Such companies often sign
   contracts with states obliging them to fill prison beds or reimburse
   them for those that go unused.^[103]

   Private companies which provide services to prisons combine in the
   American Correctional Association, a 501(c)3 which advocates
   legislation favorable to the industry. Such private companies comprise
   what has been termed the Prison-industrial complex.^[104]^[105] An
   example of this phenomenon would be the Kids for cash scandal, in which
   two judges in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, Mark Ciavarella and Michael
   Conahan, were receiving judicial kickbacks for sending youths,
   convicted of minor crimes,^[106] to a privatized, for-profit juvenile
   facility run by the Mid Atlantic Youth Service Corporation.^[107]

Employment[edit]

   About 18% of eligible prisoners held in federal prisons are employed by
   UNICOR and are paid less than $1.25 an hour.^[108]^[109]^[110]

   It is estimated that 1 in 9 state government employees works in
   corrections.^[111] As the overall U.S. prison population declined in
   2010, states are closing prisons. For instance, Virginia has removed 11
   prisons since 2009. Like other small towns, Boydton in Virginia has to
   contend with unemployment woes resulting from the closure of the
   Mecklenburg Correctional Center.^[112]

Cost[edit]

   U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Not adjusted for inflation. To view
   the inflation-adjusted data:^[113]

   In 2007, around $74 billion was spent on corrections.^[113] The total
   number of inmates in 2007 in federal, state, and local lockups was
   2,419,241.^[18] That comes to around $30,600 per inmate.

   In 2005, it cost an average of $23,876 dollars per state prisoner.
   State prison spending varied widely, from $45,000 a year in Rhode
   Island to $13,000 in Louisiana.^[16]^[111]

   In California in 2008, it cost the state an average of $47,102 a year
   to incarcerate an inmate in a state prison. From 2001 to 2009, the
   average annual cost increased by about $19,500.^[114]

   In 2003 among facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, it
   cost $25,327 per inmate.^[115]

   Housing the approximately 500,000 people in jail in the USA awaiting
   trial who cannot afford bail costs $9 billion a year.^[116] Most jail
   inmates are petty, nonviolent offenders. Twenty years ago most
   nonviolent defendants were released on their own recognizance (trusted
   to show up at trial). Now most are given bail, and most pay a bail
   bondsman to afford it.^[117] 62% of local jail inmates are awaiting
   trial.^[118]

   To ease jail overcrowding over 10 counties every year consider building
   new jails. As an example Lubbock County, Texas has decided to build a
   $110 million megajail to ease jail overcrowding. Jail costs an average
   of $60 a day nationally.^[117]^[119] In Broward County, Florida
   supervised pretrial release costs about $7 a day per person while jail
   costs $115 a day. The jail system costs a quarter of every county tax
   dollar in Broward County, and is the single largest expense to the
   county taxpayer.^[120]

     Bondsmen have lobbied to cut back local pretrial programs from Texas
     to California, pushed for legislation in four states limiting
     pretrial's resources, and lobbied Congress so that they won't have
     to pay the bond if the defendant commits a new crime. Behind them,
     the bondsmen have powerful special interest group and millions of
     dollars. Pretrial release agencies have a smattering of public
     employees and the remnants of their once-thriving programs.

   —National Public Radio, January 22, 2010.^[120]

   The National Association of State Budget Officers reports: "In fiscal
   2009, corrections spending represented 3.4 percent of total state
   spending and 7.2 percent of general fund spending." They also report:
   "Some states exclude certain items when reporting corrections
   expenditures. Twenty-one states wholly or partially excluded juvenile
   delinquency counseling from their corrections figures and fifteen
   states wholly or partially excluded spending on juvenile institutions.
   Seventeen states wholly or partially excluded spending on drug abuse
   rehabilitation centers and forty-one states wholly or partially
   excluded spending on institutions for the criminally insane. Twenty-two
   states wholly or partially excluded aid to local governments for jails.
   For details, see Table 36."^[121]

   As of 2007 the cost of medical care for inmates was growing by 10
   percent annually.^[16]^[111]

Criticism[edit]

   See also: United States incarceration rate § Causes, Torture in the
   United States § Domestic police and prisons and Human rights in the
   United States § Prison system

   High rates of incarceration may be due to sentence length, which is
   further driven by many other factors. Shorter sentences may even
   diminish the criminal culture by possibly reducing re-arrest rates for
   first-time convicts.^[122] The U.S. Congress has ordered federal judges
   to make imprisonment decisions "recognizing that imprisonment is not an
   appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation."^[123]

   Critics have lambasted the United States for incarcerating a large
   number of non-violent and victimless offenders;^[124]^[125] half of all
   persons incarcerated under state jurisdiction are for non-violent
   offenses, and 20% are incarcerated for drug offenses (in state prisons,
   federal prison percentages are higher).^[41]^[126] "Human Rights Watch
   believes the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States
   wreaks havoc on individuals, families and communities, and saps the
   strength of the nation as a whole."^[124] The population of inmates
   housed in prisons and jails in the United States exceeds 2 million,
   with the per capita incarceration population higher than that
   officially reported by any other country.^[111] Criminal justice policy
   in the United States has also been criticized for a number of other
   reasons.^[127] Critics such as Angela Davis have argued that prisons in
   the U.S. have "become venues of profit as well as punishment;" as mass
   incarceration has increased, the prison system has become more about
   economic factors than criminality.^[128] In the 2014 book The Divide:
   American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap, journalist Matt Taibbi
   argues that the expanding disparity of wealth and the increasing
   criminalization of those in poverty have culminated in the U.S. having
   the largest prison population "in the history of human
   civilization."^[129]

   Reporting at the annual meeting of the American Sociological
   Association (August 3, 2008), Becky Pettit, associate professor of
   sociology from the University of Washington and Bryan Sykes, a UW
   post-doctoral researcher, revealed that the mammoth increase in the
   United States's prison population since the 1970s is having profound
   demographic consequences that affect 1 in 50 Americans. Drawing data
   from a variety of sources that looked at prison and general
   populations, the researchers found that the boom in prison population
   is hiding lowered rates of fertility and increased rates of involuntary
   migration to rural areas and morbidity that is marked by a greater
   exposure to and risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and
   HIV or AIDS.^[130]

   Guilty plea bargains concluded 97% of all federal cases in 2011.^[131]

   As of December 2012, two state prison systems segregated prisoners
   based on their HIV status. On December 21, U.S. District Court Judge
   Myron Thompson ruled in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil
   Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of several inmates that Alabama's
   practice in doing so violated federal disabilities law. He noted the
   state's "outdated and unsupported assumptions about HIV and the prison
   system's ability to deal with HIV-positive prisoners." The other state
   with a similar segregation policy was South Carolina.^[132]

Department of Justice Smart on Crime Program[edit]

   On 12 August 2013, at the American Bar Association's House of Delegates
   meeting, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the "Smart on Crime"
   program, which is "a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that
   in effect renounces several decades of tough-on-crime anti-drug
   legislation and policies."^[133]^[134] Holder said the program "will
   encourage U.S. attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes "for
   which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual
   conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for
   violent criminals or drug kingpins…"^[133]^[134] Running through
   Holder's statements, the increasing economic burden of
   over-incarceration was stressed.^[133]^[134] As of August
   2013^[update], the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative
   initiative but an effort "limited to the DOJ's policy
   parameters."^[133]^[133]^[134]

Strip searches and cavity searches[edit]

   The procedural use of strip searches and cavity searches in the prison
   system has raised human rights concerns.^[135]

Federal prisons[edit]

   Further information: List of U.S. federal prisons

   The Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States
   Department of Justice, is responsible for the administration of United
   States federal prisons.

States and insular areas[edit]

   Main article: List of United States state correction agencies

   Imprisonment by the state judicial systems has steadily diminished
   since 2006 to 2012, from 689,536 annually to 553,843 annually.^[136]
