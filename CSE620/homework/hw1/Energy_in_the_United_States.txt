   United States energy consumption by sector in 2007

   The United States is the 2nd largest energy consumer in terms of total
   use in 2010.^[1] The U.S. ranks seventh in energy consumption
   per-capita after Canada and a number of small nations.^[2]^[3] Not
   included is the significant amount of energy used overseas in the
   production of retail and industrial goods consumed in the U.S.

   The majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels: in 2010, data
   showed 25% of the nation's energy came from petroleum, 22% from coal,
   and 22% from natural gas. Nuclear power supplied 8.4% and renewable
   energy supplied 8%,^[4] which was mainly from hydroelectric dams and
   Biomass but also included other renewable sources such as wind power,
   geothermal and solar energy.^[5] Energy consumption has increased at a
   faster rate than domestic energy production over the last fifty years
   in the U.S.(when they were roughly equal). This difference is now
   largely met through imports.^[6]

   According to the Energy Information Administration's statistics, the
   per-capita energy consumption in the US has been somewhat consistent
   from the 1970s to today. The average has been 334 million British
   thermal units (BTUs) per person from 1980 to 2010. One explanation
   suggested for this is that the energy required to produce the increase
   in US consumption of manufactured equipment, cars, and other goods has
   been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods
   to the US with a corresponding shift of green house gases and
   pollution. In comparison, the world average has increased from 63.7 in
   1980 to 75 million BTU's per person in 2008. On the other hand, US
   "off-shoring" of manufacturing is sometimes exaggerated: US domestic
   manufacturing has grown by 50% since 1980.^[citation needed]

History[edit]

   US energy consumption, by source, 1775-2010. Vertical axis is in
   quadrillion BTU

   From its founding until the late 18th century, the United States was a
   largely agrarian country with abundant forests. During this period,
   energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available
   firewood. Rapid industrialization of the economy, urbanization, and the
   growth of railroads led to increased use of coal, and by 1885 it had
   eclipsed wood as the nation's primary energy source.

   Coal remained dominant for the next 7 decades, but by 1950, it was
   surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas. In 2007, coal
   consumption was the highest it has ever been, with coal mostly being
   used to generate electricity.^[7] Natural gas, which is cleaner-burning
   and more easily transportable, has replaced coal as the preferred
   source of heating in homes, businesses and industrial furnaces.
   Although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of 50
   between 1850 and 2000, energy use per capita increased only by a factor
   of four. As of 2009, United States per capita energy use had declined
   to 7075 (kilograms of oil-equivalent), 12% less than 2000, and through
   2010 (most recent available) is at levels not seen since 1960s usage
   levels.^[8] At the beginning of the 20th century, petroleum was a minor
   resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil
   lamps. One hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy
   source for the U.S. and the rest of the world. This rise closely
   paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in American
   culture and the economy.

   While petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other
   chemicals, and powers various industrial processes, today two-thirds of
   oil consumption in the U.S. is in the form of its derived
   transportation fuels.^[9] Oil's unique qualities for transportation
   fuels in terms of energy content, cost of production, and speed of
   refueling all contributed to it being used over other fuels.

   In June 2010, the American Energy Innovation Council,^[10] (which
   includes Bill Gates, Microsoft; Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of
   General Electric; and John Doerr) has urged the government to more than
   triple spending on energy research and development, to $16 billion a
   year. Mr. Gates endorsed the administration’s goal of reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, but said that was not
   possible with today’s technology or politicism. He said that the only
   way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of
   money at the problem. The group notes that the federal government
   spends less than $5 billion a year on energy research and development,
   not counting one-time stimulus projects. About $30 billion is spent
   annually on health research and more than $80 billion on military R.&
   D. They advocate a jump in spending on basic energy research.^[11]
US CO2 emissions have dropped about 1% per year through greater efficiency and a
 sluggish economy since 2008.

Consumption by sector[edit]

   The U.S. Department of Energy tracks national energy consumption in
   four broad sectors: industrial, transportation, residential, and
   commercial. The industrial sector has long been the country's largest
   energy user, currently representing about 33% of the total. Next in
   importance is the transportation sector, followed by the residential
   and commercial sectors.

Regional variation[edit]

   Residential Energy Consumption per capita by State.^[22]
   US household energy usage.png
   Average annual residential electricity usage by city, 2000-2005.
   Measured in Kilowatt hours per customer.^[23]

   Household energy use varies significantly across the United States. An
   average home in the Pacific region (consisting of California, Oregon,
   and Washington) consumes 35% less energy than a home in the South
   Central region. Some of the regional differences can be explained by
   climate. The heavily populated coastal areas of the Pacific states
   experience generally mild winters and summers, reducing the need for
   both home heating and air conditioning. The warm, humid climates of the
   South Central and South Atlantic regions lead to higher electricity
   usage, while the cold winters experienced in the Northeast and North
   Central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and
   heating oil. The state with the lowest per capita energy use is New
   York, at 205 million Btu/yr,^[24] and the highest is Wyoming, at
   slightly over 1 billion Btu/yr.^[25]

   Other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken
   at the local and state levels. California has some of the strictest
   environmental laws and building codes in the country, leading its
   per-household energy consumption to be lower than all other states
   except Hawaii.

   The land-use decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the
   regional differences in energy use. Townhouses are more energy
   efficient than single-family homes because less heat, for example, is
   wasted per person. Similarly, areas with more homes in a compact
   neighborhood encourage walking, biking and transit, thereby reducing
   transportation energy use. A 2011 U.S. E.P.A. study found that
   multi-family homes in urban neighborhoods, with well-insulated
   buildings and fuel-efficient cars, can save more than 2/3 of the energy
   used by conventionally built single-family houses in suburban areas
   (with standard cars).^[26]

Oil[edit]

   Further information: Oil megaprojects (2011)

   For most of the twentieth century and the early part of the
   twenty-first century, the majority of energy consumed has been from oil
   - fossil fuel provided 81% of the world's energy in 2009, with oil the
   largest contribution.^[27] The United States became a world power in
   the early 20th century as they increased development of oil production
   and influenced world oil reserves for growth and development.^[28] As
   the 20th century developed, petroleum gained increasing importance by
   providing heating and power to the commercial and industrial sectors.
   Oil was also used in transportation; first for railroads and later for
   motor vehicles.^[29]

   As automobiles became more affordable, demand for oil quickly rose.
   Since the rise of the automobile industry, oil price, demand, and
   production have all increased. From 1900 to 1980, fuel was directly
   correlated with Gross National Product (GNP), oil shocks have often
   coincided with recessions, and the government has responded to oil
   shocks with a variety of methods.^[30] In the 1920s, oil prices were
   peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running
   out. Congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies, so a
   generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in 1926, which
   increased investment returns substantially. This change induced
   additional exploration activity, and subsequently the discovery of
   large new oil reservoirs.^[31]

   The next decade the situation was reversed, with prices low and
   dropping. This led to demands for more “orderly” competition and set
   minimum oil prices. Rather than repealing the previous policies enacted
   in the 1920s, Congress enacted a price-support system. Similar cycles
   have occurred in the 1950s and 1970s.^[31]

Price[edit]

   With the exception of one, every US recession since World War II
   experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil. This correlation
   strongly signifies the US dependency of oil for the economy, as well as
   oil’s importance in US development for most of the time since the war.
   Many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the post-war
   period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich
   countries.^[32] Domestic production and consumption were outpaced by US
   demand toward the end of the 1960s, and Middle Eastern nations gained a
   significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on
   their production.^[30] Price increases have been directly related to
   increased investment and subsequent production in oil. Following World
   War II, European reconstruction was the primary objective of the United
   States economy, and investment eventually rose after a long-term price
   increase at the end of the war. During the 1950s, there were strikes by
   oil workers, production restrictions imposed by the Texas Railroad
   Commission, as well as the Suez Crisis and Korean War—all creating
   steep price increases, with prices only falling after production was
   able to meet demand. Peak Oil in the United States resulted in a
   definite decline of US reserves and even more strikes by oil workers.
   Additional singular events such as the OPEC embargo, the rupture of the
   Trans-Arabian Pipeline, and Iranian Nationalization of the oil industry
   led to further price increases that were never before seen. Each case
   was followed by a marked recession in the US economy.^[32]

   Recently, oil prices have risen, briefly, to as high as
   $145/barrel,^[33] and U.S. gasoline prices jumped from $1.37 to
   $2.37/gallon in 2005,^[34] leading to a search for alternate sources,
   and by 2012, less than half of US oil consumption was imported.^[35]

Consumption and production[edit]

   In the twentieth century, oil production became of more value, as the
   US industrialized and developed commercial transportation, such as
   railroads and motor vehicles. Furthermore, oil consumption also
   increased due to electricity. After electricity, oil became more
   important in commercial, manufacturing and residential sectors such as
   heating and cooking. Therefore, during this period, the growth of oil
   consumption indicates that the United States was becoming dependent on
   oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry. However, U.S
   oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the U.S
   market, which led the U.S to look for a new supply
   internationally.^[29]

   U.S. consumption of oil increased 53% between 1915 and 1919, followed
   by another increase of 27% in 1920. The first shock of the
   transportation era occurred in 1920 and lasted for about a year. The
   shortage of oil devastated the entire West Coast with hour-long lines
   for gasoline, and in many places fuel was not available for at least a
   week. Finally, big production from Texas, California and Oklahoma took
   the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall 40% between 1920
   and 1926. The Great Depression in 1929 was a time with growing supply
   and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about 66% from
   1926 to 1931.^[29]

   Toward the end of World War II, the automotive era settled rapidly, and
   the U.S. demand of oil increased 12% between 1945 and 1947 while motor
   vehicle registrations increased by 22%. Around 1948, demand of oil
   exceeded supply of oil, leading the U.S. to start importing oil.
   Therefore, the U.S. quickly became a major importer of oil, instead of
   being the major exporter.^[29]

   In 1952, due to a strike by US oil refinery workers, the United States
   and the United Kingdom cut 30% of fuel delivery to civilian flights,
   while Canada postponed all private flights. Until the 1960s, the price
   of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the
   excess demand of oil in the U.S. However, in 1973, the price of oil
   increased due to the OPEC oil embargo against the U.S. They were
   against the U.S because the United States supported Israel in the Yom
   Kippur War. During that time, Arab members of OPEC reduced produce oil
   4.4mb/d for two months, 7.5% of global output. During this time, people
   reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and
   carpooling to work. In addition, people were limited to 10 gallons of
   oil a week, and led to a downturn in oil consumption.^[29]

   After the Crisis of 1973, price of oil increased again between 1979 and
   1980 due to the Iranian revolution. This crisis was related to
   political instability in a major oil-exporting region. During this
   period, oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency. Cars at that
   time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was
   also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil. This led to a decline
   in U.S. demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports.
   The last energy crises in the U.S occurred in 1990. This occurred
   because Iraq invaded Kuwait. Similar to the previous crisis, price of
   oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and
   had a smaller effect.^[29]

   In 2010 70.5% of petroleum consumption in the U.S. was for
   transportation. Approximately 2/3 of transportation consumption was
   gasoline.^[36] Today, U.S is still dependent on oil as oil is an
   important player socially, economically and politically. U.S. demand of
   oil is increasing exponentially causing the U.S. to continue to rely on
   foreign countries.^[29]

Policy[edit]

   Regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history.
   Policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as; price,
   production, consumption, supply and demand. The Oil market has a
   history of booms and troughs, which caused producers to demand
   government intervention. Many times this government involvement only
   made the situation worse, and many of the regulations were quickly
   ruled illegal and removed. Before World War II, many of the problems
   within the oil market were related to changing prices. During the
   1920s, oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil
   depletion. In response to these fears, during Coolidge’s term, Congress
   enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of
   investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new, large oil
   reservoirs. The next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new
   investment and overproduction. The declining prices led producers to
   demand some form of price support system. One example of how prices
   were propped up was a pro-rationing order made by the Texas Railroad
   Commission, which restricted oil production and increased price. This
   order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in 1931. The
   1930s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil
   industry and began with the creation of the National Industrial
   Recovery Act, in 1933. This act allowed for natural price competition,
   instead of agreements between the major producers. However, this act
   was ruled unconstitutional in 1934.

   While the time before World War II was filled with issues regarding
   price, the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due
   to the price support established during the 1920s and 1930s. The
   artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower
   priced foreign producers. In 1955, a clause was added to the Reciprocal
   Trade Act Amendments which gave the president the power to limit
   imports of a specific commodity, if that particular commodity was
   harmful to the security of the nation. This clause allowed Eisenhower
   to enact oil import quotas in 1959 which ultimately caused
   international oil prices to decline. These import quotas restricted
   international oil companies from the US market, and led them to form
   OPEC. During the 1970s, Richard Nixon put in place many phrases of
   price controls. After many new regulations that altered the original
   price control system, President Carter eventually began removing these
   controls in 1979.^[31] During the Carter administration, in response to
   an energy crisis and hostile Iranian and Soviet Union relations,
   President Jimmy Carter announced the Carter Doctrine which declared
   that any interference with U. S. interests in the Persian Gulf would be
   considered an attack on U.S. vital interests.^[37] This doctrine was
   later expanded by Ronald Reagan.^[38] Since the 1990s, the oil market
   has been free of most regulations.^[31]

Electrical Energy[edit]

   The United States of America (USA) is the world's second largest
   producer and consumer of electricity.^[39] It consumes about 20%^[40]
   of the world's supply of electricity. This section provides a summary
   of the consumption and generation of the USA Electric industry. Based
   upon data mined from US DOE Energy Information Administration/Electric
   Power Annual 2012 files.^[41] Data was obtained from the most recent
   DOE Energy Information Agency (EIA) files. Consumption is detailed from
   the residential, commercial, industrial, and other user communities.
   Generation is detailed for the major fuel sources of coal, natural gas,
   nuclear, petroleum, hydro and the other renewables of wind, wood, other
   biomass, geothermal and solar. Changes to the electrical energy fuel
   mix and other trends are identified. Progress in wind and solar
   contributions to the energy mix are addressed. Expected changes in the
   generation environment during the next 5 years are discussed.

   US Electric Energy Consumption by Consumer Communities

   Total electrical energy consumption^[42] in 2012 was 4,095 Billion kWh
   (B kWh). 126.8 Million residential customers^[43] used 1,374.5 B kWh -
   33.6% of USA’s 2012 load. 17.7 Million commercial customers used
   1,327.1 B kWh - 32.4%. 732K Industrial customers used 985.7 B kWh - 24%
   and 83 Transportation customers used 7.3 B kWh -0.2%. 400.4 B kWh or
   9.8% were system^[44] usage (138 B kWh) and system loses and
   unaccounted loads (262.4 B kWh). Average residential cost/kWh was
   $.1188 with a monthly usage of about 903 kWh for a cost of
   $107.29/month. In Hawaii the cost/kWh was $.3734 resulting in a monthly
   bill for 903 kWh of $337.22. In Louisiana the cost/kWh was $.0837
   resulting in a monthly bill of $75.59 for 903 kWh's. Per capita
   consumption from the electrical grid in 2012 was 13,047 kWh down 6%
   from the 2007 high.

   Total Consumption in the peak year of 2007 was 4,184.5 B kWh up from
   3,836 in 2000. Percentages for each consumer type is shown in the
   following graph.

   A profile of the electric energy consumption.^[45] for 2012 is shown in
   the following graph. Deviations from the monthly average of 341.25 G
   Kwhs for each month is shown. The April minimum of 298.7 G Kwhs to the
   July peak of 419.5 G Kwhs shows the range of consumption variations.

   The following table identifies those states which must import
   electrical energy from neighboring states to meet their consumption
   needs. Each states total electric generation for 2012 is compared with
   the states consumption and its share of the system loses and the
   difference between the generated electric energy and its total
   consumption usage (including its share of the system loses) is the
   amount of energy it imports. For Hawaii (HI) total consumption equals
   generated energy . For the other states multiplying their direct
   consumption by 1.103492016 (4126932717/3739884527) results in USA
   generation (including net imports) being equal to USA total
   consumption.

   supply those that need additional energy. Each states total electric
   generation for 2012 is compared with the states consumption and its
   share of the system loses and the difference between the generated
   electric energy and its total consumption (including its share of the
   system loses) is the amount of energy it exports. For Hawaii (HI) total
   consumption equals generated energy . For the other states multiplying
   their direct consumption by 1.103492016 (4126932717/3739884527) results
   in USA generation (including net imports) being equal to USA total
   consumption usage. State export is determined by subtracting the
   state's total consumption from its generation.

   2012 USA STATES RENEWABLE ELECTRICAL GENERATION

Trends[edit]

   In 2012 USA’s electrical energy usage was 5% more than in 2002. It was
   2.2% less than the peak in 2007. It was 1% less than in 2011. Per
   capita consumption has decreased about 6% since its peak in 2007 and
   every year since has shown a decrease in individual consumption.
   Conservation efforts are helping. At least, for the next decade, coal,
   natural gas, and nuclear will remain the top three fuels for electric
   energy generation in the USA. Coal will continuously decrease its
   contribution with natural gas increasing its contribution. Nuclear will
   have some downs (decommissionings) and ups (new online plants) but
   probably remain about constant. Hydro will maintain. Petroleum will
   continue to decrease in importance. Wind and solar will continue to
   grow in importance; their combined usage was 4.48% in Feb 2014 and
   should reach 5% by the latter half of 2014, because of very rapid
   adoption of solar since 2012, along with continued increases in wind
   output.^[51]

Projections[edit]

   Per capita energy use in the United States

   From the beginning of the United States until 1973, total energy
   (including electrical) use increased by about 3%/year, while population
   increased an average of 2.2%/year. Per capita energy use from 1730 to
   1870 was about 100 million Btu/person. In the 20th century this
   increased to 300 million (332 million Btu/person/year, 97 thousand
   kWh/person/year in 1981).^[52] Due to efficiency improvements this
   could drop considerably.

   For the next five years, using data mined from Electric Power Annual
   2012 ^[53] the expected yearly changes to the US power generation
   portfolio are shown in the following chart. Planned Additions-Deletions
   to Generating Infrastructure.jpg Using 2012 as a baseline, electric
   generating capability in 2017 by coal would be down 24.4 Gigawatts:
   Petroleum would be down 3.1 Gigawatts. Natural gas would be up 26.3
   Gigawatts; solar would be up 10 Gigawatts; wind, +5.9 Gigawatts; Hydro,
   +0.6 Gigawatts; Wood, +0.6 Gigawatts; Other Bio, 0.4 Gigawatts; Geo,
   +0.2 Gigawatts and nuclear, 0.2 Gigawatts. Thus, in 2017, the total US
   electric generating infrastructure would be 1079.8 Gigawatts (+2%) up
   from 1063 Gigawatts in 2012. Fossil fuels would decrease by only 1.2
   Gigawatts because of the major increase in natural gas. Renewables
   would increase by 17.7 Gigawatts (+11.4%) and nuclear would increase by
   0.2 Gigawatts.

   Using each fuel source capacity factor from 2012 and its yearly
   generating capacity would result in the expected electric energy output
   as shown in the following chart. Expected Electrical Energy Generation
   2013-2017.jpg In 2017 coal would produce 34.11% of US electric energy.
   Natural gas would produce 32.16%. Nuclear, 18.86%; Hydro, 6.81%; Wind
   3.79%; Wood, 1%; Bio, 0.52%; Solar, 0.44% ( a 300% increase from 2012)
   and Geo 0.42%. Other sources, including net imports would contribute
   1.37%. Yearly contributions (%) by each fuel source are shown in the
   following bar chart. Expected Energy Output (G Kwh) 2013-2017.jpg

   The amount of electrical energy (Gigawatt hours) produced is a function
   of the generating capacity (Gigawatts) and the capacity factor,
   associated with the fuel source. This is about 25-30% for wind power
   and about 15-20% for solar power. This means that for every 100 MW of
   wind power installed, on average it will generate from about 25 to 30
   MW, depending on the location. For every 100 MW of solar power
   installed, it will generate an average of from about 15 to 20 MW,
   depending on the location, as well as other factors. A Nuclear plant
   would have a capacity factor of about 90%.

   A concentrating solar array (CSP) with thermal storage can have a
   capacity factor of over 75%, and provide power 24 hours a day. The
   Bureau of Land Management has allocated over 97 million acres of land
   in the southwest for solar projects - enough for 4 million MW of CSP
   solar power, with 24-hour storage - more than enough to supply all of
   the energy used in the United States.^[54]^[55]

   listed in the column entitled Major uses in the above tables. In 1999,
   a study by Mark. P. Mills^[56] of the Green Earth Society reported that
   computers consumed 13% of the entire US supply. Numerous researchers
   questioned Mills' methodology and it was later demonstrated that he was
   off by an order of magnitude; for example, Lawrence Berkeley Labs
   concluded that the figure was nearer three percent of US electricity
   use. Although the Mills study was inaccurate,^[57]^[58]^[59] it helped
   drive the debate to the national level, and in 2006 the US Senate
   started a study of the energy consumption of Server farms.

Fossil-fuel equivalency[edit]

   The total energy consumption reported above from the Annual Energy
   Review has been adjusted by a fossil-fuel equivalency factor in order
   to estimate how much oil would be required to supply all of the energy
   used. While there is 3,412 Btu per kWh, a factor of 10,460 Btu/kWh was
   used for nuclear and 9,760 Btu/kWh for renewable energy, for 2010, to
   reflect how much oil would be required. This inflates the reported
   total energy consumption, and roughly triples the apparent share from
   non-fossil fuel sources. As oil is less important, this adjustment may
   be removed, as is largely the case in other countries.^[60]^[61]

International cooperation[edit]

   President Barack Obama and China's President Hu Jintao announced on
   2009-11-17 a far-reaching package of measures to strengthen cooperation
   between the United States and China on clean energy. The presidents
   began by establishing a U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center to
   facilitate joint research and development of renewable energy
   technologies by scientists from both countries. The center will be
   supported by $150 million in public and private funds over the next
   five years, split evenly between the partners. Initial research
   priorities will be developing better energy efficiency by way of things
   like electric vehicles.^[citation needed]

   The two countries will also leverage private sector resources to
   develop clean energy projects in China through the U.S.-China Energy
   Cooperation Program (ECP). More than 22 companies are founding members
   of the program. The ECP will include collaborative projects involving
   renewable energy, smart grids, electric vehicles, green buildings,
   combined heat and power and energy efficiency.^[62]
