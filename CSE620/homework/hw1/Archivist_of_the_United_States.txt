   David Ferriero, Tenth Archivist of the United States

   The Archivist of the United States is the chief official overseeing the
   operation of the National Archives and Records Administration. The
   first Archivist, R.D.W. Connor, began serving in 1934, when the
   National Archives was established as an independent federal agency by
   Congress. The Archivists served as subordinate officials of the General
   Services Administration from 1949 until the National Archives and
   Records Administration became an independent agency again on April 1,
   1985. This position is held by David Ferriero, who was named to the
   office in 2009.

   The Archivist is appointed by the President and is responsible for
   safeguarding and making available for study all the permanently
   valuable records of the federal government, including the original
   Declaration of Independence, Constitution and Bill of Rights, which are
   displayed in the Archives' main building in Washington, D.C.

   Under Public Law No. 98-497, the Archivist also must maintain custody
   of state ratifications of amendments to the Constitution and it is the
   Archivist's duty to issue a certificate proclaiming a particular
   amendment duly ratified and part of the Constitution if the
   legislatures of at least three-quarters of the states approve the
   proposed amendment. The Amendment and its certificate of ratification
   are then published in the Federal Register and the amendment is
   included in the United States Statutes at Large.

   In accordance with Title 1, Chapter 2 §106a of the United States Code,
   the Archivist of the United States also receives the original version
   of all statutes of the United States, once enacted. Joint Resolutions
   and Acts of Congress signed into law by the president are delivered by
   the office of the President to the National Archives. The same happens
   if a bill becomes law because the president fails to approve or veto it
   within the constitutionally mandated period of time (ten days,
   excluding Sundays, and only counted when Congress is in session). If
   the President vetoes a bill but the presidential veto is overridden,
   the new law is transmitted to the National Archives not by the office
   of the President, but by Congress: in this case, the presiding officer
   of the last House to consider the bill certifies that the presidential
   objection was overridden, and sends the new law to the Archivist of the
   United States. In all cases, the office of the Archivist (the National
   Archives) maintains custody of the original document and (by means of
   the Office of the Federal Register, a division of the National
   Archives) provides for its publication as a slip law and for the
   inclusion of the new statute in the United States Statutes at Large.
   The actual printing and circulation of the slip law and of the volumes
   of the United States Statutes at Large is the responsibility of the
   Government Printing Office, headed by the Public Printer of the United
   States.

   By means of the Office of the Federal Register, the National Archives
   also publishes documents of the Executive Branch, such as presidential
   proclamations and executive orders, retaining custody of the original
   signed documents.

   In all United States presidential elections, the Archivist of the
   United States also has duties concerning the custody of Electoral
   College documents, such as certificates of ascertainment declaring the
   names of the presidential electors chosen in each state, and of the
   certificates of vote produced by the electors of each state.^[1] In
   practice, these administrative responsibilities are delegated to the
   Director of the Federal Register.^[2]
