   Apart from professional business attire, fashion in the United States
   is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse
   cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of
   recent immigrants, cowboy hats and boots and leather motorcycle jackets
   are emblematic of specifically American styles.

History[edit]

   Fashion norms have changed greatly from decade to decade. The United
   States has generally followed and in some cases led trends in the
   history of Western fashion. It has some unique regional clothing
   styles, such as western wear.

   Blue jeans were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant
   Levi Strauss, a German immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many
   American teenagers a century later. They are now widely worn on every
   continent by people of all ages and social classes. Along with
   mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably U.S.
   culture's primary contribution to global fashion.^[1]

Fashion industry[edit]

   The country is also home to the headquarters of many leading designer
   labels such as Ralph Lauren, Victoria secret and Calvin Klein. Labels
   such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Eckō cater to various niche markets.
   Another type of clothing worn throughout the United States by many
   types of people is the T-shirt. It can be plain and white, or colored
   with company logos or funny messages. T-shirts are arguably the most
   worn type of shirt in the United States. A new trend in the United
   States toward sustainable clothing has led to the emergence of organic
   cotton T-shirts from labels such as BeGood Clothing^[2] and American
   Apparel.

Regional and cultural variation[edit]

   Sagging in Detroit, Michigan.

   Dress norms in the United States are generally consistent with those of
   other post-industrial western nations and has become largely informal
   since the mid 20th century. Clothing in the United States also depends
   on a variety of factors including location, venue, and demographic
   factors such as ethnicity. Blue jeans are a consistent fashion trend
   among all classes. a type of ethnic clothing used for cultural events
   found south of the United States (U.S.)

   The western states are commonly noted for being more informal in their
   manner of dress than those closer to the eastern seaboard. Furthermore,
   individuals belonging to certain ethnic groups such as some Native
   American tribal members and individuals of Scottish descent may wear
   clothing to represent their ethnic identity at certain events.
   Conspicuous consumption and a desire for quality have also lead to a
   strong preference for designer label clothing among many in the middle
   and upper classes.

   The toleration for body expression that deviates from the mainstream
   such as complete body tattoos or nudism is strongly linked to the
   sub-culture and location in which an individual may find him or
   herself. Generally speaking the United States tends to be less tolerant
   towards nudity than Western Europe, even in more tolerant areas such as
   California. As stated above the tolerance shown for personal expression
   such as cross-dressing, piercing, etc... varies greatly with location
   and sub-culture and may be completely appropriate in one venue while
   being taboo in another.^[3]
