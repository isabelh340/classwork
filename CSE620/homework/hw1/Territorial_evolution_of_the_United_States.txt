Territorial evolution of the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   See also: United States territorial acquisitions

   This is a list of the evolution of the borders of the United States.
   This lists each change to the internal and external borders of the
   country, as well as status and name changes. It also shows the
   surrounding areas that eventually became part of the United States.
   Each stage has a map, to show what the specific makeup of the country
   was at any given time.

   After achieving independence with the Treaty of Paris, the United
   States expanded westward, enlarging its borders seven times, with two
   major border adjustments, one each with colonies of the United Kingdom
   and Spain, and several small disputes. The original thirteen states
   grew into fifty states, most of which began as incorporated
   territories. The general pattern seen in this is of territorial
   expansion, carving of organized territories from the newly acquired
   land, modification of the borders of these territories, and eventual
   statehood. Only two states, Nevada and Missouri, grew appreciably after
   statehood, and five, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and
   Virginia, lost land, in each case to form new states.

Notes[edit]

     * This article does not include unincorporated territories and
       countries under free association. The fundamental difference
       between unincorporated and incorporated territories is that
       incorporated territories are considered to forever be under the
       jurisdiction of the United States Constitution, whereas it is
       possible for unincorporated territories to become independent.^[1]
       These are:
          + Nations under Compacts of Free Association: Marshall Islands,
            Federated States of Micronesia, Palau.
          + Unincorporated, organized territories: Guam, United States
            Virgin Islands.
          + Commonwealths, another form of unincorporated and organized
            territory: Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico (This is
            different from the term commonwealth used by some states.)
          + American Samoa is unincorporated and unorganized, but has a
            constitution and self-government, making it functionally very
            similar to an organized territory.
          + The United States Minor Outlying Islands, which are
            uninhabited, unorganized, and except for Palmyra Atoll,
            unincorporated.
          + The former unincorporated territories of the Line Islands,
            Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and
            the Phoenix Islands.
          + The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, a United Nations
            trusteeship granted to the United States following World War
            II. It has since dissolved, becoming the Marshall Islands,
            Federated States of Micronesia, the Northern Mariana Islands,
            and Palau.
          + Various unincorporated territories whose claims under the
            Guano Island Act have been abrogated by the United States
            Government.
     * "Unorganized territory" is not a name; it simply means Congress has
       not passed an organic act for the territory. In most situations,
       the purpose of unorganized territory was to act as land for Native
       American settlement. Later, the last unorganized territory in the
       country was indeed referred to as "Indian Territory", though this
       is not an official name. The last territories acquired by the
       United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Mexican Cession, began
       unorganized, but not as land set aside for Native Americans, but
       simply because they had not been organized yet. Palmyra Atoll is
       the only remaining unorganized incorporated U.S. territory.
     * Dotted lines on the borders mean that region is part of a country
       not fully shown on the map, which is confined to the present-day
       borders of the United States. An exception is Oregon Country, which
       was shared land which extended beyond the area of the map.
     * Some territorial disputes and borders from early in the United
       States' history are unclear. For example, the border between West
       Florida and East Florida seems unclear. For the purposes of
       simplicity, this article uses the original border, the Apalachicola
       River, even though later maps tended to move it west to the Perdido
       River. This is partly because the Organic Act for Florida specified
       that it included parts of both West and East Florida; if the border
       were the Perdido River, then Florida Territory would not have
       included any of West Florida, it having already been divided among
       Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.^[2]
     * Several very small changes are included in the list but not
       included in the maps.

    1. The switch of two extra counties from Virginia to West Virginia at
       the end of the American Civil War.
    2. The Alaska Boundary Dispute, since it arose from a total lack of
       surveying, rather than a dispute over the surveyed lines; it would
       also appear quite small on the map.
    3. When the Dakota Territory was created, it also included land south
       of 43° N and north of the Keya Paha and Niobrara rivers. This was
       transferred to the state of Nebraska on March 28, 1882.^[3]
    4. The two small adjustments to the Indiana Territory.
    5. Various disputes along the Rio Grande with Mexico.

     * Ratification of the Constitution, Confederacy formation and
       reconstruction are simplified to make the map simpler.
     * Other small territorial changes, such as minor adjustments to state
       borders or transfers of small amounts of territories between states
       (such as Boston Corner, New York) are also not shown on this list.

18th century[edit]

   United States 1789-03-1789-08.png

   March 4, 1789

   The United States Constitution came into effect, forming the new
   nation. Note that the states ratified at different times, but to
   simplify the map, the final result is shown here.

   The United States achieved independence from the Kingdom of Great
   Britain with the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, which
   established that the thirteen colonies were sovereign and independent
   states. The borders were established by Article 2 of the treaty, but
   with a couple of issues. First, it stated that the border would run
   west from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River - at the time,
   it was not known that the headwaters of the Mississippi lay south of
   such a line, so the border has since been taken to run south from the
   lake to the river.^[4]

   Some peculiarities to point out to those familiar only with the current
   borders: Many states had sea-to-sea grants from the British crown that
   they would not give up easily, so prior to this date, they ceded this
   land to the federal government in exchange for their Revolutionary War
   debts. However, Georgia did not do so until much later, and Connecticut
   ceded most land but kept its Western Reserve. Virginia ceded its claim
   to the territory north and west of the Ohio River, and this land became
   unorganized territory. North Carolina also ceded its claim to its
   western counties, but this was not officially accepted by Congress
   until 1790. New York ceded its claim on the Erie Triangle to the
   federal government. At this point in history, all of the states except
   for Georgia and Virginia were at their present-day borders, except for
   some of the minor issues mentioned above.

   West Florida claimed a border further north than what the United States
   said it had. Its border had been 31° north when Spain ceded it to the
   United Kingdom. The British later moved its border north to 32°38′
   latitude, but when Spanish Florida was ceded back to Spain in the
   Treaty of Paris, the British cited the original border at the 31st
   parallel north, but Spain continued to claim the higher border.^[5]
   Also, the borders at the northern area of the Maine District of
   Massachusetts and the area northwest of Lake Superior remained
   disputed.

   The Wedge, disputed since the 17th century, remained a point of
   contention between Delaware and Pennsylvania.

   The Vermont Republic was a complex matter, with areas being claimed by
   New York and New Hampshire, but it existed as a de facto unrecognized
   independent state.
   United States 1789-08-1790-04.png

   August 7, 1789

   The United States Congress affirmed the organization of the Territory
   North West of the Ohio River, or Northwest Territory, under the terms
   of the Northwest Ordinance.^[6] Northwest Territory consisted of
   present-day Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, northeastern Minnesota, most
   of Ohio, and Wisconsin. The Northwest Territory had previously been
   organized under the Articles of Confederation on July 13, 1787, and was
   slightly modified under the new Constitution.

   Due to the Yazoo Land Fraud, an act was signed by President John Adams,
   authorizing him to appoint commissioners to negotiate with Georgia
   about ceding its western land. The act created Mississippi Territory in
   the region ceded by West Florida, corresponding to roughly the southern
   third of present-day Mississippi and Alabama except their panhandles,
   which were part of West Florida.^[12]
   United States 1800-07-04-1800-07-10.png

   July 4, 1800

   Indiana Territory was formed from the western portion of Northwest
   Territory.^[13] It corresponded to present-day Illinois, Indiana,
   northeastern Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as the western half of
   the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and all but the eastern tip of the
   Upper Peninsula. Northwest Territory was left with only most of Ohio
   and the rest of Michigan.

   to Indiana Territory.^[13]
   United States 1803-04-1804-03.png

   April 30, 1803

   The Louisiana Purchase was made, expanding the United States west of
   the Mississippi River. The U.S. later had a dispute with Spain
   regarding whether France had included Spanish West Florida, located
   east of the Mississippi River, in the sale.^[17] West of the
   Mississippi, it was defined as the Mississippi Basin, whose extent was
   not known at the time and extended slightly north of the modern
   Canada-US border.^[18] It consisted of the whole of present-day
   Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma, and portions
   of Colorado, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota,
   South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. It also included the southernmost
   portions of the present-day Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba,
   and Saskatchewan.
   United States 1804-03-1804-10.png

   March 27, 1804

   The unorganized land ceded by Georgia was added to Mississippi
   Territory, consisting of the whole of present-day Mississippi and
   Alabama, minus their panhandles which were still part of West
   Florida.^[19]
   United States 1804-10-1805-01.png

   October 1, 1804

   The Louisiana Purchase was split into the District of Louisiana, which
   was temporarily under the authority of Indiana Territory, and the
   organized Territory of Orleans, which corresponded to part of
   present-day Louisiana with a small portion of Texas.^[20] The western
   border of Orleans Territory caused further conflict with New Spain,
   specifically over the region between the Sabine River on the west and
   the Arroyo Hondo (River) on the east, which became known as the Sabine
   Free State. This land was later confirmed as U.S. territory by the
   Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819.
   United States 1805-01-1805-07.png

   January 11, 1805

   Illinois Territory was split from Indiana Territory. Illinois Territory
   included present-day Illinois, northeastern Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
   Indiana Territory included the present-day borders of Indiana, with its
   western and eastern borders continuing northward; thus, it also
   included the central portion of the upper peninsula of Michigan, as
   well as Door Peninsula of present-day Wisconsin.^[13]

1810s[edit]

   October 27, 1810

   By proclamation of President James Madison, the United States annexed
   the Baton Rouge and Mobile Districts of Spanish West Florida, declaring
   them to have been part of the Louisiana Purchase. One month earlier,
   these had declared independence from Spain as the Republic of West
   Florida. The U.S. Army seized control by threat of force in December
   after 90 days of independence as a country.^[23]
   United States 1812-04-1812-05.png

   April 30, 1812

   Most of the Territory of Orleans was admitted as the 18th state,
   Louisiana. The rest of the territory (the northwestern tip) was ceded
   to Louisiana Territory.^[24]
   United States 1812-05-1812-06.png

   May 12, 1812

   The federal government annexed a part of West Florida, the Mobile

   June 4, 1812

   Louisiana Territory, having the same name as a state, was renamed to
   Missouri Territory.^[26]

   April 17, 1813

   Republican Army of the North captured San Antonio, Texas, assassinated
   the governor Manuel María de Salcedo, proclaimed Texas an independent
   nation, and issued Texas's first constitution on this date. Spanish
   forces recaptured the province later that year and executed any Tejanos
   accused of having Republican tendencies. By 1820 fewer than 2000
   Hispanic citizens remained in Spanish Texas.
   United States 1816-1817-03.png

   December 11, 1816

   The southern portion of Indiana Territory was admitted as the 19th
   state, Indiana. The remainder became unorganized.^[13]
   United States 1817-03-1817-12.png

   March 3, 1817

   Alabama Territory was split from Mississippi Territory; both correspond
   to their present-day counterparts.^[27]
   United States 1817-12-1818-10.png

   December 10, 1817

   Mississippi Territory was admitted as the 20th state, Mississippi.
   United States 1818-10-1818-12.png

   October 20, 1818

   The Treaty of 1818 established the 49th parallel north west of the Lake
   of the Woods as the border with British-held lands, and Oregon Country
   was established as a shared land between the United States and United
   Kingdom.^[28] Oregon Country consisted of most of present-day Idaho and
   Oregon, all of Washington, and a portion of Montana, as well as the
   southern part of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The treaty
   transferred the Red River Basin to the United States, consisting of
   northwestern Minnesota, northeastern North Dakota, and the northeastern
   tip of South Dakota.
   United States 1818-12-1819-03.png

   December 3, 1818

   The southern portion of Illinois Territory was admitted as the 21st
   state, Illinois. The remainder was reassigned to Michigan Territory.
   The unorganized lands which had been a part of Indiana Territory prior
   to the admission of Indiana as a state were also assigned to Michigan
   Territory.^[13]
   United States 1819-03-1819-12.png

   March 2, 1819

   The southern part of Missouri Territory was organized as Arkansaw
   Territory, consisting of present-day Arkansas as well as part of
   Oklahoma.^[29] It was not officially spelled Arkansas until later.
   United States 1819-12-1820.png

   December 14, 1819

   Alabama Territory was admitted as the 22nd state, Alabama.

1820s[edit]

   23rd state, Maine, as part of the Missouri Compromise. The northern
   border of Maine was not settled until 1842.
   United States 1821-07-1821-08.png

   July 10, 1821

   The Adams-Onís Treaty or Transcontinental Treaty came into effect,
   establishing a defined border between the United States and New Spain.
   The treaty ceded Spain's claims to Oregon Country to the United States
   and American claims to Texas to Spain; moved portions of present-day
   Colorado, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, and all of New Mexico and Texas, to
   New Spain; and all of Spanish Florida to the United States.^[30] The
   new borders intruded on Arkansaw Territory's Miller County, created on
   April 1, 1820, which dipped below the Red River and into land now ceded
   to Spain. However, the remoteness of the region caused no serious
   conflict with Spain.^[31]
   United States 1821-08-1822.png

   August 10, 1821

   The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted as the 24th
   state, Missouri. The remainder became unorganized. Missouri did not
   include its northwestern triangle at this point, that being added later
   in the Platte Purchase.^[32]

   September 16, 1821

   Ukase of 1821 attempts to forbid non-Russian ships from approaching the
   Northwest Coast. Only attempt at enforcement is seizure of the U.S.
   brig Pearl in 1822.^[33] U.S. reacts with the Monroe Doctrine in
   1823.^[34]^[35]

   September 27, 1821

   The Viceroyalty of New Spain achieved independence as Mexico. Spanish
   Texas became Mexican Texas.
   United States 1822-1824.png

   March 30, 1822

   East Florida and the portion of West Florida not already part of other
   states were combined and organized as Florida Territory, which
   corresponded to present-day Florida.^[2] Around this time, the official
   spelling of Arkansaw Territory became Arkansas Territory.^[29]
   United States 1824-1828.png

   November 15, 1824

   Arkansas Territory was shrunk, the western portion becoming
   unorganized.^[36]

   January 12, 1825

   Russo-American Treaty of 1824 gave Russian claims south of parallel
   54°40′ north to the United States. This and the Anglo-Russian
   Convention of 1825 leave Britain and the U.S. as the only claimants to
   Oregon Country. Russia retained Fort Ross, California until 1841.
   United States 1828-1834.png

   May 6, 1828

   Arkansas Territory was shrunk further, attaining the present-day
   borders of Arkansas, with the remainder again becoming unorganized,
   excepting the land it still claimed as Miller County.^[36]

1830s[edit]

   United States 1834-1836-03.png

   June 30, 1834

   A large portion of unorganized land was added to Michigan Territory,
   corresponding to present-day Iowa, western Minnesota, and eastern North
   Dakota and South Dakota.^[13]
   United States 1836-03-1836-06.png

   March 2, 1836

   The Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico, claiming a Rio
   Grande boundary encompassing present-day West Texas, the majority of
   New Mexico, and portions of Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming. Actual
   control extended over approximately the eastern half of present-day
   Texas. Miller County in Arkansas Territory now intruded on the borders
   of Texas, and the people there began to take a Texian identity, leading
   to both governments having representatives from the county.^[31]
   United States 1836-06-1836-07.png

   June 15, 1836

   Arkansas Territory was admitted as the 25th state, Arkansas. It
   continued to claim Miller County, with increasing irrelevance.^[31]
   United States 1836-07-1837-01.png

   July 4, 1836

   Wisconsin Territory was split off from Michigan Territory, consisting
   of present-day Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and eastern North and South
   Dakota. As an inducement to give up its claim over the Toledo Strip to
   Ohio, the whole of the present-day upper peninsula was assigned to
   Michigan Territory, giving it the present-day borders of Michigan.^[13]
   United States 1837-01-1837-03.png

   January 26, 1837

   Michigan Territory was admitted as the 26th state, Michigan.^[13]

   The Platte Purchase added a small area of land to Missouri, giving it
   its present-day boundaries.^[37]
   United States 1838-1842.png

   July 4, 1838

   Iowa Territory was split off from Wisconsin Territory, consisting of
   present-day Iowa, western Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota and South
   Dakota, leaving Wisconsin Territory with northeastern Minnesota and
   Wisconsin.^[13]

1840s[edit]

   United States 1842-1845-03.png

   November 10, 1842

   The Webster–Ashburton Treaty settled the border between the United
   States and lands held by the United Kingdom east of the Rocky
   Mountains, ending the disputes over the northern border of the state of
   Maine and northeastern border of Wisconsin Territory, which today
   resides in present day Minnesota.^[38]
   United States 1845-03-1845-12.png

   Florida Territory was admitted as the 27th state, Florida.
   United States 1845-12-1846-06.png

   December 29, 1845

   The Republic of Texas was admitted as the 28th state, Texas. The United
   States Congress passed the joint resolution of annexation on March 1,
   1845,^[39] but Texas did not agree to join the union for some time
   after. Although the annexation resolution avoided specifying Texas's
   boundaries, the U.S. inherited Texas's unenforced claims to South
   Texas, West Texas, over half of New Mexico, a third of Colorado, and
   small parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Wyoming. With Texas joining the
   union, Arkansas finally gave up its claim on Miller County.

   The Oregon Treaty established the 49th parallel west of the Lake of the
   Woods as the continental border (so it did not include Vancouver

   Territory, and a small portion became unorganized land.^[45] New Mexico
   Territory consisted of most of present-day Arizona and New Mexico, as
   well as a southern portion of Colorado and the southern tip of Nevada.
   Utah Territory consisted of present-day Utah, most of Nevada, and
   portions of Colorado and Wyoming. A peculiarity appeared at this time,
   when a small strip of land north of Texas was not officially designated
   as part of any state or territory (Texas gave up this land due to a
   United States federal law based on the Missouri Compromise, which
   prohibited slavery above the 36°30' parallel of North latitude). This
   came to be called the Neutral Strip or "No Man's Land", which
   corresponds to the present-day panhandle of Oklahoma.^[46]

   The main army of the Confederate States of America surrendered, and the
   Confederacy dissolved soon afterward. Much of the Confederate States'
   territory had already been retaken by force of arms prior to this point
   and the process of Reconstruction and readmission to the union would
   take several years following the Confederacy's collapse; to simplify
   the map, the former Confederate states are shown as already readmitted.
