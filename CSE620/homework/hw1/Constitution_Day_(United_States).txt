   Related to I am an American Day

   Constitution Day (or Citizenship Day) is an American federal observance
   that recognizes the adoption of the United States Constitution and
   those who have become U.S. citizens. It is normally observed on
   September 17, the day the U.S. Constitutional Convention signed the
   Constitution in 1787 in Philadelphia.^[2]

   When Constitution Day falls on a weekend or on another holiday, schools
   and other institutions observe the holiday on an adjacent weekday.^[3]
   This was the case in 2005 and 2011, when Constitution Day was generally
   observed on Friday, September 16,^[4] and 2006 when the holiday was
   observed on Monday, September 18.

   The law establishing the present holiday was created in 2004 with the
   passage of an amendment by Senator Robert Byrd to the Omnibus spending
   bill of 2004.^[4] Before this law was enacted, the holiday was known as
   "Citizenship Day". In addition to renaming the holiday "Constitution
   Day and Citizenship Day," the act mandates that all publicly funded
   educational institutions, and all federal agencies, provide educational
   programming on the history of the American Constitution on that
   day.^[5] In May 2005, the United States Department of Education
   announced the enactment of this law and that it would apply to any
   school receiving federal funds of any kind.^[3] This holiday is not
   observed by granting time off work for federal employees.

   Universities and colleges nationwide have created "U.S. Constitution
   and Citizenship Weeks" in order to meet the requirements of the law.
   For example, the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) has created a
   celebration week that includes "Constitution Trivia Contests",
   distribution of free copies of the U.S. Constitution, a campus &
   community fair (in which volunteer and community groups can share
   information with students), a web page with facts and links related to
   the Constitution and history of the United States. MSOE has also
   distributed thousands of free "Presidential quote" t-shirts to all
   students on campus.^[6]

History[edit]

Origins[edit]

   Iowa schools first recognized Constitution Day in 1911.^[7] In 1917,
   the Sons of the American Revolution formed a committee to promote
   Constitution Day. The committee would include members such as Calvin
   Coolidge, John D. Rockefeller, and General John Pershing.^[7]

I am an American Day[edit]

   This day was inspired by Arthur Pine, the head of a publicity-public
   relations firm in New York City bearing his name. At the New York
   World’s Fair, the writers of a new song called “I am an American”
   brought their manuscript to the attention of Arthur Pine who handled
   publicity for the band leader, Gary Gordon, and a music publisher.
   Arthur Pine had the song introduced on NBC, Mutual, and ABC by the
   orchestra leader, arranged for an “I am an American Day” at the World’s
   Fair and had a local New York newspaper tie-in with “I am an American
   Day” in the city. The promotion proved so successful that a newspaper
   chain promoted “I am an American Day” on a nation-wide basis and had
   President Roosevelt name it as an official day.^[8]

   In 1939, William Randolph Hearst advocated, through his chain of daily
   newspapers, the creation of a holiday to celebrate
   citizenship.^[citation needed] In 1940, Congress designated the third
   Sunday in May as "I am an American Day." In 1944 "I am an American Day"
   was promoted through the United States Immigration and Naturalization
   Service.^[9] A 16-minute film, I Am an American, was featured in
   American theaters as a short feature.^[10] In 1947 Hearst Newsreels
   featured the event on News of the Day.^[11] By 1949, governors of all
   48 states had issued Constitution Day proclamations.^[7] On February
   29, 1952, Congress moved the "I am an American Day" observation to
   September 17 and renamed it "Citizenship Day".^[12]^[13]

Louisville, Ohio – the Constitution Town[edit]

   Louisville, Ohio, calls itself Constitution Town and credits one of its
   own for getting the holiday national recognition. In 1952, resident
   Olga T. Weber petitioned municipal officials to establish Constitution
   Day, in honor of the creation of the US Constitution in 1787. Mayor
   Gerald A. Romary proclaimed September 17, 1952, as Constitution Day in
   the city. The following April, Weber requested that the Ohio General
   Assembly proclaim September 17 as state-wide Constitution Day. Her
   request was signed into law by Governor Frank J. Lausche. In August
   1953, she took her case to the United States Senate, which passed a
   resolution designating September 17–23 as Constitution Week. The Senate
   and House approved her request and it was signed into law by President
   Dwight D. Eisenhower. On April 15, 1957, the City Council of Louisville
   declared the city Constitution Town. The Ohio State Archaeological and
   Historical Society later donated four historical markers, located at
   the four main entrances to the city, explaining Louisville's role as
   originator of Constitution Day.^[14]
