Homeownership in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   A single family home valued at roughly $550,000 in Salinas, California.

   The homeownership rate in the United States^[1]^[2] in 2009 remained
   similar to that in some other post-industrial nations^[3] with 67.4% of
   all occupied housing units being occupied by the unit's owner. Home
   ownership rates vary depending on demographic characteristics of
   households such as ethnicity, race, type of household as well as
   location and type of settlement.

   Since 1960, the homeownership rate in the United States has remained
   relatively stable having increased 5.6% since 1960 when 62.1% of
   American households owned their own home. However, homeowner equity has
   fallen steadily since World War II and is now less than 50% of the
   value of homes on average.^[4] Homeownership was most common in rural
   areas and suburbs with three quarters of suburban households being
   homeowners. Among the country's regions the Midwestern states had the
   highest homeownership rate with the Western states having the
   lowest.^[2] Recent research has examined the decline in homeownership
   rates among households with "heads" aged 25 to 44 years, which fell
   substantially between 1980 and 2000 and recovered only partially during
   the 2001-05 housing boom. This research indicates that a trend toward
   marrying later and the increase in household earnings risk that
   occurred after 1980 account for a large share of the decline in young
   homeownership.^[5]

   Homeowners in the United States also tend to have higher incomes and
   households residing in their own home were more likely to be families
   (as opposed to individuals) than were their tenant counterparts.^[6]
   Among racial demographics, European Americans had the country's highest
   homeownership rate, while those identifying as being African American
   had the lowest homeownership rate. One study shows that homeownership
   rates appear correlated with higher school attainment.^[7]

   The name "homeownership rate" can be misleading. As defined by the US
   Census Bureau, it is the percentage of homes that are occupied by the
   owner. It is not the percentage of adults that own their own home. This
   latter percentage will be significantly lower than the homeownership
   rate because many households that are owner-occupied contain adult
   relatives (often young adults, descendents of the owner) who do not own
   their own home, and because single building multi-bedroom rental units
   can contain more than one adult, all of whom do not own a home.

Method[edit]

   In the US, the homeownership rate is created through the Housing
   Vacancy Survey by the US Census Bureau. It is created by dividing the
   owner occupied units by the total number of occupied units. This is an
   important point to understand changes in the homeownership rate over
   time. The bust of the housing bubble resulted in many houses becoming
   foreclosed. However, the decrease in the homeownership rate from 3Q2007
   to 4Q2007 was mostly a result of an increase in the renter's population
   and less due to a decrease in the homeowner population^[citation
   needed].

Government policy[edit]

   Homeownership has been promoted as government policy using several
   means involving mortgage debt and the government sponsored entities
   Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, which fund or
   guarantee $6.5 trillion of assets with the purpose of directly or
   indirectly promoting homeownership. Homeownership has been further
   promoted through tax policy which allows a tax deduction for mortgage
   interest payments on a primary residence. The Community Reinvestment
   Act also encourages homeownership for low-income earners. The promotion
   of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage
   borrowing and lending has given rise to debates regarding government
   policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.

Race[edit]

          Homeownership rate according to race.^[8]

   The homeownership rate, as well as its variations over time, has varied
   significantly by race.^[8] While homeowners constitute the majority of
   white, Asian and Native American households, the homeownership rate for
   African Americans and those identifying as Hispanic or Latino has
   typically fallen short of the fifty percent threshold. Whites have had
   the highest homeownership rate, followed by Asians and Native
   Americans.^[8]

   Hispanics had the lowest homeownership rate in the country in all
   years, except for 2002, up until 2005. For the last half of the decade
   of the 2000s the homeownership rate for Hispanics exceeded that of
   African Americans. Temporal fluctuations were slight for all races,
   with rates commonly not changing more than two percentage points per
   year.^[8]
   Homeownership rate according to race.[8]

   The strongest increase in the percentage of homeowners in the first
   half of the decade of the 2000s was among non-white minorities. The
   homeownership rate for minorities approached the sixty percent mark in
   2006, which was a significant change because less than half of all
   minority households owned homes as recently as 1994. The ownership rate
   for minorities increased by 25.6%, from 47.7% in 1993 to 59.9% in 2006.
   This rate fell after the 2006 peak, consistent with overall
   homeownership rates.^[8]

   The increase among white Americans was less substantial. In 2005, 75.8%
   of white Americans owned their own homes, compared to 70% in 1993, and
   the rate fell during the last half of the decade of the 2000s, slightly
   more slowly than for the rest of the population. Thus one can conclude
   that despite a large remaining discrepancy between the homeownership
   rates among different racial groups, the gap had been closing up until
   the peak, with ownership rates increasing more substantially for
   minorities than for whites, but subsequently began slightly
   widening.^[8]

Type of household[edit]

   Homeownership rate according to type of household.^[9]

   There is a strong correlation between the type and age of a household's
   family structure and homeownership.^[9] As of 2006, married couple
   families, which also have the highest median income of any household
   type, were most likely to own a home. Age played a significant role as
   well with homeownership increasing with the age of the householder
   until age 65, when a slight decrease becomes visible. While only 43% of
   households with a householder under the age of thirty-five owned a
   home, 81.6% of those with a householder between the ages of 55 and 64
   did.^[9]

   This means that households with a middle-aged householder were nearly
   twice as likely to own a home as those with a young householder.
   Overall married couple families with a householder age 70 to 74 had the
   highest homeownership rate with 93.3% being homeowners. The lowest
   homeownership rate was recorded for single females under the age of
   twenty-five of whom only 13.6%, were homeowners. Yet, single females
   had an overall higher homeownership rate than single males and single
   mothers.^[9]

Income[edit]

   Housing characteristics according to income in 2002.
   Main article: Income in the United States

   There are considerable correlations between income, homeownership rate
   and housing characteristics. As income is closely linked to social
   status, sociologist Leonard Beeghley has made the hypothesis that "the
   lower the social class, then the fewer amenities built into housing."
   According to 2002, US Census Bureau data housing characteristics vary
   considerably with income. For homeowners with middle-range household
   incomes, ranging from $40,000 to $60,000, the median home value was
   $112,000, while the median size was 1,700 square feet (160 m^2) and the
   median year of construction was 1970. A slight majority, 54% of homes
   occupied by owners in this group had two or more bathrooms.^[10]

   Among homeowners with household incomes in the top 10%, those earning
   more than $120,000 a year, home values were considerably higher while
   houses were larger and newer. The median value for homes in this
   demographic was $256,000 while median square footage was 2,500 and the
   median year of construction was 1977. The vast majority, 80%, had two
   or more bathrooms. Overall, houses of those with higher incomes were
   larger, newer, more expensive with more amenities.^[10]
