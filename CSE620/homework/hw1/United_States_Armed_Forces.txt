   The United States Armed Forces^[N 1] are the Federal military forces of
   the United States. They consist of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air
   Force, and Coast Guard.^[7] The United States has a strong tradition of
   civilian control of the military. The President of the United States is
   the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the
   U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department,
   acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.
   The DoD is headed by the Secretary of Defense, who is a civilian and
   Cabinet member. The Defense Secretary is second in the military's chain
   of command, just below the President, and serves as the principal
   assistant to the President in all DoD-related matters.^[8] To
   coordinate military action with diplomacy, the President has an
   advisory National Security Council headed by a National Security
   Advisor. Both the President and Secretary of Defense are advised by a
   seven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which includes the head of each of
   the Defense Department's service branches as well as the chief of the
   National Guard Bureau. Leadership is provided by the Chairman of the
   Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
   Staff.^[9] The Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the
   Joint Chiefs of Staff.

   All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions,
   under the Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the
   Secretary of Defense with the exception of the Coast Guard, which is
   under the administration of the Department of Homeland Security and
   receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland
   Security. However, the Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department
   of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war.^[10] All
   five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the
   United States, the two others being the U.S. Public Health Service
   Commissioned Corps (under the Department of Health and Human Services)
   and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned
   Officer Corps (under the Department of Commerce).

   From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in
   the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and
   identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and
   the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a
   permanent military force and not until the outbreak of World War II did
   a large standing army become officially established. The National
   Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the
   Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act
   merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of
   the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the
   Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and
   created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.

   The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number
   of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid
   volunteers; although conscription has been used in the past in various
   times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of
   2013, the United States spends about $554.2 billion annually to fund
   its military forces, and appropriates approximately $88.5 billion to
   fund Overseas Contingency Operations.^[5] Put together, the United
   States constitutes roughly 39 percent of the world's military
   expenditures. The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities in
   both defense and power projection thanks to its advanced and powerful
   equipment and its widespread deployment of force around the world. As
   such, it is widely accepted that U.S. Armed Forces is the most powerful
   military in the world.^[11]

History[edit]

   Main article: Military history of the United States

   The history of the U.S. military dates to 1775, even before the
   Declaration of Independence marked the establishment of the United
   States. The Continental Army, Continental Navy, and Continental Marines
   were created in close succession by the Second Continental Congress in
   order to defend the new nation against the British Empire in the
   American Revolutionary War.

   These forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the
   War for Independence. The Congress of the Confederation created the
   United States Army on 3 June 1784, and the United States Congress
   created the United States Navy on March 27, 1794, and the United States
   Marine Corps on July 11, 1798. All three services trace their origins
   to the founding of the Continental Army (on 14 June 1775), the
   Continental Navy (on 13 October 1775) and the Continental Marines (on
   10 November 1775), respectively. The 1787 adoption of the Constitution
   gave the Congress the power to "raise and support armies", "provide and
   maintain a navy", and to "make rules for the government and regulation
   of the land and naval forces", as well as the power to declare war. The
   United States President is the U.S. military's commander-in-chief.

   Rising tensions at various times with Britain and France and the
   ensuing Quasi-War and War of 1812 quickened the development of the U.S.
   Navy (established 13 October 1775) and the United States Marine Corps
   (established 10 November 1775). The U.S. Coast Guard dates its origin
   to the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790; that
   service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service in 1915 to
   establish the Coast Guard. The United States Air Force was established
   as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to
   the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1907
   and was part of the Army before becoming an independent service.

   The reserve branches formed a military strategic reserve during the
   Cold War, to be called into service in case of war.^[12]^[13]^[14] Time
   magazine's Mark Thompson has suggested that with the War on Terror, the
   reserves deployed as a single force with the active branches and
   America no longer has a strategic reserve.^[15]^[16]^[17]

Budget[edit]

   Main article: Military budget of the United States
   U.S. military spending from 1910 to 2007, adjusted for inflation to
   2003 dollars. The large spike represents World War II spending.
   American defense spending by GDP percentage 1910 to 2007.

   The United States has the world's largest defense budget. In fiscal
   year 2010, the Department of Defense (DoD) had a base budget of
   $533.8 billion. An additional $130 billion was requested for "Overseas
   Contingency Operations" in the War on Terrorism, and over the course of
   the year, an additional $33 billion in supplemental spending was added
   to Overseas Contingency Operations funding.^[18]^[19] Outside of direct
   DoD spending, the United States spends another $218 to $262 billion
   each year on other defense-related programs, such as Veterans Affairs,
   Homeland Security, nuclear weapons maintenance, and the State
   Department.

   By service, $225.2 billion was allocated for the Army, $171.7 billion
   for the Navy and Marine Corps, $160.5 billion for the Air Force and
   $106.4 billion for defense-wide spending.^[20] By function,
   $154.2 billion was requested for personnel, $283.3 billion for
   operations and maintenance, $140.1 billion for procurement,
   $79.1 billion for research and development, $23.9 billion for military
   construction, and $3.1 billion for family housing.^[21]

   In FY 2009, major defense programs saw continued funding:
     * $4.1 billion was requested for the next-generation fighter, F-22
       Raptor, which was to roll out an additional 20 planes in 2009
     * $6.7 billion was requested for the F-35 Lightning II, which is
       still under development, but 16 planes were slated to be built
     * The Future Combat System program is expected to see $3.6 billion
       for its development.
     * A total of $12.3 billion was requested for missile defense,
       including Patriot CAP, PAC-3 and SBIRS-High.

   Obama's FY 2011 budget proposed a 4% increase in DoD spending, followed
   by a 9% decrease in FY 2012, with funding remaining level for
   subsequent years.

   Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute, has
   blamed the "vast sums of money" squandered on cutting-edge technology
   projects that were then canceled on shortsighted political operatives
   who lack a long-term perspective in setting requirements. The result is
   that the number of items bought under a given program are cut. The
   total development costs of the program are divided over fewer
   platforms, making the per-unit cost seem higher and so the numbers are
   cut again and again in a death spiral.^[22]

   Cost containment measures in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
   Act and the Obama administration's energy policy will play a critical
   determining roles because health care and fuel costs are the two
   fastest-growing segments of the defense budget.^[23]^[24]

Personnel[edit]

   Active duty U.S. military personnel from 1950 to 2003. The two peaks
   correspond to the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

   As of 31 December 2013, 1,369,532 people were on active duty in the
   armed forces,^[4] with an additional 850,880 people in the seven
   reserve components.^[5] It is an all-volunteer military, but
   conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted at the
   President's request and Congress' approval. All males ages 18 through
   25 who are living in the United States are required to register with
   the Selective Service for a potential future draft.

   The U.S. military is the world's second largest, after China's People's
   Liberation Army, and has troops deployed around the globe.

   From 1776 until September 2012, a total of 40 million Americans have
   served in the United States Armed Forces.^[25]

   In early 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed an increase
   in the overall size of the Army and Marine Corps to meet the needs of
   the War on Terrorism.^[26] Current plans are to increase the Army to
   547,400 and the Marine Corps to 202,000 by 2012. The expansion will
   cost a total of $90.7 billion between 2009 and 2013 as the Navy and Air
   Force undergo a limited force reduction.^[27] In addition, in 2009,
   Gates proposed increasing the size of the Army by 22,000 troops in
   order to reduce fatigue from multiple trips overseas, and to compensate
   for troops who are in recovery away from their units.^[citation needed]
   The FY 2011 DoD budget request^[28] plan calls for an active military
   end strength of 1.4 million, an increase of 77,500 from the 2007
   baseline as a result of increments in the Army (65,000 more troops) and
   Marine Corps (27,100 more troops) strength and decrements in the Navy
   (13,300 fewer troops) and Air Force (1,300 fewer troops) strength.

   As in most militaries, members of the U.S. military hold a rank, either
   that of officer, warrant, or enlisted, to determine seniority and
   eligibility for promotion. Those who have served are known as veterans.
   Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to
   each other by their corresponding paygrade.^[29] Officers who hold the
   same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to
   determine seniority, while officers who serve in certain positions of
   office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers in active
   duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of
   rank.^[30] Due to a declining supply of qualified recruits, the
   differing needs of the U.S. education system and the military, and the
   quality of primary and secondary education in the United States, the
   armed forces have considered seeking foreign recruits who are qualified
   in math and science by offering accelerated citizenship for
   example.^[31] Currently, only one in four Americans of the proper age
   meet the moral, academic and physical standards for military
   service.^[32]

   operations—i.e., Iraq and Afghanistan.^[37] As of March 2011, there
   were 18,971 private security contractor (PSC) personnel in Afghanistan
   working for DoD; in Iraq, there were 9,207 PSC personnel, down from a
   high of 15,279 in June 2009.^[38] As of October 2012, in Afghanistan,
   there were 18,914 PSC personnel working for DoD; in Iraq, there were
   2,116 PSC personnel.^[39] The total number of DoD contractors in Iraq
   and Afghanistan was more than 137,400; reported PSCs were only a part
   of the number.

Personnel stationing[edit]

   Main article: United States military deployments

Overseas[edit]

   See also: United States military presence in other countries

   As of 31 December 2010, U.S. armed forces were stationed in 150
   countries; the number of non-contingent deployments per country ranges
   from 1 in Suriname to over 50,000 in Germany.^[40] Some of the largest
   deployments are: 103,700 in Afghanistan, 52,440 in Germany (see list),
   35,688 in Japan (USFJ), 28,500 in South Korea (USFK), 9,660 in Italy,
   and 9,015 in the United Kingdom. These numbers change frequently due to
   the regular recall and deployment of units.

   Altogether, 77,917 military personnel are located in Europe, 141 in the
   former Soviet Union, 47,236 in East Asia and the Pacific, 3,362 in
   North Africa, the Near East, and South Asia, 1,355 in sub-Saharan
   Africa and 1,941 in the Western Hemisphere excluding the United States
   itself.

Within the United States[edit]

   Including U.S. territories and ships afloat within territorial waters

   As of 31 December 2009, a total of 1,137,568 personnel were on active
   duty within the United States and its territories (including 84,461
   afloat).^[41] The vast majority (941,629 personnel) were stationed at
   bases within the contiguous United States. There were an additional
   37,245 in Hawaii and 20,450 in Alaska; 84,461 were at sea, 2,972 in
   Guam, and 179 in Puerto Rico.

Types of personnel[edit]

Enlisted[edit]

   U. S. Armed Forces Career Center in Times Square.
   Service members of the U.S. at an American football event, L-R: U.S.
   Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Army personnel.

   Prospective service members are often recruited from high school or
   college, the target age ranges being 18–35 in the Army, 18–28 in the
   Marine Corps, 18–34 in the Navy, 18–27 in the Air Force, and 18–27 (up
   to age 32 if qualified for attending guaranteed "A" school) in the
   Coast Guard. With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants
   can enlist at age 17 and participate in the Delayed Entry Program
   (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate
   in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports
   to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each
   recruiting station's DEP varies).

   After enlistment, new recruits undergo basic training (also known as
   "boot camp" in the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard), followed by
   schooling in their primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) or
   rating at any of the numerous training facilities around the world.
   Each branch conducts basic training differently. Marines send all
   non-infantry MOS’s to an infantry skills course known as Marine Combat
   Training prior to their technical schools. Air Force Basic Military
   Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded an Air
   Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the apprentice (3) skill level. All Army
   recruits undergo Basic Combat Training (BCT), followed by Advanced
   Individual Training (AIT), with the exceptions of infantry, combat
   engineers, and military police recruits who go to One Station Unit
   Training (OSUT), which combines BCT and AIT. The Navy sends its
   recruits to Recruit Training and then to "A" schools to earn a rating.
   The Coast Guard's recruits attend basic training and follow with an "A"
   school to earn a rating.

   Initially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will
   hold the pay grade of E-1, and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon
   after basic training. Different services have different incentive
   programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college
   credit, being an Eagle Scout, and referring friends who go on to enlist
   as well. Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank
   before their departure to basic training.

   There are several different authorized pay grade advancement
   requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which
   differ by service. Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay
   grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest
   initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can
   expect to enter service at the grade of E-4). Promotion through the
   junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of
   years (which, however, can be waived by the soldier's chain of
   command), a specified level of technical proficiency, or maintenance of
   good conduct. Promotion can be denied with reason.

Non-commissioned officers[edit]

   With very few exceptions, becoming a non-commissioned officer (NCO) in
   the U.S. military is accomplished by progression through the lower
   enlisted ranks. However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted
   tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive. NCO ranks begin at E-4
   or E-5, depending upon service, and are generally attained between
   three and six years of service. Junior NCOs function as first-line
   supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their
   duties and guiding their career advancement.

   While considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law,
   senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as chief petty
   officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned
   officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership
   rather than technical expertise. Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7
   through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly
   competitive. Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are
   limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's
   enlisted force, respectively. SNCOs act as leaders of small units and
   as staff. Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select
   few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military
   structure. Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor. All
   SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as
   the enlisted in their duty sections. The typical enlistee can expect to
   attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16 years of service.

   Each of the five services employs a single Senior Enlisted Advisor at
   departmental level. This individual is the highest ranking enlisted
   member within his/her respective service and functions as the chief
   advisor to the service secretary, service chief of staff, and Congress
   on matters concerning the enlisted force. These individuals carry
   responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to three-star
   general and flag officers. They are as follows:
     * Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman
     * Sergeant Major of the Army
     * Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps
     * Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy
     * Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
     * Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard

Warrant officers[edit]

   Additionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active
   warrant-officer corps. Above the rank of Warrant Officer One, these
   officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more
   technical and specialized role within units. More recently though they
   can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the
   more recognizable officer corps. With one notable exception (Army
   helicopter and fixed-wing pilots), these officers ordinarily have
   already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in
   the field in which they later serve as a Warrant Officer as a technical
   expert. Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time. It is also
   possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the Warrant
   Officer Candidate school at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and then on to flight
   school.

   Warrant officers in the U.S. military garner the same customs and
   courtesies as commissioned officers. They may attend the officer's
   club, receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and
   all enlisted service members.

   The Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the grades of E-8
   and E-9 were created. Most non-flying duties performed by warrant
   officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the
   Air Force.

Commissioned officers[edit]

   There are five common ways to receive a commission as an officer in one
   of the branches of the U.S. military (although other routes are
   possible).
     * Service academies (United States Military Academy in West Point,
       New York; United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland;
       United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado; the
       United States Coast Guard Academy at New London, Connecticut; and
       the United States Merchant Marine Academy at King's Point, New
       York)
     * Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)
     * Officer Candidate School (OCS): This can be through active-duty OCS
       academies, or through state-run academies in the case of the
       National Guard.
     * Direct commission: civilians who have special skills that are
       critical to sustaining military operations and supporting troops
       may receive direct commissions. These officers occupy leadership
       positions in law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nurse corps,
       intelligence, supply-logistics-transportation, engineering, public
       affairs, chaplain corps, oceanography, and others.
     * Battlefield commission: Under certain conditions, enlisted
       personnel who have skills that separate them from their peers can
       become officers by direct commissioning of a commander so
       authorized to grant them. This type of commission is rarely granted
       and is reserved only for the most exceptional enlisted personnel;
       it is done on an ad hoc basis, typically only in wartime. No direct
       battlefield commissions have been awarded since the Vietnam War.
       The Air Force and Navy do not employ this commissioning path.
     * Limited Duty Officer: Due to the highly technical nature of some
       officer billets, the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard employs a
       system of promoting proven senior enlisted members to the ranks of
       commissioned officers. They fill a need that is similar to, but
       distinct from that filled by Warrant Officers (to the point where
       their accession is through the same school). While Warrant Officers
       remain technical experts, LDOs take on the role of a generalist,
       like that of officers commissioned through more traditional
       sources. LDOs are limited, not by their authority, but by the types
       of billets they are allowed to fill. However, in recent times, they
       have come to be used more and more like their more-traditional
       counterparts.

   Officers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from
   the president with the Senate's consent. To accept this commission, all
   officers must take an oath of office.

   Through their careers, officers usually will receive further training
   at one or a number of the many staff colleges.

   Company grade officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (known as "junior"
   officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) function as leaders of smaller
   units or sections of a unit, typically with an experienced SNCO (or CPO
   in the Navy and Coast Guard) assistant and mentor.

   Field grade officers in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (known as "senior"
   officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) lead significantly larger and
   more complex operations, with gradually more competitive promotion
   requirements.

   General officers, or flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, serve
   at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military
   mission.

Five-star ranking[edit]

   Main article: Five-star rank

   These are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the armed
   forces, but they are almost never given during peacetime and only a
   very small number of officers during wartime have held a five-star
   rank:
     * General of the Army
     * Fleet Admiral
     * General of the Air Force

   No corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps or the Coast Guard.
   As with three- and four-star ranks, Congress is the approving authority
   for a five-star rank confirmation.

   The rank of General of the Armies is considered senior to General of
   the Army, but was never held by active duty officers at the same time
   as persons who held the rank of General of the Army. It has been held
   by two people: John J. Pershing who received the rank in 1919 after
   World War I, and George Washington who received it posthumously in 1976
   as part of the American Bicentennial celebrations. Pershing, appointed
   to General of the Armies in active duty status for life, was still
   alive at the time of the first five-star appointments during World
   War II, and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority
   to any World War II–era Generals of the Army. George Washington's
   appointment by Public Law 94-479 to General of the Armies of the United
   States was established by law as having "rank and precedence over all
   other grades of the Army, past or present", making him not only
   superior to Pershing, but superior to any grade in the Army in
   perpetuity.

   In the Navy, the rank of Admiral of the Navy theoretically corresponds
   to that of General of the Armies, though it was never held by
   active-duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of
   Fleet Admiral. George Dewey is the only person to have ever held this
   rank. After the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral in 1944, the
   Department of the Navy specified that the rank of Fleet Admiral was to
   be junior to the rank of Admiral of the Navy. However, since Dewey died
   in 1917 before the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral, the
   six-star rank has not been totally confirmed.

Order of precedence[edit]

   Under current Department of Defense regulation, the various components
   of the Armed Forces have a set order of seniority. Examples of the use
   of this system include the display of service flags, placement of
   Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, and Airmen in formation, etc. When the
   Coast Guard shall operate as part of the Navy, the cadets, United
   States Coast Guard Academy, the United States Coast Guard, and the
   Coast Guard Reserve shall take precedence, respectively, after the
   midshipmen, United States Naval Academy; the United States Navy; and
   Navy Reserve.^[42]
     * Cadets, U.S. Military Academy
     * Midshipmen, U.S. Naval Academy
     * Cadets, U.S. Coast Guard Academy (when part of the Navy)
     * Cadets, U.S. Air Force Academy
     * Cadets, U.S. Coast Guard Academy (when part of the Department of
       Homeland Security)
     * Midshipmen, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy
     * United States Army
     * United States Marine Corps
     * United States Navy
     * United States Coast Guard (when part of the Navy)
     * United States Air Force
     * United States Coast Guard (when part of Homeland Security)
     * Army National Guard of the United States
     * United States Army Reserve
     * United States Marine Corps Reserve
     * United States Navy Reserve
     * United States Coast Guard Reserve (when part of the Navy)
     * Air National Guard of the United States
     * United States Air Force Reserve
     * United States Coast Guard Reserve (when part of Homeland Security)
     * Other training and auxiliary organizations of the Army, Marine
       Corps, Merchant Marine, Civil Air Patrol, and Coast Guard
       Auxiliary, as in the preceding order. However, the Civil Air Patrol
       actually predates the Air Force as an independent service. The CAP
       was constituted through the Administrative Order 9 of 1 December
       1941 and operated under the U.S. Army Air Forces during World
       War II. The CAP became the official civilian auxiliary of the newly
       independent USAF with the enactment of Public Law 80-557 on 26 May
       1948.

   Note: While the U.S. Navy is older than the Marine Corps,^[43] the
   Marine Corps takes precedence due to previous inconsistencies in the
   Navy's birth date. The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth
   date on a more consistent basis. The Second Continental Congress
   established the Navy on 13 October 1775 and the Marine Corps on 10
   November 1775. The Navy did not officially recognize 13 October 1775 as
   its birth date until 1972 when, then-Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral
   Elmo Zumwalt authorized it to be observed as such.^[43]
