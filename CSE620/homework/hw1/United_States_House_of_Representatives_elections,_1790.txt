   Elections to the House of Representatives for the 2nd Congress took
   place in 1790 and 1791, in the middle of President George Washington's
   first term. While formal political parties still did not exist,
   coalitions of pro-Washington (pro-Administration) representatives and
   anti-Administration representatives each gained two seats as a result
   of the addition of new states to the union. Speaker Frederick
   Muhlenberg, who had led the Pro-Administrationists in 1789, switched
   loyalties to the Anti-Administrationists during the tenure of the 1st
   Congress. He failed to win election to the Speakership as their leader
   as a result of these elections, and was succeeded by Jonathan Trumbull,
   Jr., who became the 2nd Speaker of the House.

Election summaries[edit]

   In this period, each state fixed its own date for congressional general
   elections, as early as April 27, 1790 (in New York) and as late as
   October 11, 1791 (in Pennsylvania). Elections to a Congress took place
   both in the even-numbered year before and in the odd-numbered year when
   the Congress convened. In some states, the congressional delegation was
   not elected until after the legal start of the Congress (on the 4th day
   of March in the odd-numbered year). The first session of this Congress
   was convened in Philadelphia on October 24, 1791.

   Kentucky and Vermont became states during the 2nd Congress, adding two
   seats each.^[4] The legislation admitted Vermont was passed at the end
   of the 1st Congress taking effect on March 4, 1791, the first day of
   the 2nd Congress, so that Vermont was represented from the start of the
   Congress, while Kentucky was unrepresented until the 2nd session.

   North Carolina and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution on November
   21, 1789, and May 29, 1790, respectively. Neither state elected
   congressional representatives until after their admission to the union.

   The 5th district (or Western Division) covered areas beyond the
   Appalachian Mountains that were ceded to the federal government in May
   1790 to form the Southwest Territory (later the State of Tennessee)
   during the 1st Congress. John Sevier, who held the seat for the 5th
   district, was permitted to retain his seat for the remainder of the 1st
   Congress in spite of the fact that the territory he represented was no
   longer part of a state. North Carolina would subsequently re-district
   to choose representatives for the 2nd Congress.

Massachusetts[edit]

   Main article: United States House of Representatives elections in

   condition was met in four of the eight districts, the remaining four
   required between 2 and 8 ballots for election. Only the first and last
   are listed in this section to conserve space. Information on the
   intermediate ballots are available at United States House of

North Carolina[edit]

   Due to the cession of North Carolina's trans-Appalachian territory to
   form the Southwest Territory, the territory of the old 5th district was
   lost. North Carolina retained the same number of Representatives, and
   so it redistricted for the Second Congress.

   Pennsylvania had elected its Representatives at-large in the 1st
   Congress, but switched to using districts in the 2nd Congress. Five
   incumbents ran for re-election, four of whom won, while three others
   retired leaving three open seats. Two districts had no incumbents
   residing in them, while one (the 8th) had a single representative who
   declined to run for re-election and one (the 2nd) had three incumbents,
   only one of whom ran for re-election.

Vermont[edit]

   Vermont was admitted at the end of the First Congress, with the
   admission taking effect at the start of the Second Congress. Vermont
   was entitled to elect two representatives. Vermont law at the time
   required a majority to win an office. In the 1st district, no candidate

   John Brown of the 2nd district resigned June 1, 1792 after being
   elected as Senator for the new state of Kentucky. The territory he
   represented covered the area that had been admitted as Kentucky (which
   was entitled to two seats), and therefore his seat was left vacant.
