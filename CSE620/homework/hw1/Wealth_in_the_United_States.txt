   Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth,
   which is the sum of all assets, including the market value of real
   estate, like a home, minus all liabilities.^[1]
   The total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations
   1945–2009, unadjusted for inflation or population change.

   For example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in
   mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own
   company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000.
   Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in
   car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total
   $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's
   assets (900,000 - $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net
   worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the
   underlying assets.

   The wealth—more specifically, the median net worth—of households in the
   United States is varied with relation to race, education, geographic
   location and gender. As one would expect, households with greater
   income feature the highest net worths, though high income cannot be
   taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth. Overall the number
   of wealthier households is on the rise, with baby boomers hitting the
   highs of their careers.^[1] In addition, wealth is unevenly
   distributed, with the wealthiest 25% of US households owning 87%^[2] of
   the wealth in the United States, which was $54.2 trillion in
   2009.^[3]^[4]

   Including human capital such as skills, the United Nations estimated
   the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $118
   trillion.^[5]^[6]

Income vs. wealth[edit]

   Main article: Household income in the United States

   While income is often seen as a type of wealth in colloquial language
   use, wealth and income are two substantially different measures of
   economic prosperity. While there may be a high correlation between
   income and wealth, the relationship cannot be described as causal.

Changes in wealth, 1989–2001[edit]

   Year-on-year change in total net worth of US households and nonprofit
   organizations 1946–2007, unadjusted for inflation or population change.

   When observing the changes in the wealth among American households, one
   can note an increase in wealthier individuals and a decrease in the
   number of poor households, while net worth increased most substantially
   in semi-wealthy and wealthy households. Overall the percentage of
   households with a negative net worth (more debt than assets) declined
   from 9.5% in 1989 to 4.1% in 2001.^[1]

   The percentage of net worths ranging from $500,000 to one million
   doubled while the percentage of millionaires tripled.^[1] From 1995 to
   2004, there was tremendous growth among household wealth, as it nearly
   doubled from $21.9 trillion to $43.6 trillion, but the wealthiest
   quartile of the economic distribution made up 89% of this growth.^[3]
   During this time frame, wealth became increasingly unequal, and the
   wealthiest 25% became even wealthier.

   According to US Census Bureau statistics this "Upward shift" is most
   likely the result of a booming housing market which caused homeowners
   to experience tremendous increases in home equity. Life-cycles have
   also attributed to the rising wealth among Americans. With more and
   more baby-boomers reaching the climax of their careers and the middle
   aged population making up a larger segment of the population now than
   ever before, more and more households have achieved comfortable levels
   of wealth.^[1] Zhu Xiao Di (2004) notes that household wealth usually
   peaks around families headed by people in their 50s, and as a result,
   the baby boomer generation reached this age range at the time of the
   analysis.^[3]

Changes in wealth after 2007[edit]

   Household net worth fell from 2007 to 2009 by a total of $17.5 trillion
   or 25.5%. This was the equivalent loss of one year of GDP.^[7] By the
   fourth quarter of 2010, the household net worth had recovered by a
   growth of 1.3 percent to a total of $56.8 trillion. An additional
   growth of 15.7 percent is needed just to bring the value to where it
   was before the recession started in December 2007.^[2]

Mechanisms to gain wealth[edit]

   Assets are known as the raw materials of wealth, and they consist
   primarily of stocks and other financial and non-financial property,
   particularly homeownership.^[8] While these assets are unequally
   distributed, financial assets are much more unequal. In 2004, the top
   1% controlled 50.3% of the financial assets while the bottom 90% only
   held 14.4% of the total US financial assets.^[8]

   These discrepancies exist despite the availability of many wealth
   building tools established by the Federal Government. These include
   401k plans, 403b plans, and IRAs. Traditional IRAs, 401k and 403b plans
   are tax shelters created for working individuals. These plans allow for
   tax sheltered (or pre-tax) contributions of earned income directly to
   tax sheltered savings accounts. Annual contributions are capped to
   ensure that high earners cannot enjoy the tax benefit proportionally.
   The Roth IRA is another tool that can help create wealth in the working
   and middle classes.

   Assets in Roth IRAs grow tax free; interests, dividends, and capital
   gains are all exempt from income taxes. Contributions to Roth IRAs are
   limited to those with annual incomes less than the threshold
   established yearly by the IRS. The benefits of these plans, however,
   are only available to workers and families whose incomes and expenses
   allow them excess funds to commit for a long period, typically until
   the investor reaches age 59½. The effect of these tools are further
   limited by the contribution limits placed on them.

Wealth distribution[edit]

   The distribution of net wealth in the United States, 2007. The chart is
   divided into the top 20% (blue), upper middle 20% (orange), middle 20%
   (red), and bottom 40% (green).^[9]

   In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the
   country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20%
   of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of
   the population owned 15%. Financial inequality was greater than
   inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning
   42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80%
   owning 7%.^[10]

   After the Great Recession which started in 2007, the share of total
   wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%,
   and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The
   Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth
   but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%.^[9]^[10]^[11]

Income distribution[edit]

   Further information: Income in the United States

   Note: The IRS specifically warned that changes in their definition of
   Adjusted Gross Income makes it impossible to compare pre-1987 AGI with
   post-1987 AGI, so keep in mind that comparisons should be in gross
   income or salary and not in AGI. When reading statistics, it behooves
   the reader to have this awareness. According to the Congressional
   Budget Office, between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans
   grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of
   Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by
   40%. From 1992-2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their
   income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%.^[12] In
   2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum
   income of $343,927.^[13]^[14]^[15]

   During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the
   top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this
   period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a
   larger share of total income than at any time since 1928.^[14]
   According to PolitiFact and others, the top 400 wealthiest Americans
   "have more wealth than half of all Americans
   combined."^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19] Inherited wealth may help explain why
   many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head
   start".^[20]^[21] In September 2012, according to the Institute for
   Policy Studies, "over 60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans
   "grew up in substantial privilege".^[22]

Complications in interpreting income statistics[edit]

   Interpreting these income statistics is complicated by several factors:
   membership in the top 1% changes from year to year, the IRS made large
   changes in the definition of adjusted gross income in 1987, and numbers
   for particular income ranges may be distorted by outliers (in the top
   segment) and failure to include transfer payments (in the lower
   segments). Income Mobility: The IRS occasionally studies income data
   from actual households over time, usually over one decade. They
   actually underestimate income mobility by excluding the most mobile
   population from their studies: those under age 25.

   Most people only look at annual reported income data split into income
   quintiles. But those data are less useful because income group members
   change every year. A majority of households in the top income quintile
   in one year, for example, will have moved to a lower quintile within a
   decade. Three out of four households in the top 0.01% of income will no
   longer be in that small group ten years later. In summary, half of all
   of U.S. households move from one income quintile to a different income
   quintile every decade. And actual households who started a decade in
   the lowest quintile of income, when tracked over the next ten years,
   will have proportionally more income growth than actual households who
   started the decade in the highest quintile of income....

   Top 20% income vs. Bottom 20% income households: (1) The average number
   of people with jobs in a top income quintile household is two, while a
   majority of bottom income quintile households have no one employed. (2)
   If there are two adult income earners in a household who are married,
   their incomes are combined on tax forms. This is very common among top
   quintile income households. The lowest quintile households, however,
   include a lot more single-person households, or two unmarried working
   adults living together, and sharing expenses, but reporting their
   incomes to the IRS as if they were two separate households. (3) 75% to
   80% of the actual income for bottom quintile households is transfer
   payments (aka “welfare”) that are not included in IRS income data. The
   top income quintile gets a very small percentage of their actual income
   from transfer payments.

   (4) The IRS warns against comparisons of pre-1987 and post-1987 income
   data due to significant changes in the definition of adjusted gross
   income (AGI) that made top quintile households appear to have large
   reported income gains, when in fact there was no change to their income
   at all. In addition to the AGI changes, large marginal tax rate
   reductions during the Reagan Administration caused another large change
   in tax reporting. A lot of corporate income formerly reported on
   corporate tax returns was switched to lower tax rate individual tax
   returns (as Subchapter S corporations). This reporting change appeared
   to boost top quintile income, when in fact their incomes had not
   changed. As a result, the top income quintile for households today
   includes a lot of corporate income previously reported in corporate tax
   returns, while Subchapter S corporations who lose money are likely to
   be included in the bottom income quintile households. Income
   comparisons that compare pre-1987 to post-1987 income are very common,
   but they are also biased, according to the IRS, and should be ignored.

Home ownership and race[edit]

   Home ownership is one of the main sources of wealth among families in
   the United States.

Statistics[edit]

     * Family net worth
     * U.S. mean family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)
     * U.S. median family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)

   The total value of all U.S. household wealth in 2000 was approximately
   $44 trillion. Prior to the Late-2000s recession which began in December
   2007 its value was at $65.9 trillion. After, it plunged to $48.5
   trillion during the first quarter of 2009. The total household net
   worth rose 1.3% by the fourth quarter of 2009 to $54.2 trillion,
   indicating the American economy is recovering.
