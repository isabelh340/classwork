Professional and working class conflict in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Violent confrontation between working class union members and law
   enforcement such as the one between teamsters and Minneapolis police
   above were commonly frowned upon by professional middle class.

   In the United States there has long been a conflict between the working
   class majority and the professional class. The conflict goes back to
   the workers revolution and age of unionized labor in the late
   nineteenth century. Since the 1870s and the rise of professionalism the
   daily routine of American workers has been largely designed by
   professionals instead of foremen.

   Today, most American workers many of whom earn middle-range incomes and
   work in white collar occupations, are usually not resentful of the
   professionals though a feeling of disconnect persists. Even nowadays
   there is a large visible discrepancy between professionals whose main
   job duties include visualizing and directing the day of other workers
   and those who carry out the orders. While the work of professionals and
   managers is usually largely self-directed and appeals to the interest
   of the individual, that of middle-range income white collar and working
   class blue collar workers is closely supervised and tends to greatly
   stray from the worker's actual interests.

   Yet another reason for professional middle class resentment among the
   working class stems from the embedded feelings of anti-intellectualism.
   When combined working class workers seem to often be under the
   impression that their better paid, professional managers are not
   actually "doing anything" as most of their duties are to conceptualize
   and outline their ideas.^[1]

The student movement[edit]

   In the 1960s tensions between the professional middle class and Upper
   class flared up again. The student protestors, many of whom were
   criminals and had deferments and were therefore exempt from fighting in
   the Vietnam War, were almost without exception the youth of the
   professional middle class. Even though the student protestors used
   solidarity towards the working class as the means to rebel against the
   "establishment" of the professional middle class, the student
   protestor's unwillingness to fight in the Vietnam War, as well as the
   widespread non-patriotic sentiment alienated the working classes.

Current disconnect[edit]

   & Bacon. The upper middle class may also be referred to as

   Middle Class. NY, NY: Harper-Colins.

   In modern day America, a common view among some members of the working
   class or less privileged members of the statistical middle class is
   that while the professional middle class is paid better, they are less
   directly involved in the production of goods and services than those of
   the working class. This difference in pay coupled with the impression
   that professionalas and managers are less hands-on in their work often
   evokes an image of unearned privilege on part of professional in the
   minds of working class persons. Conversely, the fact that working class
   persons generally work with their hands may lead those of the
   middle-class to assume that those of the working class are incapable of
   abstract, intellectual reasoning. One must also consider that most
   professionals tend to work in their fields of interest; thus work may
   not be as perceived as dreadful and menial by them. For working class
   persons, however, the contrary may be true. This difference in job
   satisfaction tends to be perceived by working class persons as further
   proof of unearned privileged among their professional managers, further
   adding to class tension.^[1]^[2]

   Additionally many middle-class persons lack direct experience in
   relating to working-class persons outside of a formal workplace
   environment. Commonly the interactions between both classes are subject
   to rather strict social norms which tend to put the professional in a
   position that is perceived as one of entitled authority over the
   working class individual. Examples other interactions between both
   classes other than the rather iconic worker/manager interaction include
   that of consultations with physicians or therapists. Author Barbara
   Ehrenreich suggests that these relationships will often lead to the
   unconscious assumption of class privilege on the part of middle-class
   individuals in their dealings with members of the working class.
   “ "Relative to the working class, the holders of middle class
     occupations are in positions of command or, at the very least
     authority. Their job is to conceptualize, in broad terms, what others
     must do. The job of the worker... is to get it done. The fact that this
     is a relationship of domination-and grudging submission-is usually
     invisible to the [professional] middle class but painfully apparent to
     the working class." -Barbara Ehrenreich                                ”

   Overall working class Americans are most likely to encounter a
   professional middle class persons in a situation where the latter
   either directs or advises the former. Meaning that working class
   persons usually do not converse with professionals unless they are
   receiving instructions or being given advice. Likewise, members of the
   contemporary middle class are increasingly unlikely to interact with
   working-class persons outside of a supervisor/employee setting, and
   will rarely attempt to know or relate to working-class individuals as
   individuals. These circumstances might lead to the development of
   classism. ^[1]^[2]
