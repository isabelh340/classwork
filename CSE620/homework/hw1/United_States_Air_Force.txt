   The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch
   of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American
   uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF
   was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947
   under the National Security Act of 1947.^[5] It is the most recent
   branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of
   the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF
   articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations,
   Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space
   Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel
   Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global
   Mobility and Agile Combat Support.^[6]

   The U.S. Air Force is a military service within the Department of the
   Air Force, one of the three military departments of the Department of
   Defense. The USAF is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Air Force,
   who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the
   Senate. The highest-ranking military officer in the Department of the
   Air Force is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force who exercises
   supervision over Air Force units, and serves as a member of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff. Air Force combat forces are assigned, as directed by
   the Secretary of Defense, to the Combatant Commanders, and neither the
   Secretary of the Air Force nor the Chief of Staff have operational
   command authority over them.

   The U.S. Air Force provides air support for surface forces^[7] and aids
   in the recovery of troops in the field. As of 2012^[update], the
   service operates more than 5,638 aircraft, 450 ICBMs and 63 satellites.
   It has a $140 billion budget with 332,854 active personnel, 185,522
   civilian personnel, 71,400 reserve personnel, and 106,700 air guard
   personnel.^[2]

Mission, vision, and functions[edit]

Mission[edit]

   According to the National Security Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 502), which
   created the USAF:

          In general the United States Air Force shall include aviation
          forces both combat and service not otherwise assigned. It shall
          be organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt and
          sustained offensive and defensive air operations. The Air Force
          shall be responsible for the preparation of the air forces
          necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as
          otherwise assigned and, in accordance with integrated joint
          mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime
          components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war.

   §8062 of Title 10 US Code defines the purpose of the USAF as:^[8]
     * to preserve the peace and security, and provide for the defense, of
       the United States, the Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions,
       and any areas occupied by the United States;
     * to support national policy;
     * to implement national objectives;
     * to overcome any nations responsible for aggressive acts that
       imperil the peace and security of the United States.

   The stated mission of the USAF today is to "fly, fight, and win in air,
   space, and cyberspace".^[9]

Vision[edit]

   "The United States Air Force will be a trusted and reliable joint
   partner with our sister services known for integrity in all of our
   activities, including supporting the joint mission first and foremost.
   We will provide compelling air, space, and cyber capabilities for use
   by the combatant commanders. We will excel as stewards of all Air Force
   resources in service to the American people, while providing precise
   and reliable Global Vigilance, Reach and Power for the nation".^[9]

Core functions[edit]

   Recently the Air Force refined its understanding of the core duties and
   responsibilities it performs as a Military Service Branch, streamlining
   what previously were six distinctive capabilities and seventeen
   operational functions into twelve core functions to be used across the
   doctrine, organization, training, equipment, leadership, and education,
   personnel, and facilities spectrum. These core functions express the
   ways in which the Air Force is particularly and appropriately suited to
   contribute to national security, but they do not necessarily express
   every aspect of what the Air Force contributes to the nation. It should
   be emphasized that the core functions, by themselves, are not doctrinal
   constructs.^[10]

Nuclear Deterrence Operations[edit]

   The purpose of Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is to operate,
   maintain, and secure nuclear forces to achieve an assured capability to
   deter an adversary from taking action against vital US interests. In
   the event deterrence fails, the US should be able to appropriately
   respond with nuclear options. The sub-elements of this function
   are:^[10]

   Assure/Dissuade/Deter is a mission set derived from the Air Force's
   readiness to carry out the nuclear strike operations mission as well as
   from specific actions taken to assure allies as a part of extended
   deterrence. Dissuading others from acquiring or proliferating WMD, and
   the means to deliver them, contributes to promoting security and is
   also an integral part of this mission. Moreover, different deterrence
   strategies are required to deter various adversaries, whether they are
   a nation state, or non-state/transnational actor. The Air Force
   maintains and presents credible deterrent capabilities through
   successful visible demonstrations and exercises which assure allies,
   dissuade proliferation, deter potential adversaries from actions that
   threaten US national security or the populations and deployed military
   forces of the US, its allies and friends.^[10]

   Nuclear strike is the ability of nuclear forces to rapidly and
   accurately strike targets which the enemy holds dear in a devastating
   manner. If a crisis occurs, rapid generation and, if necessary,
   deployment of nuclear strike capabilities will demonstrate US resolve
   and may prompt an adversary to alter the course of action deemed
   threatening to our national interest. Should deterrence fail, the
   President may authorize a precise, tailored response to terminate the
   conflict at the lowest possible level and lead to a rapid cessation of
   hostilities. Post-conflict, regeneration of a credible nuclear
   deterrent capability will deter further aggression. The Air Force may
   present a credible force posture in either the Continental United
   States, within a theater of operations, or both to effectively deter
   the range of potential adversaries envisioned in the 21st century. This
   requires the ability to engage targets globally using a variety of
   methods; therefore, the Air Force should possess the ability to induct,
   train, assign, educate and exercise individuals and units to rapidly
   and effectively execute missions that support US NDO objectives.
   Finally, the Air Force regularly exercises and evaluates all aspects of
   nuclear operations to ensure high levels of performance.^[10]

   Nuclear surety ensures the safety, security and effectiveness of
   nuclear operations. Because of their political and military importance,
   destructive power, and the potential consequences of an accident or
   unauthorized act, nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems require
   special consideration and protection against risks and threats inherent
   in their peacetime and wartime environments. The Air Force, in
   conjunction with other entities within the Departments of Defense or
   Energy, achieves a high standard of protection through a stringent
   nuclear surety program. This program applies to materiel, personnel,
   and procedures that contribute to the safety, security, and control of
   nuclear weapons, thus assuring no nuclear accidents, incidents, loss,
   or unauthorized or accidental use (a Broken Arrow incident). The Air
   Force continues to pursue safe, secure and effective nuclear weapons
   consistent with operational requirements. Adversaries, allies, and the
   American people must be highly confident of the Air Force's ability to
   secure nuclear weapons from accidents, theft, loss, and accidental or
   unauthorized use. This day-to-day commitment to precise and reliable
   nuclear operations is the cornerstone of the credibility of the NDO
   mission. Positive nuclear command, control, communications; effective
   nuclear weapons security; and robust combat support are essential to
   the overall NDO function.^[10]

Air Superiority[edit]

   Air Superiority is "that degree of dominance in the air battle of one
   force over another which permits the conduct of operations by the
   former and its related land, sea, air, and special operations forces at
   a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing
   force" (JP 1-02).^[10]

   Offensive Counterair (OCA) is defined as "offensive operations to
   destroy, disrupt, or neutralize enemy aircraft, missiles, launch
   platforms, and their supporting structures and systems both before and
   after launch, but as close to their source as possible" (JP 1-02). OCA
   is the preferred method of countering air and missile threats, since it
   attempts to defeat the enemy closer to its source and typically enjoys
   the initiative. OCA comprises attack operations, sweep, escort, and
   suppression/destruction of enemy air defense.^[10]

   Defensive Counterair (DCA) is defined as "all the defensive measures
   designed to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy or negate enemy
   forces attempting to penetrate or attack through friendly airspace" (JP
   1-02). A major goal of DCA operations, in concert with OCA operations,
   is to provide an area from which forces can operate, secure from air
   and missile threats. The DCA mission comprises both active and passive
   defense measures. Active defense is "the employment of limited
   offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or
   position to the enemy" (JP 1-02). It includes both ballistic missile
   defense and air breathing threat defense, and encompasses point
   defense, area defense, and high value airborne asset defense. Passive
   defense is "measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize
   the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of
   taking the initiative" (JP 1-02). It includes detection and warning;
   chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense; camouflage,
   concealment, and deception; hardening; reconstitution; dispersion;
   redundancy; and mobility, counter-measures, and stealth.^[10]

   Airspace control is "a process used to increase operational
   effectiveness by promoting the safe, efficient, and flexible use of
   airspace" (JP 1-02). It promotes the safe, efficient, and flexible use
   of airspace, mitigates the risk of fratricide, enhances both offensive
   and defensive operations, and permits greater agility of air operations
   as a whole. It both deconflicts and facilitates integration of joint
   air operations.^[10]

Space Superiority[edit]

   Space superiority is "the degree of dominance in space of one force
   over another that permits the conduct of operations by the former and
   its related land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces at a
   given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing
   force" (JP 1-02). Space superiority may be localized in time and space,
   or it may be broad and enduring. Space superiority provides freedom of
   action in space for friendly forces and, when directed, denies the same
   freedom to the adversary.^[10]

   Space Force Enhancement is defined as the "combat support operations
   and force-multiplying capabilities delivered from space systems to
   improve the effectiveness of military forces as well as support other
   intelligence, civil, and commercial users. This mission area includes:
   intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; integrated tactical
   warning and attack assessment; command, control, and communications;
   positioning, navigation, and timing; and environmental monitoring" (JP
   1-02).^[10]

   Space Force Application is defined as "combat operations in, through,
   and from space to influence the course and outcome of conflict. This
   mission area includes ballistic missile defense and force projection"
   (JP 1-02).^[10]

   Space Control is defined as "operations to ensure freedom of action in
   space for the US and its allies and, when directed, deny an adversary
   freedom of action in space. This mission area includes: operations
   conducted to protect friendly space capabilities from attack,
   interference, or unintentional hazards (defensive space control);
   operations to deny an adversary's use of space capabilities (offensive
   space control); and the requisite current and predictive knowledge of
   the space environment and the operational environment upon which space
   operations depend (space situational awareness)" (JP 1-02).^[10]

   Space Support is defined as "operations to deploy and sustain military
   and intelligence systems in space. This mission area includes:
   launching and deploying space vehicles; maintaining and sustaining
   spacecraft on-orbit, rendezvous and proximity operations; disposing of
   (including de-orbiting and recovering) space capabilities; and
   reconstitution of space forces, if required" (JP 1-02).^[10]

Cyberspace Superiority[edit]

   Cyberspace Superiority is "the operational advantage in, through, and
   from cyberspace to conduct operations at a given time and in a given
   domain without prohibitive interference" (AFDD 3-12, Cyberspace
   Operations).^[10]

   Cyberspace Force Application is combat operations in, through, and from
   cyberspace to achieve military objectives and influence the course and
   outcome of conflict by taking decisive actions against approved
   targets. It will incorporate computer network attack (CNA), computer
   network exploitation (CNE), and may involve aspects of influence
   operations. It is highly dependent on ISR, fused all-source
   intelligence, sophisticated attribution activities, situational
   awareness, and responsive C2.^[10]

   This is the passive, active, and dynamic employment of capabilities to
   respond to imminent or on-going actions against Air Force or Air
   Force-protected networks, the Air Force's portion of the Global
   Information Grid, or expeditionary communications assigned to the Air
   Force. Cyberspace defense incorporates CNE, computer network defense
   (CND), and CNA techniques and may be a contributor to influence
   operations. It is highly dependent upon ISR, fused all-source
   intelligence, automated indications and warning, sophisticated
   attribution/characterization, situational awareness, assessment, and
   responsive C2.^[10]

   Cyberspace Support is foundational, continuous, or responsive
   operations ensuring information integrity and availability in, through,
   and from Air Force-controlled infrastructure and its interconnected
   analog and digital portion of the battle space. Inherent in this
   mission is the ability to establish, extend, secure, protect, and
   defend in order to sustain assigned networks and missions. This
   includes protection measures against supply chain components plus
   critical C2 networks/communications links and nuclear C2 networks. The
   cyberspace support mission incorporates CNE and CND techniques. It
   incorporates all elements of Air Force Network Operations, information
   transport, enterprise management, and information assurance, and is
   dependent on ISR and all-source intelligence.^[10]

Command and Control[edit]

   Command and control is "the exercise of authority and direction by a
   properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the
   accomplishment of the mission. Command and control functions are
   performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
   communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in
   planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and
   operations in the accomplishment of the mission" (JP 1-02). This core
   function includes all of the C2-related capabilities and activities
   associated with air, space, cyberspace, nuclear, and agile combat
   support operations to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical
   objectives.^[10]

   At the Strategic Level Command and Control, the US determines national
   or multinational security objectives and guidance, and develops and
   uses national resources to accomplish these objectives. These national
   objectives in turn provide the direction for developing overall
   military objectives, which are used to develop the objectives and
   strategy for each theater.^[10]

   At the Operational Level Command and Control, campaigns and major
   operations are planned, conducted, sustained, and assessed to
   accomplish strategic goals within theaters or areas of operations.
   These activities imply a broader dimension of time or space than do
   tactics; they provide the means by which tactical successes are
   exploited to achieve strategic and operational objectives.^[10]

   Tactical Level Command and Control is where individual battles and
   engagements are fought. The tactical level of war deals with how forces
   are employed, and the specifics of how engagements are conducted and
   targets attacked. The goal of tactical level C2 is to achieve
   commander's intent and desired effects by gaining and keeping offensive
   initiative.^[10]

Global Integrated ISR[edit]

   Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)
   is the synchronization and integration of the planning and operation of
   sensors, assets, and processing, exploitation, dissemination systems
   across the globe to conduct current and future operations.^[10]

   Planning and Directing is "the determination of intelligence
   requirements, development of appropriate intelligence architecture,
   preparation of a collection plan, and issuance of orders and requests
   to information collection agencies" (JP 2-01, Joint and National
   Intelligence Support to Military Operations). These activities enable
   the synchronization and integration of collection, processing,
   exploitation, analysis, and dissemination activities/resources to meet
   information requirements of national and military decision makers.^[10]

   Collection is "the acquisition of information and the provision of this
   information to processing elements" (JP 2-01). It provides the ability
   to obtain required information to satisfy intelligence needs (via use
   of sources and methods in all domains). Collection activities span the
   Range of Military Operations (ROMO).^[10]

   Processing and exploitation is "the conversion of collected information
   into forms suitable to the production of intelligence" (JP 2-01). It
   provides the ability, across the ROMO, to transform, extract, and make
   available collected information suitable for further analysis or
   action.^[10]

   Analysis and production is "the conversion of processed information
   into intelligence through the integration, evaluation, analysis, and
   interpretation of all source data and the preparation of intelligence
   products in support of known or anticipated user requirements" (JP
   2-01). It provides the ability to integrate, evaluate, and interpret
   information from available sources to create a finished intelligence
   product for presentation or dissemination to enable increased
   situational awareness.^[10]

   Dissemination and Integration is "the delivery of intelligence to users
   in a suitable form and the application of the intelligence to
   appropriate missions, tasks, and functions" (JP 2-01). It provides the
   ability to present information and intelligence products across the
   ROMO enabling understanding of the operational environment to military
   and national decision makers.^[10]

Global Precision Attack[edit]

   Combat Controllers participating in Operation Enduring Freedom provide
   air traffic control to a C-130 taking off from a remote airfield.

   Global Precision Attack is the ability to hold at risk or strike
   rapidly and persistently, with a wide range of munitions, any target
   and to create swift, decisive, and precise effects across multiple
   domains.^[10]

   Strategic Attack is defined as "offensive action specifically selected
   to achieve national strategic objectives. These attacks seek to weaken
   the adversary's ability or will to engage in conflict, and may achieve
   strategic objectives without necessarily having to achieve operational
   objectives as a precondition" (AFDD 3–70, Strategic Attack).^[10]

   Air Interdiction is defined as "air operations conducted to divert,
   disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy's military potential before it can
   be brought to bear effectively against friendly forces, or to otherwise
   achieve JFC objectives. Air lnterdiction is conducted at such distance
   from friendly forces that detailed integration of each air mission with
   the fire and movement of friendly forces is not required" (AFDD 3-03,
   Counterland Operations).^[10]
   A Pararescueman from the 66th Expeditionary Rescue Squadron provides
   medical attention to a wounded Afghan

   Close Air Support is defined as "air action by fixed- and rotary-winged
   aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to
   friendly forces and which require detailed integration of each air
   mission with the fire and movement of those forces" (JP 1-02). This can
   be as a pre-planned event or on demand from an alert posture (ground or
   airborne). It can be conducted across the ROMO.^[10] Today the USAF
   believes that it accomplishes the CAS mission "better than anyone"
   actually does.^[11]

Special Operations[edit]

   Special Operations are "operations conducted in hostile, denied, or
   politically sensitive environments to achieve military, diplomatic,
   informational, and/or economic objectives employing military
   capabilities for which there is no broad conventional force
   requirement. These operations may require covert, clandestine, or
   low-visibility capabilities. Special operations are applicable across
   the ROMO. They can be conducted independently or in conjunction with
   operations of conventional forces or other government agencies and may
   include operations through, with, or by indigenous or surrogate forces.
   Special operations differ from conventional operations in degree of
   physical and political risk, operational techniques, mode of
   employment, independence from friendly support, and dependence on
   detailed operational intelligence and indigenous assets" (JP
   1-02).^[10]

   Agile Combat Support is the capability to effectively create, prepare,
   deploy, employ, sustain, and protect Air Force Special Operations
   Command (AFSOC) Airmen, assets, and capabilities throughout the ROMO at
   a chosen initiative, speed, and tempo.^[10]

   Aviation Foreign Internal Defense operations directly execute US
   security and foreign policy as lead airpower elements that shape the
   battlefield and conduct stability operations to enable global reach and
   strike. This is accomplished by applying the mission set (assess,
   train, advise, and assist foreign aviation forces) across a continuum
   of operating venues described as indirect assistance, direct assistance
   (not including combat) and combat operations.^[10]

   Battlefield Air Operations is a unique set of combat proven
   capabilities (combat control, pararescue, combat weather, and tactical
   air control party) provided by regular and reserve component special
   operations forces (SOF) Battlefield Airmen who integrate, synchronize,
   and control manned and unmanned capabilities to achieve tactical,
   operational, and strategic objectives.^[10]

   Command and Control is the exercise of the commander's authority and
   direction over assigned and attached forces by trained, organized, and
   equipped C2 elements. Operational C2 elements consist of personnel and
   equipment with specialized capability to plan, direct, coordinate, and
   control forces in the conduct of joint/combined special
   operations.^[10]

   Information Operations is the integrated employment of the capabilities
   of influence operations, electronic warfare operations, and network
   warfare operations, in concert with specified integrated control
   enablers, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human
   and automated decision making while protecting one's own.^[10]

   Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance is the synchronization
   and integration of platforms and sensors with the planning and
   direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis, and
   production and dissemination processes. These activities provide
   actionable intelligence, weather, environmental awareness, and
   prediction across all SOF command echelons.^[10]

   Military Information Support Operations are planned operations to
   convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to
   influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately
   the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and
   individuals. The purpose of military information support operations is
   to induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the
   originator's objectives.^[10]

   Precision Strike provides CCDRs with an integrated capability to find,
   fix, track, target, engage, and assess targets using a single weapons
   system or a combination of systems. This includes close air support,
   air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions.^[10]

   Specialized Air Mobility is the conduct of rapid, global infiltration,
   exfiltration, and resupply of personnel, equipment, and materiel using
   specialized systems and tactics. These missions may be clandestine, low
   visibility, or overt and through hostile, denied, or politically
   sensitive airspace.^[10]

   Specialized Refueling is the conduct of rapid, global refueling using
   specialized systems and tactics. This includes aerial refueling of
   vertical lift aircraft and ground refueling during forward arming and
   refueling point operations. These missions may be clandestine, low
   visibility, or overt and in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive
   environments.^[10]

Rapid Global Mobility[edit]

   An F-16 in OpFor colors soars over the Alaska Range in 2010

   Rapid Global Mobility is the timely deployment, employment,
   sustainment, augmentation, and redeployment of military forces and
   capabilities across the ROMO. It provides joint military forces the
   capability to move from place to place while retaining the ability to
   fulfill their primary mission. Rapid Global Mobility is essential to
   virtually every military operation, allowing forces to reach foreign or
   domestic destinations quickly, thus seizing the initiative through
   speed and surprise.^[10]

   Airlift is "operations to transport and deliver forces and materiel
   through the air in support of strategic, operational, or tactical
   objectives" (AFDD 3–17, Air Mobility Operations). The rapid and
   flexible options afforded by airlift allow military forces and national
   leaders the ability to respond and operate in a variety of situations
   and time frames. The global reach capability of airlift provides the
   ability to apply US power worldwide by delivering forces to crisis
   locations. It serves as a US presence that demonstrates resolve and
   compassion in humanitarian crisis.^[10]

   Air Refueling is "the refueling of an aircraft in flight by another
   aircraft" (JP 1-02). Air refueling extends presence, increases range,
   and serves as a force multiplier. It allows air assets to more rapidly
   reach any trouble spot around the world with less dependence on forward
   staging bases or overflight/landing clearances. Air refueling
   significantly expands the options available to a commander by
   increasing the range, payload, persistence, and flexibility of receiver
   aircraft.^[10]

   Aeromedical Evacuation is "the movement of patients under medical
   supervision to and between medical treatment facilities by air
   transportation" (JP 1-02). JP 4-02, Health Service Support, further
   defines it as "the fixed wing movement of regulated casualties to and
   between medical treatment facilities, using organic and/or contracted
   mobility airframes, with aircrew trained explicitly for this mission."
   Aeromedical evacuation forces can operate as far forward as fixed-wing
   aircraft are able to conduct airland operations.^[10]

Personnel Recovery[edit]

   Personnel Recovery (PR) is defined as "the sum of military, diplomatic,
   and civil efforts to prepare for and execute the recovery and
   reintegration of isolated personnel" (JP 1-02). It is the ability of
   the US government and its international partners to effect the recovery
   of isolated personnel across the ROMO and return those personnel to
   duty. PR also enhances the development of an effective, global capacity
   to protect and recover isolated personnel wherever they are placed at
   risk; deny an adversary‘s ability to exploit a nation through
   propaganda; and develop joint, interagency, and international
   capabilities that contribute to crisis response and regional
   stability.^[10]
   Rescuemen of the USAFP, 58th Rescue Squadron exercise recovering a
   downed pilot

   Combat Search and Rescue is "the tactics, techniques, and procedures
   performed by forces to effect the recovery of isolated personnel during
   combat" (JP 1-02). Combat search and rescue is the primary Air Force
   recovery method utilized to conduct PR taskings.^[10]

   Civil Search and Rescue is "the use of aircraft, surface craft,
   submarines, and specialized rescue teams and equipment to search for
   and rescue distressed persons on land or at sea in a permissive
   environment" (JP 1-02).^[10]

   Disaster Response can be described as the capability to support and
   assist US government agencies and embassies during national and
   international disasters with rapidly deployable and flexible air/ground
   rescue forces.^[10]

   Humanitarian Assistance Operations are "programs conducted to relieve
   or reduce the results of natural or manmade disasters or other endemic
   conditions such as human pain, disease, hunger, or privation that might
   present a serious threat to life or that can result in great damage to
   or loss of property. Humanitarian assistance provided by US forces is
   limited in scope and duration. The assistance provided is designed to
   supplement or complement the efforts of the host nation civil
   authorities or agencies that may have the primary responsibility for
   providing humanitarian assistance" (JP 1-02).^[10]

   Medical evacuation refers to dedicated medical evacuation platforms
   staffed and equipped to provide en route medical care using
   predesignated tactical and logistic aircraft, boats, ships, and other
   watercraft temporarily equipped and staffed with medical attendants for
   en route care. Casualty evacuation involves the unregulated movement of
   casualties aboard ships, land vehicles, or aircraft (JP 4-02, Health
   Service Support).^[10]

Agile Combat Support[edit]

   Agile Combat Support (ACS) is the ability to field, protect, and
   sustain Air Force forces across the ROMO to achieve joint effects.^[10]

   Ready the Total Force includes organizing, training, and equipping
   forces; establishing quality of life and maintaining core security; and
   fielding and planning for the use of operational and support forces to
   meet global mission requirements.^[10]

   Prepare the Battlespace includes assessing, planning, and posturing for
   rapid employment; prepositioning resources and conditioning specific
   theaters and/or contingency locations in a manner to meet closure
   timing; and establishing sustainment levels for potential
   operations.^[10]

   Position the Total Force includes preparing to deploy, deploying,
   receiving, and bedding down tailored and prioritized forces;
   establishing initial operations and support cadres in a joint
   operations area; distributing pre-positioned resources; establishing
   initial reachback connectivity; securing operating locations; and
   preparing for mission operations.^[10]

   Protecting the Total Force key focus areas include personnel, critical
   assets, and information. These areas are the persistent detection and
   understanding of threats in the operational environment and the timely
   dissemination of accurate decisions, warnings and taskings to protect
   against attacks and/or threats.^[10]

   Employ Combat Support Forces includes engaging support forces in
   support of mission operations; initializing, launching, recovering, and
   regenerating operational elements; executing support through
   supporting-supported relationships; and commencing reachback operations
   to strategic levels of support.^[10]

   Sustain the Total Force includes producing assured capacities and
   levels of support; accomplishing the long term mastery of an
   operational environment (peacetime and wartime) requiring persistent
   and effective materiel and personnel support through both local and
   reachback processes.^[10]

   Recover the Total Force includes preparing forces to remain in place,
   redeploy, relocate, and be reconstituted to prescribed levels of
   readiness; restoring operating locations and/or environments to planned
   conditions; protecting the dynamic levels of force structure; and
   ensuring Air Force mission elements can be effectively applied at the
   direction of national leadership.^[10]

Building Partnerships[edit]

   Europe (USAFE)

   Building Partnerships is described as Airmen interacting with
   international airmen and other relevant actors to develop, guide, and
   sustain relationships for mutual benefit and security. Building
   Partnerships is about interacting with others and is therefore an
   inherently inter-personal and cross-cultural undertaking. Through both
   words and deeds, the majority of interaction is devoted to building
   trust-based relationships for mutual benefit. It includes both foreign
   partners as well as domestic partners and emphasizes collaboration with
   foreign governments, militaries and populations as well as US
   government departments, agencies, industry, and NGOs. To better
   facilitate partnering efforts, Airmen should be competent in the
   relevant language, region, and culture.^[10]

   Communicate refers to developing and presenting information to domestic
   audiences to improve understanding. It is also the ability to develop
   and present information to foreign adversary audiences to affect their
   perceptions, will, behavior and capabilities in order to further US
   national security and/or shared global security interests.^[10]

   Shape refers to conducting activities to affect the perceptions, will,
   behavior, and capabilities of partners, military forces, and relevant
   populations to further US national security or shared global security
   interests.^[10]

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States Air Force

   The War Department created the first antecedent of the Air Force in
   1907, which through a succession of changes of organization, titles,
   and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later. In
   World War II, almost 68,000 U.S airmen died helping to win the war;
   only the infantry suffered more enlisted casualties.^[12] In practice,
   the USAAF was virtually independent of the Army during World War II,
   but officials wanted formal independence. The USAF became a separate
   military service on 18 September 1947, with the implementation of the
   National Security Act of 1947.^[13] The Act created the National
   Military Establishment (renamed Department of Defense in 1949), which
   was composed of three subordinate Military Departments, namely the
   Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and a newly created
   Department of the Air Force.^[14] Prior to 1947, the responsibility for
   military aviation was shared between the Army (for land-based
   operations), the Navy (for sea-based operations from aircraft carriers
   and amphibious aircraft), and the Marine Corps (for close air support
   of infantry operations). The 1940s proved to be important in other ways
   as well. In 1947, Captain Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in his
   X-1 rocket-powered aircraft, beginning a new era of aeronautics in
   America.^[15]

   The predecessor organizations in the Army of today's Air Force are:
     * Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps 1 August 1907 – 18 July 1914
     * Aviation Section, Signal Corps 18 July 1914 – 20 May 1918
     * Division of Military Aeronautics (20 May 1918 to 24 May 1918)
     * U.S. Army Air Service (24 May 1918 to 2 July 1926)
     * U.S. Army Air Corps (2 July 1926 to 20 June 1941) and
     * U.S. Army Air Forces (20 June 1941 to 18 September 1947)

Recent history[edit]

   Since 2005, the USAF has placed a strong focus on the improvement of
   Basic Military Training (BMT). While the intense training has become
   longer it also has shifted to include a deployment phase. This
   deployment phase, now called the BEAST, places the trainees in a
   surreal environment that they may experience once they deploy. While
   the trainees do tackle the massive obstacle courses along with the
   BEAST, the other portions include defending and protecting their base
   of operations, forming a structure of leadership, directing search and
   recovery, and basic self aid buddy care. During this event, the
   Military Training Instructors (MTI) act as mentors and enemy forces in
   a deployment exercise.^[citation needed]

   In 2007, the USAF undertook a reduction-in-force. Because of budget
   constraints, the USAF planned to reduce the service's size from 360,000
   active duty personnel to 316,000.^[16] The size of the active-duty
   force in 2007 was roughly 64% of that of the USAF at the end of the
   Gulf War in 1991.^[17] However, the reduction was ended at
   approximately 330,000 personnel in 2008 to meet mission
   requirements.^[16] These same constraints have seen a sharp reduction
   in flight hours for crew training since 2005^[18] and the Deputy Chief
   of Staff for Manpower and Personnel directing Airmen's Time
   Assessments.^[19]

   On 5 June 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, accepted the
   resignations of both the Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, and
   the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, Gen. T. Michael
   Moseley. Gates in effect fired both men for "systemic issues associated
   with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance." This
   followed an investigation into two embarrassing incidents involving
   mishandling of nuclear weapons: specifically 2007 United States Air
   Force nuclear weapons incident and an accidental shipment of nuclear
   weapons components to Taiwan. The resignations were also the
   culmination of disputes between the Air Force leadership and
   Gates.^[20] To put more emphasis on nuclear assets, the USAF
   established the nuclear-focused Air Force Global Strike Command on 24
   October 2008.^[21]

   On 26 June 2009, the USAF released a force structure plan that cuts
   fighter aircraft and shifts resources to better support nuclear,
   irregular and information warfare.^[22] On 23 July 2009, The USAF
   released their Unmanned Aerial System Flight Plan, detailing UAV plans
   through 2047.^[23] One third of the planes that the USAF plans to buy
   in the future are to be unmanned.^[24]

   During the early 2000s, the USAF fumbled several high profile aircraft
   procurement projects, such as the failure to make the case for the
   Next-Generation Bomber, the failure to control costs on the Lockheed
   Martin F-22 Raptor and the missteps on the KC-X program. Winslow
   Wheeler has written that this pattern represents "failures of intellect
   and – much more importantly – ethics."^[25] As a result the USAF fleet
   is setting new records for average aircraft age and needs to replace
   its fleets of fighters, bombers, airborne tankers, and airborne warning
   aircraft, in an age of restrictive defense budgets.^[26] Finally in the
   midst of scandal and failure in maintaining its nuclear arsenal, the
   civilian and military leaders of the air force were replaced in
   2008.^[27]

   In 2011, the Air Force disallowed the wear of Friday Name Tags
   ^[clarification needed] per the new dress and appearance
   standards.^[28] This has been a tradition regarding call signs that
   dates to WWI.^[29]

   The budget sequestration of 2013 is claimed to have austere budget
   shortfalls in store for the armed forces, including the Air Force.
   Specific concerns include a compounded inability for the Air Force to
   replace its aging fleet, and an overall reduction of strength and
   readiness.^[30] The USAF attempted to make these adjustments by cutting
   guard and reserve fleets, but Congress reversed this and the majority
   of the lost manpower will come from the active forces.^[31] However
   Congress did allow for $208 million of reprogramming from fleet
   modernization to enable some portion of the third of the grounded fleet
   to resume operations.^[32]

Conflicts[edit]

   The SR-71 Blackbird was a Cold War reconnaissance plane.
   The F-117 Nighthawk was a stealth attack aircraft (retired from service
   on 22 April 2008).

   The United States has been involved in many wars, conflicts and
   operations using military air operations. Air combat operations before,
   and since the official conception of the USAF include:
     * World War I^[33] as Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps and United
       States Army Air Service
     * World War II^[33] as United States Army Air Forces
     * Cold War
     * Korean War
     * Vietnam War
     * Operation Eagle Claw (1980 Iranian hostage rescue)
     * Operation Urgent Fury (1983 US invasion of Grenada)
     * Operation El Dorado Canyon (1986 US Bombing of Libya)
     * Operation Just Cause (1989–1990 US invasion of Panama)
     * Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm (1990–1991 Persian Gulf
       War)
     * Operation Southern Watch (1992–2003 Iraq no-fly zone)
     * Operation Deliberate Force (1995 NATO bombing in Bosnia and
       Herzegovina)
     * Operation Northern Watch (1997–2003 Iraq no-fly zone)
     * Operation Desert Fox (1998 bombing of Iraq)
     * Operation Allied Force (1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia)
     * Operation Enduring Freedom (2001–present Afghanistan War)
     * Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn (2003–2011 Iraq War)
     * Operation Odyssey Dawn (2011 Libyan no-fly zone)

   In addition since the USAF dwarfs all allied air forces, it often
   provides support for allied forces in conflicts to which the United
   States is otherwise not involved, for example the 2013 French campaign
   in Mali.^[34]

Humanitarian operations[edit]

   The USAF has also taken part in numerous humanitarian operations. Some
   of the more major ones include the following:^[35]
     * Berlin Airlift (Operation Vittles), 1948–1949
     * Operation Safe Haven, 1956–1957
     * Operations Babylift, New Life, Frequent Wind, and New Arrivals,
       1975
     * Operation Provide Comfort, 1991
     * Operation Sea Angel, 1991
     * Operation Provide Hope, 1992–1993
     * Operation Provide Promise, 1992-1996
     * Operation Unified Assistance, December 2004 – April 2005
     * Operation Unified Response, 14 January 2010–present
     * Operation Tomodachi, 12 March 2011 – 1 May 2011

Budget squeeze[edit]

   Due to the Budget sequestration in 2013, the USAF was forced to ground
   many of its squadrons. Air Combat Commander Hostage has indicated that
   the USAF must reduce its F-15 and F-16 fleets and eliminate platforms
   like the A-10 in order to focus on a fifth-generation jet fighter
   future.^[36] Air Force pilots have responded by switching to commercial
   airlines where they can find flight hours on more modern aircraft.^[37]

Organization[edit]

   Main articles: Structure of the United States Air Force and Department
   of the Air Force structure

Administrative organization[edit]

   The Department of the Air Force is one of three military departments
   within the Department of Defense, and is managed by the civilian
   Secretary of the Air Force, under the authority, direction, and control
   of the Secretary of Defense. The senior officials in the Office of the
   Secretary are the Under Secretary of the Air Force, four Assistant
   Secretaries of the Air Force and the General Counsel, all of whom are
   appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
   The senior uniformed leadership in the Air Staff is made up of the
   Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air
   Force.

   The directly subordinate commands and units are named Field Operating
   Agency (FOA), Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), and the currently unused
   Separate Operating Agency.

   The Major Command (MAJCOM) is the superior hierarchical level of
   command. Including the Air Force Reserve Command, as of 30 September
   2006, USAF has ten major commands. The Numbered Air Force (NAF) is a
   level of command directly under the MAJCOM, followed by Operational
   Command (now unused), Air Division (also now unused), Wing, Group,
   Squadron, and Flight.

   are the following:^[38]
     * Active duty forces
          + 57 flying wings, eight space wings, and 55 non-flying wings

     * Air National Guard
          + 87 flying wings
               o 101 flying squadrons, four space squadrons

   The USAF, including its Air Reserve Component (e.g., Air Force Reserve
   + Air National Guard), possesses a total of 302 flying squadrons.^[39]

Operational organization[edit]

   Main article: List of active United States Air Force aircraft squadrons

   The organizational structure as shown above is responsible for the
   peacetime organization, equipping, and training of aerospace units for
   operational missions. When required to support operational missions,
   the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) directs the Secretary of the Air
   Force (SECAF) to execute a Change in Operational Control (CHOP) of
   these units from their administrative alignment to the operational
   command of a Regional Combatant Commander (CCDR). In the case of AFSPC,
   AFSOC, PACAF, and USAFE units, forces are normally employed in-place
   under their existing CCDR. Likewise, AMC forces operating in support
   roles retain their componency to USTRANSCOM unless chopped to a
   Regional CCDR.

Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force[edit]

   "Chopped" units are referred to as forces. The top-level structure of
   these forces is the Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The
   AETF is the Air Force presentation of forces to a CCDR for the
   employment of Air Power. Each CCDR is supported by a standing Component
   Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) to provide planning and execution of
   aerospace forces in support of CCDR requirements. Each C-NAF consists
   of a Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and AFFOR/A-staff, and an
   Air Operations Center (AOC). As needed to support multiple Joint Force
   Commanders (JFC) in the COCOM's Area of Responsibility (AOR), the C-NAF
   may deploy Air Component Coordinate Elements (ACCE) to liaise with the
   JFC. If the Air Force possesses the preponderance of air forces in a
   JFC's area of operations, the COMAFFOR will also serve as the Joint
   Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC).

Commander, Air Force Forces[edit]

   The Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is the senior USAF officer
   responsible for the employment of air power in support of JFC
   objectives. The COMAFFOR has a special staff and an A-Staff to ensure
   assigned or attached forces are properly organized, equipped, and
   trained to support the operational mission.

Air Operations Center[edit]

   The Air Operations Center (AOC) is the JFACC's Command and Control (C2)
   center. Several AOCs have been established throughout the Air Force
   world-wide. These centers are responsible for planning and executing
   air power missions in support of JFC objectives.

Air Expeditionary Wings/Groups/Squadrons[edit]

   The AETF generates air power to support COCOM objectives from Air
   Expeditionary Wings (AEW) or Air Expeditionary Groups (AEG). These
   units are responsible for receiving combat forces from Air Force
   MAJCOMs, preparing these forces for operational missions, launching and
   recovering these forces, and eventually returning forces to the
   MAJCOMs. Theater Air Control Systems control employment of forces
   during these missions.

Personnel[edit]

   The classification of any USAF job is the Air Force Specialty Code
   (AFSC). They range from flight combat operations such as a gunner, to
   working in a dining facility to ensure that members are properly fed.
   There are many different jobs in fields such as computer specialties,
   mechanic specialties, enlisted aircrew, communication systems,
   cyberspace operations, avionics technicians, medical specialties, civil
   engineering, public affairs, hospitality, law, drug counseling, mail
   operations, security forces, and search and rescue specialties.^[40]

   Perhaps the most dangerous USAF jobs are Explosive Ordnance Disposal
   (EOD), Combat rescue officer, Pararescue, Security Forces, Combat
   Control, Combat Weather, Tactical Air Control Party, and AFOSI agents,
   who deploy with infantry and special operations units who disarm bombs,
   rescue downed or isolated personnel, call in air strikes and set up
   landing zones in forward locations. Most of these are enlisted
   positions. Other jobs have seen increasing combat, including engineers,
   vehicle operators, and OSI.^[citation needed]

   Nearly all enlisted jobs are "entry level", meaning that the USAF
   provides all training. Some enlistees are able to choose a particular
   job, or at least a field before actually joining, while others are
   assigned an AFSC at Basic Military Training (BMT). After BMT, new
   airmen attend a technical training school where they learn their
   particular AFSC. Second Air Force, a part of Air Education and Training
   Command, is responsible for nearly all technical training.^[citation
   needed]

   Training programs vary in length; for example, 3M0X1 (Services) has 31
   days of tech school training, while 3E8X1 (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)
   is one year of training with a preliminary school and a main school
   consisting of over 10 separate divisions, sometimes taking students
   close to two years to complete.^[citation needed]

   USAF rank is divided between enlisted airmen, non-commissioned
   officers, and commissioned officers, and ranges from the enlisted
   Airman Basic (E-1) to the commissioned rank of General (O-10). Enlisted
   promotions are granted based on a combination of test scores, years of
   experience, and selection board approval while officer promotions are
   based on time-in-grade and a promotion board. Promotions among enlisted
   personnel and non-commissioned officers are generally designated by
   increasing numbers of insignia chevrons. Commissioned officer rank is
   designated by bars, oak leaves, a silver eagle, and anywhere from one
   to four stars (one to five stars in war-time).^[citation needed]

Commissioned officers[edit]

   Main article: United States Air Force officer rank insignia

   The commissioned officer ranks of the USAF are divided into three
   categories: company grade, field grade, and general officers. Company
   grade officers are those officers in pay grades O-1 to O-3, while field
   grade officers are those in pay grades O-4 to O-6, and general officers
   are those in pay grades of O-7 and above.^[citation needed]

   Air Force officer promotions are governed by the Defense Officer
   Personnel Management Act of 1980. DOPMA also establishes limits on the
   number of officers that can serve at any given time in the Air Force.
   Currently, promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant is
   virtually guaranteed after two years of satisfactory service. The
   promotion from first lieutenant to captain is competitive after
   successfully completing another two years of service, with a selection
   rate varying between 99% and 100%. Promotion to major through major
   general is through a board process, while promotions to lieutenant
   general and general are contingent upon nomination to specific general
   officer positions and subject to U.S. Senate approval.

   During the board process an officer's record is reviewed by a selection
   board at the Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base in
   San Antonio, Texas. At the eight-year mark captains will take part in a
   selection board to major. If not selected, they will meet a follow-on
   board to determine if they will be allowed to remain in the Air Force.
   Promotion from major to lieutenant colonel is similar and occurs
   approximately between the eleven- and fifteen-year mark, where a
   certain percentage of majors will be selected below zone (i.e.,
   "early"), in zone (i.e., "on time") or above zone (i.e., "late") for
   promotion to Lieutenant Colonel. This process will repeat at the
   16–21-year mark for promotion to Colonel.^[citation needed]

   The Air Force has the largest ratio of general officers to total
   strength of all of the U.S. armed forces and this ratio has continued
   to increase even as the force has shrunk from its Cold War highs.^[41]

Warrant officers[edit]

   Although provision is made in Title 10 of the United States Code for
   the Secretary of the Air Force to appoint warrant officers, the Air
   Force does not currently use warrant officer grades, and is the only
   one of the U.S. Armed Services not to do so. The Air Force inherited
   warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their
   place in the Air Force structure was never made clear.^[citation
   needed] When the Congress authorized the creation of two new senior
   enlisted ranks in 1958, Air Force officials privately concluded that
   these two new "super grades" could fill all Air Force needs then
   performed at the warrant officer level, although this was not publicly
   acknowledged until years later.^[citation needed] The Air Force stopped
   appointing warrant officers in 1959,^[42] the same year the first
   promotions were made to the new top enlisted grade, Chief Master
   Sergeant. Most of the existing Air Force warrant officers entered the
   commissioned officer ranks during the 1960s, but tiny numbers continued
   to exist for the next 21 years.^[citation needed]

   The last active duty Air Force warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long,
   retired in 1980 and the last Air Force Reserve warrant officer, CWO4
   Bob Barrow, retired in 1992.^[43] Upon his retirement, he was
   honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to
   hold this grade.^[42] Barrow died in April 2008.^[44] Since Barrow's
   retirement, the Air Force warrant officer ranks, while still authorized
   by law, are not used.

Enlisted airmen[edit]

   Main article: United States Air Force enlisted rank insignia

   Enlisted members of the USAF have pay grades from E-1 (entry level) to
   E-9 (senior enlisted). While all USAF military personnel are referred
   to as Airmen, the term also refers to the pay grades of E-1 through
   E-4, which are below the level of non-commissioned officers (NCOs).
   Above the pay grade of E-4 (i.e., pay grades E-5 through E-9) all ranks
   fall into the category of NCO and are further subdivided into "NCOs"
   (pay grades E-5 and E-6) and "Senior NCOs" (pay grades E-7 through
   E-9); the term "Junior NCO" is sometimes used to refer to staff
   sergeants and technical sergeants (pay grades E-5 and E-6).^[45]

   The USAF is the only branch of the U.S. military where NCO status is
   achieved when an airman reaches the pay grade of E-5. In all other
   branches, NCO status is generally achieved at the pay grade of E-4
   (e.g., a Corporal in the Army^[46] and Marine Corps, Petty Officer
   Third Class in the Navy and Coast Guard). The Air Force mirrored the
   Army from 1976 to 1991 with an E-4 being either a Senior Airman wearing
   three stripes without a star or a Sergeant (referred to as "Buck
   Sergeant"), which was noted by the presence of the central star and
   considered an NCO. Despite not being an NCO, a Senior Airman who has
   completed Airman Leadership School can be a supervisor.^[citation

Uniforms[edit]

   Main article: Uniforms of the United States Air Force

   The first USAF dress uniform, in 1947, was dubbed and patented
   "Uxbridge Blue" after "Uxbridge 1683 Blue", developed at the former
   Bachman-Uxbridge Worsted Company.^[47] The current Service Dress
   Uniform, which was adopted in 1993 and standardized in 1995, consists
   of a three-button, pocketless coat, similar to that of a men's "sport
   jacket" (with silver "U.S." pins on the lapels, with a silver ring
   surrounding on those of enlisted members), matching trousers, and
   either a service cap or flight cap, all in Shade 1620, "Air Force Blue"
   (a darker purplish-blue). This is worn with a light blue shirt (Shade
   1550) and Shade 1620 herringbone patterned necktie. Enlisted members
   wear sleeve insignia on both the jacket and shirt, while officers wear
   metal rank insignia pinned onto the coat, and Air Force Blue slide-on
   epaulet loops on the shirt. USAF personnel assigned to Base Honor Guard
   duties wear, for certain occasions, a modified version of the standard
   service dress uniform, but with silver trim on the sleeves and
   trousers, with the addition of a ceremonial belt (if necessary), wheel
   cap with silver trim and Hap Arnold Device, and a silver aiguillette
   placed on the left shoulder seam and all devices and accoutrement.

   The Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) became the sole authorized utility
   uniform (except the flight suit for air, missile and space crews) of
   the USAF on 1 November 2011. The ABU replaced the Battle Dress Uniform
   (BDU) previously worn by all U.S. military forces.

Awards and badges[edit]

   Main articles: Awards and decorations of the United States Air Force
   and Badges of the United States Air Force

   In addition to basic uniform clothing, various badges are used by the
   USAF to indicate a job assignment or qualification-level for a given
   assignment. Badges can also be used as merit-based or service-based
   awards. Over time, various badges have been discontinued and are no
   longer distributed. Authorized badges include the Shields of USAF Fire
   Protection, and Security Forces, and the Missile Badge (or "pocket
   rocket"), which is earned after working in a missile system maintenance
   or operations capacity for at least one year.

Training[edit]

   Main article: United States Air Force Basic Military Training

   All non-prior service enlisted Airmen attend Basic Military Training
   (BMT) at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas for 8 1/2 weeks.
   The Air Force accepts the basic-training programs of other U.S.
   military branches in lieu of BMT for airmen who enlist having completed
   prior service in the U.S. Army, Navy, or Marine Corps.

   Officers may be commissioned upon graduation from the United States Air
   Force Academy, upon graduation from another college or university
   through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program,
   or through the Air Force Officer Training School (OTS). OTS, which is
   based at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, in turn
   encompasses two separate commissioning programs: Basic Officer Training
   (BOT), which is for line-officer candidates of the active-duty Air
   Force and the U.S. Air Force Reserve; and the Academy of Military
   Science (AMS), which is for line-officer candidates of the Air National
   Guard. (The term "line officer" derives from the concept of the line of
   battle and refers to an officer whose role falls somewhere within the
   "Line of the Air", meaning combat or combat-support operations within
   the scope of legitimate combatants as defined by the Geneva
   Conventions.)

   The Air Force also provides Commissioned Officer Training (COT) for
   officers of all three components who are direct-commissioned to
   non-line positions due to their credentials in medicine, law, religion,
   biological sciences, or healthcare administration. Originally viewed as
   a "knife and fork school" that covered little beyond basic wear of the
   uniform, COT in recent years has been fully integrated into the OTS
   program and today encompasses extensive coursework as well as field
   exercises in leadership, confidence, fitness, and deployed-environment
   operations.

Air Force Fitness Test[edit]

   Main article: United States Air Force Fitness Assessment

   The US Air Force Fitness Test (AFFT) is designed to test the abdominal
   circumference, muscular strength/endurance and cardiovascular
   respiratory fitness of airmen in the USAF. As part of the Fit to Fight
   program, the USAF adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment;
   the new fitness program was put into effect on 1 June 2010. The annual
   ergo-cycle test which the USAF had used for several years had been
   replaced in 2004. In the AFFT, Airmen are given a score based on
   performance consisting of four components: waist circumference, the
   sit-up, the push-up, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run. Airmen can
   potentially earn a score of 100, with the run counting as 60%, waist
   circumference as 20%, and both strength test counting as 10% each. A
   passing score is 75 points. Effective 1 July 2010, the AFFT is
   administered by the base Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC), and is required
   twice a year. Personnel may test once a year if he or she earns a score
   above a 90%. Additionally, only meeting the minimum standards on each
   one of these test will not get you a passing score of 75%, and failing
   any one component will result in a failure for the entire test.

Aircraft inventory[edit]

   Main article: List of active United States military aircraft

   The U.S. Air Force has over 5,638 aircraft in service as of September
   2012.^[48] Until 1962, the Army and Air Force maintained one system of
   aircraft naming, while the U.S. Navy maintained a separate system. In
   1962, these were unified into a single system heavily reflecting the
   Army/Air Force method. For more complete information on the workings of
   this system, refer to United States Department of Defense aerospace
   vehicle designation. The various aircraft of the Air Force include:

A – Ground attack[edit]

   A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack aircraft

   The ground-attack aircraft of the USAF are designed to attack targets
   on the ground and are often deployed as close air support for, and in
   proximity to, U.S. ground forces. The proximity to friendly forces
   require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible
   with bomber aircraft listed below. They are typically deployed as close
   air support to ground forces, their role is tactical rather than
   strategic, operating at the front of the battle rather than against
   targets deeper in the enemy's rear.
     * A-10A/C/OA-10A Thunderbolt IIThe USAF operated 345 A-10 and OA-10
       aircraft (191 in active duty, 106 in ANG, and 48 in AFRC, all
       variants) as 2013
     * AC-130H/U Spectre/Spooky II

B – Strategic bombers[edit]

   B-2 Spirit stealth strategic bomber
   B-1B Lancer supersonic strategic bomber

   In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers,
   and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones
   that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little
   ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the
   F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for
   aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the
   question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable
   of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter
   bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and
   around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction
   is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly
   increases the potential radius of combat operations. The US, Russia,
   and the People's Republic of China operate strategic bombers.

   The B-52 Stratofortress airframe is over 60 years old, and are
   scheduled to remain in service for another 30 years, which would keep
   the airframe in service for nearly 90 years, an unprecedented length of
   service for any aircraft. Plans for successors to the current strategic
   bomber force remain only paper projects, and political and funding
   pressures suggest that they are likely to remain paper-bound for the
   foreseeable future.
     * B-52H Stratofortress (78 in service as 2013)
     * B-1B Lancer (64 in service as 2013)
     * B-2A Spirit (20 in service as 2013)

C – Cargo transport[edit]

   C-17 Globemaster III, the USAF's newest and most versatile transport
   plane
   C-5 Galaxy heavy airlift
   CV-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft

   The Air Force can provide rapid global mobility, which lies at the
   heart of U.S. strategy in this environment—without the capability to
   project forces, there is no conventional deterrent. As U.S. forces
   stationed overseas continue to decline, global interests remain, making
   the unique mobility capabilities of the USAF even more in demand. Air
   mobility is a national asset of growing importance for responding to
   emergencies and protecting American interests around the globe.

   Cargo and transport aircraft are typically used to deliver troops,
   weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any
   area of military operations around the world, usually outside of the
   commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. The workhorses of
   the USAF Air Mobility Command are the C-130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster
   III, and C-5 Galaxy. These aircraft are largely defined in terms of
   their range capability as strategic airlift (C-5), strategic/tactical
   (C-17), and tactical (C-130) airlift to reflect the needs of the land
   forces they most often support. The CV-22 is used by the Air Force for
   the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It conducts long-range,
   special operations missions, and is equipped with extra fuel tanks and
   terrain-following radar.
     * C-5A/B/C/M Galaxy

     * C-130E/H Hercules
     * C-130J Super Hercules
     * C-145A Skytruck
     * CV-22B Osprey

E – Special electronic missions[edit]

   E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control system

   The purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent an advantage
   in the EMS and ensure friendly, unimpeded access to the EM spectrum
   portion of the information environment. Electronic warfare aircraft are
   used to keep airspaces friendly, and send critical information to
   anyone who needs it. They are often called "The Eye in the Sky."

   F-15E Strike Eagle strike fighter

   The fighter aircraft of the USAF are small, fast, and maneuverable
   military aircraft primarily used for air-to-air combat. Many of these
   fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are
   dual-roled as fighter-bombers (e.g., the F-16 Fighting Falcon); the
   term "fighter" is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated
   ground-attack aircraft. Other missions include interception of bombers
   and other fighters, reconnaissance, and patrol. The USAF has 2,025
   fighters in service as of September 2012.^[48]
     * F-15C and D Eagle
     * F-15E Strike Eagle
     * F-16C and D Fighting Falcon Block 25/30/32/40/42/50/52/52+
     * F-22A Raptor
     * F-35A Lightning II (in testing, not yet in operational service.)

H – Search and rescue[edit]

   These aircraft are used for search and rescue and combat search and
   rescue on land or sea.
     * HC-130P/N Hercules
     * HH-60G/MH-60G Pave Hawk

K – Tanker[edit]

   KC-10 Extender tri-jet air-to-air tanker

   The USAF's aerial refueling aircraft are derivatives of civilian jets.
   The USAF aircraft are equipped primarily for providing the fuel via a
   tail-mounted refueling boom, and can be equipped with "probe and
   drogue" refueling systems. Air-to-air refueling is extensively used in
   large-scale operations and also used in normal operations; fighters,
   bombers, and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the lesser-known "tanker"
   aircraft. This makes these aircraft an essential part of the Air
   Force's global mobility and the U.S. force projection.
     * KC-10A Extender
     * KC-135E/R/T Stratotanker

M – Multi-mission[edit]

   MC-12W Liberty at Beale AFB

   Specialized multi-mission aircraft provide support for global special
   operations missions. These aircraft conduct infiltration, exfiltration,
   resupply, and refueling for SOF teams from improvised or otherwise
   short runways.
     * MC-130H/P/W/J Combat Talon II/Combat Shadow/Combat Spear/Commando
       II
     * MC-12W Liberty

   Q – Multi-mission Remote Piloted Aircraft

   MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle

   Initial generations of RPAs were primarily surveillance aircraft, but
   some were fitted with weaponry (such as the MQ-1 Predator, which used
   AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles). An armed RPA is known as an
   unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV).
     * MQ-1 Predator
     * MQ-9 Reaper

O – Observation[edit]

   These aircraft are modified to observe (through visual or other means)
   and report tactical information concerning composition and disposition
   of forces.
     * OC-135B Open Skies

R – Reconnaissance[edit]

   Lockheed U-2 spy plane

   The reconnaissance aircraft of the USAF are used for monitoring enemy
   activity, originally carrying no armament.

   Note: Although the U-2 is designated as a 'utility' aircraft, it is
   indeed a reconnaissance platform.
     * RC-26B
     * RC-135S/U/V/W Cobra Ball/Combat Sent/Rivet Joint/Rivet Joint
     * U-2R/S "Dragon Lady"

   Q – Reconnaissance Remote Piloted Aircraft

   RQ-170 Sentinel stealth unmanned aerial vehicle reconnaissance aircraft

   Several unmanned remotely controlled reconnaissance aircraft (RPAs),
   have been developed and deployed. Recently, the RPAs have been seen to
   offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that
   can be used without risk to aircrews.
     * RQ-4A Global Hawk
     * RQ-11 Raven
     * RQ-170 Sentinel

T – Trainer[edit]

   The Air Force's trainer aircraft are used to train pilots, navigators,
   and other aircrew in their duties.
     * T-1A Jayhawk
     * T-6A Texan II
     * (A)T-38A/B/C Talon
     * Diamond T-52A

   G – Trainer Gliders

   Several gliders have been employed by the USAF. Primarily used for
   flying training at the Air Force Academy.
     * TG-10B/C/D
     * TG-15A/TG-15B

U – Utility[edit]

   Utility aircraft are used basically for what they are needed for at the
   time. For example, a Huey may be used to transport personnel around a
   large base or launch site, while it can also be used for evacuation.
   These aircraft are all around use aircraft.
     * U-28A
     * UH-1N Iroquois
     * UV-18A/B Twin Otter

V – VIP staff transport[edit]

   VC-25A (Air Force One)

   These aircraft are used for the transportation of Very Important
   Persons (VIPs). Notable people include the President, Vice president,
   Cabinet secretaries, government officials (e.g., senators and
   representatives), the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other key personnel.
     * VC-9C
     * VC-25A (two used as Air Force One)
     * C-20A/B/C Gulfstream III
     * C-20G/H Gulfstream IV
     * C-21A Learjet
     * C-32A/B (sometimes used as Air Force Two)
     * C-37A/B Gulfstream V
     * C-38A Courier

     * C-47T (6th Special Operations Squadron)

Other[edit]

     * LGM-30G Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

Culture[edit]

   Mark Welsh has called the USAF "a service that prides itself on being
   fueled by innovations, was born of technology and must stay ahead of
   the technological curve to be successful", but Welsh only allows travel
   to scientific conferences by special dispensation.^[50]

   The culture of the United States Air Force is primarily driven by
   pilots and so the pilots of various aircraft types have driven its
   priorities over the years. At first there was a focus on bombers
   (driven originally by the Bomber Mafia), followed by a focus on
   fighters (Fighter Mafia and following).^[51]^[52]^[53]

   In response to the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons
   incident, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates accepted in June 2009 the
   resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief
   of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley. Moseley's
   successor, General Norton A. Schwartz, was the first officer appointed
   to that position who did not have a background as a fighter or bomber
   pilot.^[54] The Washington Post reported in 2010 that General Schwartz
   began to dismantle the rigid class system of the USAF.^[55] In 2014 new
   SoAF Deborah Lee James admitted that there remained a "systemic
   problem" in the USAF's management of the nuclear mission.^[56]

   Daniel L. Magruder, Jr defines USAF culture as a combination of the
   rigorous application of advanced technology, individualism and
   progressive airpower theory.^[57] Major General Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.
   adds that Air Force culture includes an egalitarianism bred from
   officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen
   either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft.^[58]

   Cultural and career issues in the U.S. Air Force have been cited as
   reasons for a shortfall in needed drone operators.^[59] In spite of an
   urgent need for drones to provide round the clock coverage for American
   troops during the Iraq War,^[60] the USAF did not establish a new
   career field for piloting them until the last year of that war and in
   2014 changed its RPA training syllabus again, in the face of large
   aircraft losses in training,^[61] and in response to a GAO report
   critical of handling of drone programs.^[62] Paul Scharre has reported
   that the cultural divide between the USAF and US Army has kept both
   services from adopting each other's drone handing innovations.^[63]

   The "roof stomp" is a cultural tradition practiced by Air Force members
   to welcome a new commanding officer or commemorate another event, such
   as a retirement.

   Recently, controversy has emerged following the dismissal of an airman
   after he refused to swear an oath to God that was part of his
   re-enlistment contract.^[64]

Slogans and creeds[edit]

   The United States Air Force has had numerous recruiting slogans
   including "No One Comes Close" and Uno Ab Alto ("One From On High").
   For many years, the U.S. Air Force used "Aim High" as its recruiting
   slogan; more recently, they have used "Cross into the Blue", "We've
   been waiting for you" and "Do Something Amazing",^[65] "Above
   All",^[66] and the newest one, as of 7 October 2010, considered a call
   and response, "Aim high" followed with the response,
   "Fly-Fight-Win"^[67] Each wing, group, or squadron usually has its own
   slogan(s). Information and logos can usually be found on the wing,
   group, or squadron websites.^[68]

   The Air Force Core Values are: "Integrity first", "Service before
   self", "Excellence in all we do".^[69] The Airman's Creed is a
   statement introduced in early 2007 to summarize the culture of the Air
   Force.

   To help further knowledge of their mission and functions, the Air Force
   has also produced videos, such as "Setting the Conditions for Victory"
   and "How We Fight",^[70] to outline the Air Force role in the war on
   terrorism and how the service succeeds in its domains of air, space,
   and cyberspace. The Above All campaign continues to support the message
   of "air, space and cyberspace" dominance.^[66]
