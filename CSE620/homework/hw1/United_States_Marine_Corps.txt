   The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the United States
   Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection from the
   sea,^[7] using the mobility of the U.S. Navy to rapidly deliver
   combined-arms task forces. The U.S. Marine Corps is one of the four
   branches in the U.S. Department of Defense as well as one of the seven
   uniformed services of the United States. It operates posts on land and
   aboard sea-going amphibious warfare ships around the world. The Marine
   Corps has been a component of the U.S. Department of the Navy since
   1834,^[8]^[9] working closely with naval forces for training,
   transportation, and logistics.^[10]

   Two battalions of Continental Marines were formed on 10 November, 1775
   in Philadelphia as an Infantry force capable of fighting for
   independence both at sea and on shore.^[11] The role of the Corps has
   since grown and evolved, expanding to aerial warfare and earning
   popular titles such as "America's third air force" and "second land
   army".^[12] The Marine Corps has distingushed itself as it has served
   in the majority of American wars, from its inception to the modern era,
   and attained prominence in the 20th century when its theories and
   practices of amphibious warfare proved prescient and ultimately formed
   the cornerstone of the Pacific campaign of World War II.^[13] By the
   mid-20th century, the Marine Corps had become a major theorist and the
   dominant practitioner of amphibious warfare.^[14]^[15]^[16] Its ability
   to rapidly respond on short notice to expeditionary crises gives it a
   strong role in the implementation and execution of American foreign
   policy.^[17]

   The U.S. Marine Corps has around 194,000 active duty members and just
   under 40,000 reserve Marines as of 2010.^[3] It is the smallest of the
   United States Armed Forces in the U.S. Department of
   Defense.^[18]^[19]^[20]

Mission[edit]

   The USMC serves as an expeditionary force-in-readiness. As outlined in
   10 U.S.C. § 5063 and as originally introduced under the National
   Security Act of 1947, it has three primary areas of responsibility:
     * The seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land
       operations to support naval campaigns;
     * The development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by
       amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air
       Force; and
     * Such other duties as the President may direct.

   Province.

   This last clause, while seemingly redundant given the President's
   position as Commander-in-chief, is a codification of the expeditionary
   responsibilities of the Marine Corps. It derives from similar language
   in the Congressional acts "For the Better Organization of the Marine
   Corps" of 1834, and "Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps" of
   1798. In 1951, the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee
   called the clause "one of the most important statutory – and
   traditional – functions of the Marine Corps." It noted that the corps
   has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature,
   including its famous actions in Tripoli, the War of 1812, Chapultepec,
   and numerous counter-insurgency and occupational duties (such as those
   in Central America), World War I, and the Korean War. While these
   actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor
   as amphibious warfare, their common thread is that they are of an
   expeditionary nature, using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely
   intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests.^[21]

   embassy in December 2004.

   In addition to its primary duties, the Marine Corps has missions in
   direct support of the White House and the State Department. The Marine
   Band, dubbed the "President's Own" by Thomas Jefferson, provides music
   for state functions at the White House.^[22] Marines from Ceremonial
   Companies A & B, quartered in Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., guard
   presidential retreats, including Camp David, and the Marines of the
   Executive Flight Detachment of HMX-1 provide helicopter transport to
   the President and Vice President, with the call signs "Marine One" and
   "Marine Two", respectively.^[23] By authority of the 1946 Foreign
   Service Act, the Marine Security Guards of the Marine Embassy Security
   Command provide security for American embassies, legations, and
   consulates at more than 140 posts worldwide.^[24]

Historical mission[edit]

   The Marine Corps was founded to serve as an infantry unit aboard naval
   vessels and was responsible for the security of the ship and its crew
   by conducting offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions
   and defending the ship's officers from mutiny; to the latter end, their
   quarters on ship were often strategically positioned between the
   officers' quarters and the rest of the vessel. Continental Marines
   manned raiding parties, both at sea and ashore. America's first
   amphibious assault landing occurred early in the Revolutionary War on 3
   March 1776 as the Marines gained control of Fort Montague and Fort
   Nassau, a British ammunition depot and naval port in New Providence,
   the Bahamas. The role of the Marine Corps has expanded significantly
   since then; as the importance of its original naval mission declined
   with changing naval warfare doctrine and the professionalization of the
   naval service, the Corps adapted by focusing on formerly secondary
   missions ashore. The Advanced Base Doctrine of the early 20th century
   codified their combat duties ashore, outlining the use of Marines in
   the seizure of bases and other duties on land to support naval
   campaigns.

   Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, Marine detachments served
   aboard Navy cruisers, battleships and carriers. Marine detachments
   (generally one platoon per cruiser, a company for battleships or
   carriers) served their traditional duties as ship's landing force,
   manning the ship's weapons and providing shipboard security. Marine
   detachments were augmented by members of the ship's company for landing
   parties, such as in the First Sumatran Expedition of 1832, and
   continuing in the Caribbean and Mexican campaigns of the early 20th
   centuries. Marines would develop tactics and techniques of amphibious
   assault on defended coastlines in time for use in World War II.^[25]
   During World War II, Marines continued to serve on capital ships. They
   often were assigned to man anti-aircraft batteries. When gun cruisers
   were retired by the 1960s, the remaining Marine detachments were only
   seen on battleships and carriers. Its original mission of providing
   shipboard security finally ended in the 1990s when nuclear weapons were
   withdrawn from active deployment and the battleships were retired.

Capabilities[edit]

   Amphibious Warfare during Operation Talisman Sabre at Shoalwater Bay in
   Australia.

   The Marine Corps fulfills a vital role in national security as an
   amphibious, expeditionary, air-ground combined arms task force, capable
   of forcible entry from the air, land, and sea. It is capable of
   asymmetric warfare with conventional, irregular, and hybrid forces.

   While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a
   force it can rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force to almost
   anywhere in the world within days. The basic structure for all deployed
   units is a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) that integrates a
   ground combat element, an aviation combat element and a logistics
   combat element under a common command element. While the creation of
   joint commands under the Goldwater–Nichols Act has improved
   inter-service coordination between each branch, the Corps' ability to
   permanently maintain integrated multi-element task forces under a
   single command provides a smoother implementation of combined-arms
   warfare principles.^[13]

   The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an
   organizational culture centered around the infantry. Every other Marine
   capability exists to support the infantry. Unlike some Western
   militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories
   proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently. For
   example, Marine aviation has always been focused on close air support
   and has remained largely uninfluenced by air power theories proclaiming
   that strategic bombing can single-handedly win wars.^[25]

   This focus on the infantry is matched with the doctrine that "Every
   Marine a rifleman", a focus of Commandant Alfred M. Gray, Jr.,
   emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine. All Marines,
   regardless of military specialization, receive training as a rifleman;
   and all officers receive additional training as infantry platoon
   commanders.^[26] For example, at Wake Island, when all of the Marine
   aircraft were shot down, pilots continued the fight as ground officers,
   leading supply clerks and cooks in a final defensive effort.^[27] As a
   result, a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior
   Marines, particularly the NCOs (corporals and sergeants), as compared
   with many other military organizations. The Marine Corps emphasizes
   authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the
   other military services. Flexibility of execution is implemented via an
   emphasis on "commander's intent" as a guiding principle for carrying
   out orders; specifying the end state but leaving open the method of
   execution.^[28] The amphibious assault techniques developed for World
   War II evolved, with the addition of air assault and maneuver warfare
   doctrine, into the current "Operational Maneuver from the Sea" doctrine
   of power projection from the seas.^[7] The Marines are credited with
   the development of helicopter insertion doctrine and were the earliest
   in the American military to widely adopt maneuver-warfare principles
   which emphasize low-level initiative and flexible execution. In light
   of recent warfare that has strayed from the Corps' traditional
   missions,^[29] it has renewed an emphasis on amphibious
   capabilities.^[30]

   The Marine Corps relies on the Navy for sealift to provide its rapid
   deployment capabilities. In addition to basing a third of the Fleet
   Marine Force in Japan, Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) are typically
   stationed at sea. This allows the ability to function as first
   responders to international incidents. The United States Army now
   maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment,
   but those units do not match the combined-arms integration of a MAGTF
   and lack the logistics that the Navy provides.^[13] For this reason,
   the Marine Corps is often assigned to non-combat missions such as the
   evacuation of Americans from unstable countries and providing
   humanitarian relief during natural disasters. In larger conflicts,
   Marines act as a stopgap, to get into and hold an area until larger
   units can be mobilized. The Corps performed this role in World War I
   and the Korean War, where Marines were the first significant combat
   units deployed from the United States and held the line until the
   country could mobilize for war.^[31] To aid rapid deployment, the
   Maritime Pre-Positioning System was developed: fleets of container
   ships are positioned throughout the world with enough equipment and
   supplies for a Marine Expeditionary Force to deploy for 30 days.

   The USMC is planning to reduce its logistical requirements and by 2025
   eliminate all liquid fuel use for Marine Expeditionary Forces, except
   for highly efficient vehicles.^[32]

Doctrine[edit]

   Two small manuals published during the 1930s would establish USMC
   doctrine in two areas. The Small Wars Manual laid the framework for
   Marine counter-insurgency operations from Vietnam to Iraq and
   Afghanistan while the Tentative Landing Operations Manual established
   the doctrine for the amphibious operations of World War II.
   "Operational Maneuver from the Sea" is the current doctrine of power
   projection.^[7]

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the United States Marine Corps

Origins[edit]

   rowboats, with two ships in the background
   Continental Marines land at New Providence during the Battle of Nassau,
   the first amphibious landing of the Marine Corps.

   The United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the
   Continental Marines of the American Revolutionary War, formed by
   Captain Samuel Nicholas by a resolution of the Second Continental
   Congress on 10 November 1775, to raise 2 battalions of Marines. That
   date is regarded and celebrated as the date of the Marine Corps'
   birthday. At the end of the American Revolution, both the Continental
   Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded in April 1783. The
   institution itself would not be resurrected until 11 July 1798. At that
   time, in preparation for the Quasi-War with France, Congress created
   the United States Marine Corps.^[33] Marines had been enlisted by the
   War Department as early as August 1797^[34] for service in the
   new-build frigates authorized by the Congressional "Act to provide a
   Naval Armament" of 18 March 1794,^[35] which specified the numbers of
   Marines to be recruited for each frigate.
   The action between Hornet and Penguin, the final engagement between
   British and American forces during the War of 1812, which led to the
   capture and destruction of the British ship by Marine infantrymen.

   The Marines' most famous action of this period occurred during the
   First Barbary War (1801–1805) against the Barbary pirates,^[36] when
   William Eaton and First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon led eight Marines
   and 500 mercenaries in an effort to capture Tripoli. Though they only
   reached Derna, the action at Tripoli has been immortalized in the
   Marines' hymn and the Mameluke Sword carried by Marine officers.^[37]

   During the War of 1812, Marine naval detachments took part in the great
   frigate duels that characterized the war, which were the first and last
   engagements of the conflict. Their most significant contribution was
   holding the center of Gen. Andrew Jackson's defensive line at the
   Battle of New Orleans, the final major battle of the conflict. By the
   end of the war, most notably during the capture of HMS Cyane, Levant
   and Penguin, the final engagements between British and American forces,
   the Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as expert marksmen,
   especially in ship-to-ship actions.^[37]

   After the war, the Marine Corps fell into a depression that ended with
   the appointment of Archibald Henderson as its fifth Commandant in 1820.
   Under his tenure, the Corps took on expeditionary duties in the
   Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, Key West, West Africa, the Falkland
   Islands, and Sumatra. Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting
   President Jackson's attempts to combine and integrate the Marine Corps
   with the Army.^[37] Instead, Congress passed the Act for the Better
   Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834, stipulating that the Corps
   was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service to the
   Navy.^[38] This would be the first of many times that the existence of
   the Corps was challenged.

   Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service in the
   Seminole Wars of 1835, personally leading nearly half of the entire
   Corps (two battalions) to war. A decade later, in the Mexican–American
   War (1846–1848), the Marines made their famed assault on Chapultepec
   Palace in Mexico City, which would be later celebrated by the phrase
   "From The Halls of Montezuma" in Marines' hymn. In the 1850s, the
   Marines would see further service in Panama and Asia, escorting Matthew
   Perry's East India Squadron on its historic trip to the Far East.^[39]

   Civil War-era rifles and one with an NCO sword.

   Washington Navy Yard, 1864

   With their vast service in foreign engagements, the Marine Corps played
   a moderate role in the Civil War (1861–1865); their most prominent task
   was blockade duty. As more and more states seceded from the Union,
   about a third of the Corps' officers left the Union to join the
   Confederacy and form the Confederate States Marine Corps, which
   ultimately played little part in the war. The battalion of recruits
   formed for the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) performed
   poorly, retreating with the rest of the Union forces.^[31] Blockade
   duty included sea-based amphibious operations to secure forward bases.
   In late November 1861, Marines and sailors landed a reconnaissance in
   force from the USS Flag at Tybee Island, Georgia, to occupy the
   Lighthouse and Martello Tower on the northern end of the island. It
   would later be the Army base for bombardment of Fort Pulaski.^[40]

Interim: American Civil War to World War I[edit]

   The remainder of the 19th century was marked by declining strength and
   introspection about the mission of the Marine Corps. The Navy's
   transition from sail to steam put into question the need for Marines on
   naval ships. Meanwhile, Marines served as a convenient resource for
   interventions and landings to protect American lives and interests
   overseas. The Corps was involved in over 28 separate interventions in
   the 30 years from the end of the American Civil War to the end of 19th
   century. They would be called upon to stem political and labor unrest
   within the United States.^[41] Under Commandant Jacob Zeilin's tenure,
   Marine customs and traditions took shape: the Corps adopted the Marine
   Corps emblem on 19 November 1868. It was during this time that "The
   Marines' Hymn" was first heard. Around 1883, the Marines adopted their
   current motto "Semper Fidelis" (Always Faithful).^[37]

   John Philip Sousa, the musician and composer, enlisted as a Marine
   apprentice at the age of 13, serving from 1867 until 1872, and again
   from 1880 to 1892 as the leader of the Marine Band.

   During the Spanish–American War (1898), Marines led American forces
   ashore in the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, demonstrating their
   readiness for deployment. At Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, the Marines seized
   an advanced naval base that remains in use today. Between 1899 and
   1916, the Corps continued its record of vigorous participation in
   foreign expeditions, including the Philippine–American War, the Boxer
   Rebellion in China (1899–1901), Panama, the Cuban Pacifications, the
   Perdicaris Incident in Morocco, Veracruz, Santo Domingo, and the Banana
   Wars in Haiti and Nicaragua; the experiences gained in
   counter-insurgency and guerrilla operations during this period were
   consolidated into the Small Wars Manual.^[42]

World War I[edit]

   During World War I veteran Marines served a central role in the late
   American entry into the conflict. The Marine Corps had a deep pool of
   officers and NCOs with battle experience, and experienced a small
   expansion. Here, the Marines fought their famed battle at Belleau Wood,
   creating the Marines' reputation in modern history. While its previous
   expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western
   world, the Marines' ferocity and toughness in France earned them the
   respect of the Germans, who rated them of stormtrooper
   quality.^[citation needed] Though Marines and American media reported
   that Germans had nicknamed them Teufel Hunden as meaning "Devil Dogs",
   there is no evidence of this in German records (as Teufelshunde would
   be the proper German phrase). Nevertheless, the name stuck.^[43]

   The Corps entered the war with 511 officers and 13,214 enlisted
   personnel, and by 11 November 1918 had reached a strength of 2,400
   officers and 70,000 enlisted.^[44] African-Americans were entirely
   excluded from the Marine Corps during this conflict.^[45]

   Between the World Wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Commandant John
   A. Lejeune, and under his leadership, the Corps presciently studied and
   developed amphibious techniques that would be of great use in World War
   II. Many officers, including Lt. Col. Earl Hancock "Pete" Ellis,
   foresaw a war in the Pacific with Japan and undertook preparations for
   such a conflict. Through 1941, as the prospect of war grew, the Corps
   pushed urgently for joint amphibious exercises and acquired amphibious
   equipment that would prove of great use in the upcoming conflict.^[46]

World War II[edit]

   Flag on Iwo Jima.

   In World War II, the Marines played a central role in the Pacific War.
   The battles of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, Cape
   Gloucester, Saipan, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting
   between Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army.

   The island of Iwo Jima served as the next area of battle, which began
   on 19 February 1945. The Japanese had learned from their defeats in the
   Marianas campaign and prepared many fortified positions on the island,
   including pillboxes and underground tunnels. The Japanese put up fierce
   resistance, but American forces reached the summit of Mount Suribachi
   on 23 February. The mission was accomplished at very high losses, with
   26,000 American casualties and 22,000 Japanese.^[47]

   By the end of the war, the Corps expanded from two brigades to six
   divisions, five air wings, and supporting troops, totaling about
   485,000 Marines. In addition, 20 defense battalions and a parachute
   battalion were set raised.^[48] Nearly 87,000 Marines were casualties
   during World War II (including nearly 20,000 killed), and 82 were
   awarded the Medal of Honor.^[49]

   Despite Secretary Forrestal's prediction, the Corps faced an immediate
   institutional crisis following the war due to the low budget. Army
   generals pushing for a strengthened and reorganized defense
   establishment attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the
   Navy and Army. Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support, and
   with the assistance of the so-called "Revolt of the Admirals,"the
   Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to dismantle the Corps, resulting in
   statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the National Security Act
   of 1947.^[50] Shortly afterward, in 1952 the Douglas-Mansfield Bill
   afforded the Commandant an equal voice with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
   on matters relating to the Marines and established the structure of
   three active divisions and air wings that remain today.

Korean War[edit]

   forces, December 1950.

   The Korean War (1950–1953) saw the hastily formed Provisional Marine
   Brigade holding the defensive line at the Pusan Perimeter. To execute a
   flanking maneuver, General Douglas MacArthur called on Marine air and
   ground forces to make an amphibious landing at Inchon. The successful
   landing resulted in the collapse of North Korean lines and the pursuit
   of North Korean forces north near the Yalu River until the entrance of
   the People's Republic of China into the war. Chinese troops surrounded,
   surprised and overwhelmed the overextended and outnumbered American
   forces. X Corps, which included the 1st Marine Division and the Army's
   7th Infantry Division, regrouped and inflicted heavy casualties during
   their fighting withdrawal to the coast, now known as the Battle of
   Chosin Reservoir.

   The fighting calmed after the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, but late
   in March 1953 the relative quiet of the war was broken when the Chinese
   Army launched a massive offensive on three outposts manned by the 5th
   Marine Regiment. These outposts were codenamed "Reno", "Vegas", and
   "Carson". The campaign was collectively known as the Nevada Cities
   Campaign. There was brutal fighting on Reno hill, which was eventually
   captured by the Chinese. Although Reno was lost, the 5th Marines held
   both Vegas and Carson through the rest of the campaign. In this one
   campaign, the Marines suffered approximately 1,000 casualties, while
   the Chinese suffered at least twice as many. Marines would continue a
   battle of attrition around the 38th Parallel until the 1953
   armistice.^[51]

   The Korean War saw the Corps expand from 75,000 regulars to a force of
   261,000 Marines, mostly reservists. 30,544 Marines were killed or
   wounded during the war and 42 were awarded the Medal of Honor.^[52]

Vietnam War[edit]

   in Vietnam, 1968.

   The Marine Corps served an important role in the Vietnam War taking
   part in such battles as Da Nang, Hue City, Con Thien and Khe Sanh.
   Individuals from the USMC operated in the Northern I Corps Regions of
   South Vietnam. While there, they were constantly engaged in a guerrilla
   war against the Viet Cong, along with an intermittent conventional war
   against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). Portions of the Corps were
   responsible for the less-known Combined Action Program (CAP) that
   implemented unconventional techniques for counter-insurgency and worked
   as military advisers to the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps. Marines
   were withdrawn in 1971, and returned briefly in 1975 to evacuate Saigon
   and attempt a rescue of the crew of the Mayagüez.^[53]

   Vietnam was the longest war for Marines; by its end, 13,091^[54]^[55]
   had been killed in action, 51,392 had been wounded, and 57 Medals of
   Honor had been awarded.^[56]^[57] Due to policies concerning rotation,
   more Marines were deployed for service during Vietnam than World War
   II.^[58]

   While recovering from Vietnam, the Corps hit a detrimental low point in
   its service history caused by courts-martial and non-judicial
   punishments related partially to increased unauthorized absences and
   desertions during the war. Overhauling of the Corps began in the late
   1970s, discharging the most delinquent, and once quality of new
   recruits improved, the Corps focused on reforming the NCO Corps, a
   vital functioning part of its forces.^[13]

Interim: Vietnam War to the War on Terror[edit]

   After the Vietnam War, the U.S. Marines resumed their expeditionary
   role, participating in the failed 1980 Iran hostage rescue attempt
   Operation Eagle Claw, the invasion of Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury)
   and the invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause). On 23 October 1983,
   the Marine headquarters building in Beirut, Lebanon, was bombed,
   causing the highest peacetime losses to the Corps in its history (220
   Marines and 21 other service members were killed) and leading to the
   American withdrawal from the country. The year 1990 saw Marines of the
   Joint Task Force Sharp Edge save thousands of lives by evacuating
   British, French and American nationals from the violence of the
   Liberian Civil War.

   During the Persian Gulf War (1990–1991), Marine task forces formed the
   initial core for Operation Desert Shield, while United States and
   Coalition troops mobilized, and later liberated Kuwait in Operation
   Desert Storm.^[37] Marines participated in combat operations in Somalia
   (1992–1995) during Operations Restore Hope, Restore Hope II, and United
   Shield to provide humanitarian relief.^[59] In 1997, Marines took part
   in Operation Silver Wake, the evacuation of American citizens from the
   US Embassy in Tirana, Albania.

Global War on Terrorism[edit]

   Following the attacks on 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush
   announced the Global War on Terrorism. The stated objective of the
   Global War on Terror is "the defeat of Al-Qaeda, other terrorist groups
   and any nation that supports or harbors terrorists."^[60] Since then,
   the Marine Corps, alongside other military and federal agencies, has
   engaged in global operations around the world in support of that
   mission.

   In spring 2009, President Barack Obama's goal of reducing spending in
   the Defense Department was led by Secretary Robert Gates in a series of
   budget cuts which did not result in significant changes in the Corps'
   budget and programs, cutting only the VH-71 Kestrel and resetting the
   VXX program.^[61]^[62]^[63] However, the National Commission on Fiscal
   Responsibility and Reform singled the Corps out for the brunt of a
   series of recommended cuts in late 2010.^[64] In light of budget
   sequestration in 2013, commandant Amos set a goal of a force of 174,000
   Marines.^[65] He testified that this was the minimum number that would
   allow for an effective response to even a single contingency operation,
   but it would reduce the peacetime ratio of time at home bases to time
   deployed down to a historical low level.^[66]

Operation Enduring Freedom[edit]

   Marines and other American forces began staging in Pakistan and
   Uzbekistan on the border of Afghanistan as early as October 2001 in
   preparation for Operation Enduring Freedom.^[67] The 15th and 26th
   Marine Expeditionary Units were the first conventional forces into
   Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in November 2001,
   and in December, the Marines seized Kandahar International
   Airport.^[68] Since then, Marine battalions and squadrons have been
   rotating through, engaging Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Marines of the
   24th Marine Expeditionary Unit flooded into the Taliban-held town of
   Garmsir on 29 April 2008, in Helmand Province, in the first major
   American operation in the region in years.^[69] In June 2009, 7,000
   Marines with the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade deployed to
   Afghanistan in an effort to improve security,^[70] and began Operation
   Strike of the Sword the next month.

   In late 2002, Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa was stood up
   at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti to provide regional security.^[71] Despite
   transferring overall command to the Navy in 2006, the Marines continued
   to operate in the Horn of Africa into 2007.^[72]

Iraq War[edit]

   The U.S. Marines served prominently in the Iraq War's Operation Iraqi
   Freedom. The I Marine Expeditionary Force, along with the U.S. Army's
   3rd Infantry Division, spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.^[73] The
   Marines left Iraq in the summer of 2003, but returned for occupation
   duty in the beginning of 2004. They were given responsibility for the
   Al Anbar Province, the large desert region to the west of Baghdad.
   During this occupation, the Marines spearheaded both assaults on the
   city of Fallujah in April (Operation Vigilant Resolve) and November
   2004 (Operation Phantom Fury) and saw intense fighting in such places
   as Ramadi, Al-Qa'im and Hīt.^[74] Their time in Iraq has courted
   controversy with the Haditha killings and the Hamdania
   incident.^[67]^[75] The Anbar Awakening and 2007 surge reduced levels
   of violence. On 1 March 2009, at Camp Lejeune, President Obama
   announced an accelerated withdrawal, promising all troops out by August
   2010.^[76] The Marine Corps officially ended its role in Iraq on 23
   January 2010 when they handed over responsibility for Al Anbar Province
   to the United States Army.^[76]^[77] US Marines would ultimately return
   to Iraq in the summer of 2014, in response to growing violence
   there.^[78]

Organization[edit]

   Main article: Organization of the United States Marine Corps

   The Department of the Navy, led by its Secretary, is the federal
   government agency which oversees the Marine Corps and the Navy. The
   most senior Marine officer is the Commandant, responsible to the
   Secretary of the Navy for organizing, recruiting, training, and
   equipping the Marine Corps so that its forces are ready for deployment
   under the operational command of the Combatant Commanders. The Marine
   Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions: the Headquarters
   (HQMC), the Operating Forces, the Supporting Establishment, and the
   Reserve (MARFORRES or USMCR).

   The Operating Forces are divided into three categories: Marine Corps
   Forces (MARFOR) assigned to unified commands, Security Forces guarding
   high-risk naval installations, and Security Guard detachments at
   American embassies. Under the "Forces for Unified Commands" memo, in
   accordance with the Unified Command Plan approved by the President,
   Marine Corps Forces are assigned to each of the Combatant Commands at
   the discretion of the Secretary of Defense. Since 1991, the Marine
   Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional
   unified combatant commands.^[79] Marine Corps Forces are divided into
   Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Pacific Command (MARFORPAC), each headed
   by a Lieutenant General. MARFORCOM has operational control of the II
   Marine Expeditionary Force; MARFORPAC has operational control of the I
   Marine Expeditionary Force and III Marine Expeditionary Force.^[31]

   The Supporting Establishment includes the Combat Development Command
   (MCCDC), the Logistics Command, the Recruiting Command and its depots,
   administration of Marine bases and air stations, and the Marine Band.

Relationship with other services[edit]

   In general, the Marine Corps shares many resources with the other
   branches of the United States military. However, the Corps has
   consistently sought to maintain its own identity with regards to
   mission, funding, and assets, while utilizing the support available
   from the larger branches. While the Marine Corps has far fewer
   installations both in the U.S. and worldwide than the other branches,
   many Army posts, Naval stations, and Air Force bases have a Marine
   presence. They also cross train with other countries.

United States Army[edit]

   Main article: United States Army
   A soldier from the 1st Infantry Regiment provides security for a joint
   Army-Marine patrol in Rawa in 2006; note the logo of the 2nd Marine
   Division on his shoulder sleeve insignia.

   The Marine Corps combat capabilities in some ways overlap those of the
   United States Army, the latter having historically viewed the Corps as
   encroaching on the Army's capabilities and competing for funding,
   missions, and renown. The attitude dates back to the founding of the
   Continental Marines, when General George Washington refused to allow
   the initial Marine battalions to be drawn from among his Continental
   Army. Most significantly, in the aftermath of World War II, Army
   efforts to restructure the American defense establishment included the
   dissolution of the Corps and the folding of its capabilities into the
   other services. Leading this movement were such prominent Army officers
   as General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George C.
   Marshall.^[50] With most of the 2000s spent in operations in
   Afghanistan and Iraq, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has voiced
   concerns that the Marines are becoming a "second Army".^[29]

   Doctrinally, Marine Corps' focus is on being expeditionary and
   independent, and places emphasis on amphibious mobility and combined
   arms; these make it a much lighter force than many units of the Army. A
   larger percentage of the Marine Corps' personnel and assets are in the
   combat arms (infantry, artillery, armor, and close air support) than
   the Army. However, the Army maintains much larger and diverse combat
   arms (infantry, armor, artillery, special operations), ground
   transport, logistics, while the Marines have a more diverse aviation
   arm (which constitutes a larger percentage of forces), and is usually
   organic to the MAGTF. Marines operate as expeditionary units and are
   completely amphibious. The Marine Corps focus on standardized infantry
   units with the other arms in support roles as the "Every Marine a
   rifleman" creed shows. This commitment to standardized units can be
   seen in the short-lived experiment of the Marine Raiders, which was
   controversial, while the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, born in
   World War II, enjoys high prestige to this day. The Army has a longer
   continuous tradition of special operations forces; the Marines joined
   the Special Operations Command with the establishment of MCSOCOM
   Detachment One in 2003.^[80]

   The Marines often leverage the Army's acquisition of ground equipment
   (as well as benefiting from Army research and development resources),
   training resources, and other support concepts. The majority of
   vehicles and weapons are shared with, modified, or inherited from Army
   programs.

   Culturally, marines and soldiers share most of the common U.S. military
   slang and terminology, but the Corps utilizes a large number of naval
   terms and traditions incompatible with the Army lifestyle, as well as
   their own unique vernacular. Many marines regard their culture to have
   a deep warrior tradition, with the ethos that "Every Marine a rifleman"
   and emphasis on cross-training and combat readiness despite actual job,
   be it infantry or otherwise. One source states marines tend to
   decentralize and push leadership to lower levels, while fostering
   initiative to a greater degree.^[81]

United States Navy[edit]

   Main article: United States Navy

   Richard.

   The Marine Corps' counterpart under the Department of the Navy is the
   United States Navy. As a result, the Navy and Marine Corps have a close
   relationship, more so than with other branches of the military.
   Whitepapers and promotional literature have commonly used the phrase
   "Navy-Marine Corps Team",^[82]^[83] or refer to "the Naval Service".
   Both the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commandant of the Marine
   Corps report directly to the Secretary of the Navy.

   Cooperation between the two services really begins with the training
   and instruction of Marines. The Corps receives a significant portion of
   its officers from the United States Naval Academy and Naval Reserve
   Officer Training Corps (NROTC). NROTC staff includes Marine
   instructors, while Marine drill instructors contribute to training of
   officers in the Navy's Officer Candidate School. Marine aviators are
   trained in the Naval Aviation training pipeline and are winged as Naval
   Aviators.
   A Marine (left) and a sailor (right) both dressed in combat gear, fire
   at a target on a desert weapons range

   Training alongside each other is viewed as critical, as the Navy
   provides transport, logistical, and combat support to put Marine units
   into the fight, for example, the Maritime Prepositioning ships and
   naval gunfire support. Most Marine aviation assets ultimately derive
   from the Navy, with regard to acquisition, funding, and testing, and
   Navy aircraft carriers typically deploy with a Marine squadron
   alongside Navy squadrons. Marines do not recruit or train noncombatants
   such as chaplains or medical/dental personnel; naval personnel fill
   these roles. Some of these sailors, particularly Hospital Corpsmen and
   Religious Programs Specialists, generally wear Marine uniforms
   emblazoned with Navy insignia. Conversely, the Marine Corps is
   responsible for conducting land operations to support naval campaigns,
   including the seizure of naval and air bases. Both services operate a
   network security team in conjunction.

   Marines and Sailors share many naval traditions, especially terminology
   and customs. Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients wear the Navy
   variant of this and other awards;^[25] and with few exceptions, the
   awards and badges of the Navy and Marine Corps are identical. Much of
   testing for new Marine Corps aircraft is done at NAS Patuxent River.
   The Navy's Blue Angels flight demonstration team is staffed by both
   Navy and Marine officers and enlisted men, and includes a Marine C-130
   Hercules aircraft.^[25]

   In 2007, the Marine Corps joined with the Navy and Coast Guard to adopt
   a new maritime strategy called A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century
   Seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same
   philosophical level as the conduct of war.^[84] This new strategy
   charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work
   collectively with each other and international partners to prevent
   regional crises, man-made or natural, from occurring or reacting
   quickly should one occur to avoid negative impacts to the United
   States.

   The Marines have reduced the requirement for large amphibious ships
   from 42 to a bare minimum of 33 ships; the fleet currently stands at 29
   ships and is likely to shrink in the future.^[85]

United States Air Force[edit]

   Main article: United States Air Force
   color photo of Marines pushing carted equipment from the open bay of a
   large cargo jet

   While the majority of Marine aviation assets ultimately derive from the
   Navy, some support is drawn from the United States Air Force. The
   Marine Corps makes extensive use of the USAF Air Mobility Command to
   airlift Marines and equipment.

   The Air Force traditionally provides the Joint Force Air Component
   Commander who controls "sorties for air defense, and long range
   interdiction and reconnaissance" while the MAGTF commander retains
   control of the Marines' organic aviation assets.^[86]^[87]

   The Marines provide some ground training for Air Force ground
   personnel, but most is handled by the Army.^[88]

Air-ground task forces[edit]

   Main article: Marine Air-Ground Task Force

   Today, the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine
   Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size. A
   MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), an aviation combat
   element (ACE), and a logistics combat element (LCE)^[89] under a common
   command element (CE), capable of operating independently or as part of
   a larger coalition. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in
   the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms,
   both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to
   act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations. The history
   of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness of overreliance on
   its sister services, and towards joint operations in general.^[13]

   A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest, a Marine Expeditionary Unit
   (MEU), based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite
   squadron, up to the largest, a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which
   ties together a Division, an Air Wing, and a Logistics Group under a
   MEF Headquarters Group. The seven MEUs constantly rotate between
   themselves and their attached components to maintain a high state of
   readiness. Each MEU is rated as capable of performing special
   operations.^[90] The three MEFs contain the vast majority of active
   duty deployable forces.

Special Operations[edit]

   Marine special operators conduct CQB training.

   Although the notion of a Marine special forces contribution to the
   United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was considered as
   early as the founding of USSOCOM in the 1980s, it was resisted by the
   Marine Corps. Then-Commandant Paul X. Kelley expressed the popular
   belief that Marines should support Marines, and that the Corps should
   not fund a special operations capability that would not support Marine
   operations.^[91] However, much of the resistance from within the Corps
   dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corps' 15th and 26th
   MEU(SOC)s "sit on the sidelines" during the very early stages of
   Operation Enduring Freedom while other special operations units
   actively engaged in operations in Afghanistan.^[80] After a three-year
   development period, the Corps agreed in 2006 to supply a 2,500-strong
   unit, Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), which would
   answer directly to USSOCOM.^[92]

Budget[edit]

   The Marine Corps accounts for around six percent of the military budget
   of the United States. The cost per Marine is $20,000 less than the cost
   of a serviceman from the other services, and the entire force can be
   used for both hybrid and major combat operations,^[93] enabling it to
   carry out full scale military action, peacekeeping operations and
   humanitarian aid – the entire Three Block War. Note that these per
   capita costs do not account for support provided by the Navy and other
   branches, such as the Navy's amphibious warfare ships and long-range
   air transport by the USAF.^[94] However given expected defense budget
   cuts, the Marines are well positioned for "fielding cheap options for
   an uncertain world."^[95] The Marine Corps budget is comparably well
   handled with a tiny fraction of the Anti-Deficiency Act violations of
   any of the other three major branches.^[96] In 2013 the USMC became the
   first American military branch to ever have a fully audited annual
   budget.^[97]

Marine Corps bases and stations[edit]

   Main article: List of United States Marine Corps installations

   The Marine Corps operates many major bases, 14 of which host operating
   forces, several support and training installations, as well as
   satellite facilities.^[98] Marine Corps' bases are concentrated around
   the locations of the Marine Expeditionary Forces, though reserve units
   are scattered throughout the United States. The principal bases are
   Camp Pendleton on the West Coast, home to I MEF; Camp Lejeune on the
   East Coast, home to II MEF; and Camp Butler in Okinawa, Japan, home to
   III MEF.

   Other important bases include air stations, recruit depots, logistics
   bases, and training commands. Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center
   Twentynine Palms in California is the Marine Corps' largest base and
   home to the Corps' most complex, combined-arms, live-fire training.
   Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia is home to Marine Corps Combat
   Development Command, and nicknamed the "Crossroads of the Marine
   Corps".^[99]^[100] Marines operate detachments at many installations
   owned by other branches, to better share resources, such as specialty
   schools. Marines are also present at, and operate many, forward bases
   during expeditionary operations. Finally, Marines operate a presence in
   the National Capital Region, with Headquarters Marine Corps scattered
   amongst the Pentagon, Henderson Hall, Washington Navy Yard, and Marine
   Barracks, Washington, D.C.

   As stated above, the Commandant of the Marine Corps is the
   highest-ranking officer of the Marine Corps; though he may not be the
   senior officer by time in grade and/or position of office. He is both
   the symbolic and functional head of the Corps, and holds a position of
   very high esteem among Marines. The Commandant has the U.S. Code Title
   10 responsibility to man, train, and equip the Marine Corps. He does
   not serve as a direct battlefield commander. The Commandant is a member
   of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reports to the Secretary of the
   Navy.^[101]

   The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps acts as a deputy to the
   Commandant. The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is the senior
   enlisted Marine, and acts as an adviser to the Commandant. Headquarters
   Marine Corps comprises the rest of the Commandant's counsel and staff,
   with deputy Commandants that oversee various aspects of the Corps
   assets and capabilities.

   The current and 35th Commandant is James F. Amos, who assumed the
   position on 22 October 2010 and vacated the office of Assistant
   Commandant.^[102] The 33rd and current Assistant Commandant is John M.
   Paxton, Jr.,^[103] while the 17th and current Sergeant Major is Micheal
   P. Barrett. Other Marine generals may be senior to the Commandant or
   Assistant Commandant in terms of time in grade and/or billet.

Rank structure[edit]

   Main article: United States Marine Corps rank insignia

   As in the rest of the United States military, Marine Corps ranks fall
   into one of three categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer,
   and enlisted, in decreasing order of authority (excluding the Air
   Force, which does not currently appoint warrant officers). To
   standardize compensation, each rank is assigned a pay grade.^[104]

Commissioned officers[edit]

   Commissioned officers are distinguished from other officers by their
   commission, which is the formal written authority, issued in the name
   of the President of the United States, that confers the rank and
   authority of a Marine officer. Commissioned officers carry the "special
   trust and confidence" of the President of the United States.^[21]
   Marine Corps commissioned officers are promoted based on an "up or out"

Enlisted[edit]

   Enlisted Marines in the pay grades E-1 to E-3 make up the bulk of the
   Corps' ranks, usually referred to simply as "Marines". Although they do
   not technically hold leadership ranks, the Corps' ethos stresses
   leadership among all Marines, and junior Marines are often assigned
   responsibility normally reserved for superiors. Those in the pay grades
   of E-4 and E-5 are non-commissioned officers (NCOs). They primarily
   supervise junior Marines and act as a vital link with the higher
   command structure, ensuring that orders are carried out correctly.
   Marines E-6 and higher are Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs),
   charged with supervising NCOs and acting as enlisted advisers to the
   command.

   The E-8 and E-9 levels each have two and three ranks per pay grade,
   respectively, each with different responsibilities. The First Sergeant
   and Sergeant Major ranks are command-oriented, serving as the senior
   enlisted Marines in a unit, charged to assist the commanding officer in
   matters of discipline, administration and the morale and welfare of the
   unit. Master Sergeants and Master Gunnery Sergeants provide technical
   leadership as occupational specialists in their specific MOS. The
   Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps also E-9, is a billet conferred on
   the senior enlisted Marine of the entire Marine Corps, personally
   selected by the Commandant. It is possible however for an enlisted
   Marine to hold a position senior to Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps
   as has been the case since the 1 October 2011, appointment of Sergeant
   Major Bryan B. Battaglia to the billet of Senior Enlisted Advisor to
   the Chairman which is deemed the senior enlisted member of the United
   States military.

Military Occupational Specialty[edit]

   Main articles: Military Occupational Specialty and List of United
   States Marine Corps MOS

   The Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) is a system of job
   classification. Using a four digit code, it designates what field and
   specific occupation a Marine performs. Segregated between officer and
   enlisted, the MOS determines the staffing of a unit. Some MOSs change
   with rank to reflect supervisory positions, others are secondary and
   represent a temporary assignment outside of a Marine's normal duties or
   special skill.

Initial training[edit]

   Main articles: United States Marine Corps Recruit Training and Officer
   Candidates School (United States Marine Corps)

   Every year, over 2,000 new Marine officers are commissioned, and 38,000
   recruits accepted and trained.^[31] All new Marines, enlisted or
   officer, are recruited by the Marine Corps Recruiting Command.^[105]

   Commissioned officers are commissioned mainly through one of three
   sources: Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), Officer
   Candidates School (OCS), or the United States Naval Academy (USNA).
   Following commissioning, all Marine commissioned officers, regardless
   of accession route or further training requirements, attend The Basic
   School (TBS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. At TBS, second
   lieutenants, warrant officers, and selected foreign officers learn the
   art of infantry and combined arms warfare.^[21]
   Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.

   Enlisted Marines attend recruit training, known as boot camp, at either
   Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego or Marine Corps Recruit Depot
   Parris Island. Historically, the Mississippi River served as the
   dividing line which delineated who would be trained where, while more
   recently, a district system has ensured a more even distribution of
   male recruits between the two MCRD facilities. Females attend only the
   Parris Island depot as part of the segregated Fourth Recruit Training
   Battalion. All recruits must pass a fitness test to start training;
   those who fail receive individualized attention and training until the
   minimum standards are reached. Marine recruit training is the longest
   among the American military services; it is 12 weeks long, compared to
   the Army's 10 weeks or the Navy's 9 weeks.^[106]

   Following recruit training, enlisted Marines then attend School of
   Infantry training at Camp Geiger or Camp Pendleton. Infantry Marines
   begin their combat training, which varies in length, immediately with
   the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB). Marines in all other MOSs other
   than infantry train for 29 days in Marine Combat Training (MCT),
   learning common infantry skills, before continuing on to their MOS
   schools which vary in length.^[107]

Uniforms[edit]

   Main article: Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps
   color drawings of four Marines wearing various uniforms.
   Left to right: Utility Uniform, Dress Uniform, Service Uniform, and
   Evening Dress Uniform

   The Marine Corps has the most stable and most recognizable uniforms in
   the American military; the Blue Dress dates back to the early 19th
   century^[31] and the service uniform to the early 20th century.
   Marines' uniforms are distinct in their simplicity; Marines do not wear
   unit patches or United States flags on any of their uniforms, nor name
   tags on their service and formal uniforms. Only a handful of skills
   (parachutist, air crew, explosive ordnance disposal, etc.) warrant
   distinguishing badges, and rank insignia is not worn on uniform
   headgear (with the exception of an officer's garrison service cover).
   While other servicemembers commonly identify with a sub-group as much
   as or more than their service (Ranger, submariner, aircrew, etc.),
   Marine uniforms do not reflect such division.

   Marines have three main uniforms: Dress, Service, and Utility. The
   Marine Corps Dress uniform is the most elaborate, worn for formal or
   ceremonial occasions. There are three different forms of the Dress
   uniform, the most common being the Blue Dress Uniform, called "Dress
   Blues" or simply "Blues". It is most often seen in recruiting
   advertisements and is equivalent to black tie. There is a "Blue-White"
   Dress for summer, and Evening Dress for formal (white tie) occasions.
   Versions with a khaki shirt in lieu of the coat (Blue Dress
   Charlie/Delta) are worn as a daily working uniform by Marine recruiters
   and NROTC staff.^[108]

   The Service Uniform was once the prescribed daily work attire in
   garrison; however, it has been largely superseded in this role by the
   utility uniform. Consisting of olive green and khaki colors, it is
   commonly referred to as "Greens". It is roughly equivalent in function
   and composition to a business suit.^[108]

   The Utility Uniform, currently the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform,
   is a camouflage uniform intended for wear in the field or for dirty
   work in garrison, though it has now been standardized for regular duty.
   It is rendered in a distinctive MARPAT pixelated camouflage (sometimes
   referred to as digitals or digies) that breaks up the wearer's shape,
   and serves to distinguish Marine uniforms from those of other services.
   In garrison, the woodland uniform is worn in winter, and the desert
   uniform is worn in summer.^[109] Marines consider the utilities a
   working uniform and do not permit their wear off-base, except in
   transit to and from their place of duty and in the event of an
   emergency. This, too, distinguishes them from other services, which
   have less stringent restrictions.^[108]

Culture[edit]

   Main article: Culture of the United States Marine Corps

   As in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions
   of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service
   apart from others. The Corps' embrace of its rich culture and history
   is cited as a reason for its high esprit de corps.^[21]

   The Marines' Hymn dates back to the 19th century and is the oldest
   official song in the United States armed forces. The Marine motto
   Semper Fidelis means always faithful in Latin, often appearing as
   Semper Fi; also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed
   by John Phillip Sousa. The mottos "Fortitudine" (With Fortitude); By
   Sea and by Land, a translation of the Royal Marines' Per Mare, Per
   Terram; and To the Shores of Tripoli were used until 1868.^[110] The
   Marine Corps emblem is the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, sometimes
   abbreviated "EGA", adopted in 1868.^[111] The Marine Corps seal
   includes the emblem, also is found on the flag of the United States
   Marine Corps, and establishes scarlet and gold as the official
   colors.^[112]

   Two styles of swords are worn by Marines: the officers' Mameluke Sword,
   similar to the Persian shamshir presented to Lt. Presley O'Bannon after
   the Battle of Derna, and the Marine NCO sword.^[31] The Marine Corps
   Birthday is celebrated every year on 10 November in a cake-cutting
   ceremony where the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine
   present, who in turn hands it off to the youngest Marine present. The
   celebration includes a reading of Marine Corps Order 47, Commandant
   Lejeune's Birthday Message.^[113] Close Order Drill is heavily
   emphasized early on in a Marine's initial training, incorporated into
   most formal events, and is used to teach discipline by instilling
   habits of precision and automatic response to orders, increase the
   confidence of junior officers and noncommissioned officers through the
   exercise of command and give Marines an opportunity to handle
   individual weapons.^[114]

   An important part of the Marine Corps culture is the traditional
   seafaring naval terminology derived from its history with the Navy.

Unofficial traditions and customs[edit]

   nickname for U.S. Marines. Devil Dog recruiting station, 628 South
   State Street"
   A recruiting poster makes use of the "Teufel Hunden" nickname.

   Marines have several generic nicknames:
     * Devil Dog has several oft-disputed explanations,^[115]^[116]^[117]
       but the tradition has expanded to include the English bulldog's
       association with the Corps, especially as a mascot.^[31]
     * gyrene has dropped out of popular use.^[118]
     * Leatherneck refers to a leather collar formerly part of the Marine
       uniform during the Revolutionary War period.^[119]
     * Jarhead has several oft-disputed explanations.^[120]

   Some other unofficial traditions include mottos and exclamations:
     * Oorah is common among Marines, being similar in function and
       purpose to the Army's hooah and the Navy's hooyah cries. Many
       possible etymologies have been offered for the term.^[121]
     * Semper Fi is a common greeting among serving and veteran Marines.
       It is short for the Marine Corps Motto "Semper Fidelis"
     * Improvise, Adapt and Overcome has become an adopted mantra in many
       units.^[122]

Veteran Marines[edit]

   The Corps encourages the idea that "Marine" is an earned title and most
   Marine Corps personnel take to heart the phrase "Once a Marine, Always
   a Marine". They reject the term "ex-Marine" in most circumstances.
   There are no regulations concerning the address of persons who have
   left active service, so a number of customary terms have come into
   common use:^[50]
     * "Ex-Marine" is used in reference to persons removed from the Corps
       with a less than a full and honorable discharge, especially those
       dishonorably discharged. Persons wishing to avoid this issue
       address these individuals by name with no reference to the
       Corps.^[citation needed]
     * "Marine" is acceptable and considered complimentary by most Corps
       personnel.
     * "Former Marine". "Veteran Marine" is acceptable in referring to
       anyone who has been honorably discharged from the Corps.
     * "Retired Marine" is generally reserved for those who have completed
       20 or more years of service are called "Lifers" and formally
       retired or those who have been medically retired.
     * According to one of the "Commandant's White letters" from
       Commandant Alfred M. Gray, Jr., referring to a Marine by their last
       earned rank is appropriate.^[123]

Martial arts program[edit]

   Main article: Marine Corps Martial Arts Program

   In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated an internally designed martial arts
   program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Due to an
   expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would
   become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer
   contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide
   Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal
   options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is a
   stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the "Warrior Ethos"
   within Marines.^[124] The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an
   eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together. MCMAP
   consists of punches and kicks from Taekwondo and Karate, opponent
   weight transfer from Jujitsu, ground grappling involving joint locking
   techniques and chokes from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and a mix of knife and
   baton/stick fighting derived from Eskrima, and elbow strikes and kick
   boxing from Muay Thai. Marines begin MCMAP training in boot camp, where
   they will earn the first of five available belts.^[125]

Equipment[edit]

   Main pages: Category:United States Marine Corps equipment and List of
   United States Marine Corps individual equipment

   As of 2013, the typical infantry rifleman carries $14,000 worth of gear
   (excluding night-vision goggles), compared to $2,500 a decade earlier.
   The number of pieces of equipment (everything from radios to trucks) in
   a typical infantry battalion has also increased, from 3,400 pieces of
   gear in 2001 to 8,500 in 2013.^[126]

Infantry weapons[edit]

   Main article: List of weapons of the United States Marine Corps
   Marines firing the MEU(SOC) pistol while garrisoned aboard ship.

   The basic infantry weapon of the Marine Corps is the M16 assault rifle
   family, with a majority of Marines being equipped with the M16A2 or
   M16A4 service rifles (the M16A2 is being phased out). The M4
   carbine^[127] and Colt 9mm SMG^[128] have also been issued. The
   standard side arm is the M9A1 pistol. Suppressive fire is provided by
   the M249 SAW (currently transitioning to the M27 IAR) and M240 machine
   guns, at the squad and company levels respectively. In addition,
   indirect fire is provided by the M203 grenade launcher and the M32
   grenade launcher in fireteams, M224 60 mm mortar in companies, and M252
   81 mm mortar in battalions. The M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun and
   MK19 automatic grenade launcher (40 mm) are available for use by
   dismounted infantry, though they are more commonly vehicle-mounted.
   Precision firepower is provided by the M40 series, and the Barrett
   M107, while designated marksmen use the DMR (being replaced by the M39
   EMR), and the SAM-R.^[129]

   The Marine Corps utilizes a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles
   to provide infantry with an offensive and defensive anti-armor
   capability. The SMAW and AT4 are unguided rockets that can destroy
   armor and fixed defenses (e.g., bunkers) at ranges up to 500 meters.
   The smaller and lighter M72 LAW can destroy targets at ranges up to 200
   meters.^[130]^[131] The Predator SRAW, FGM-148 Javelin and BGM-71 TOW
   are anti-tank guided missiles. The Javelin can utilize top-attack
   profiles to avoid heavy frontal armor. The Predator is a short-range
   fire-and-forget weapon; the Javelin and TOW are heavier missiles
   effective past 2,000 meters that give infantry an offensive capability
   against armor.^[132]

   The USMC is currently seeking to purchase commercial off-the-shelf
   bullet-trap or shoot-through rifle-grenades.^[133] These grenades will
   provide individual Marines additional firepower and will allow indirect
   fire against targets in defilade, behind walls and buildings or
   rooftops and elevated positions at ranges between 30 and 150
   meters.^[133]

Ground vehicles[edit]

   Main article: List of vehicles of the United States Marine Corps

   The Corps operates the same HMMWV and M1A1 Abrams tank as does the
   Army. However, for its specific needs, the Corps uses a number of
   unique vehicles. The LAV-25 is a dedicated wheeled armored personnel
   carrier, similar to the Army's Stryker vehicle, used to provide
   strategic mobility.^[134] Amphibious capability is provided by the
   AAV-7A1 Assault Amphibious Vehicle, an armored tracked vehicle that
   doubles as an armored personnel carrier, due to be replaced by the
   Amphibious Combat Vehicle, a faster vehicle with superior armor and
   weaponry. The threat of land mines and improvised explosive devices in
   Iraq and Afghanistan has seen the Corps begin purchasing heavy armored
   vehicles that can better withstand the effects of these weapons as part
   of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program.^[135] The
   Marine Corps has ordered 1,960 MRAP vehicles, hoping to use them to
   replace HMMWVs and some Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements on patrols
   in Iraq.^[136] The Logistics Vehicle System Replacement began replacing
   the Logistics Vehicle System in 2009.^[137]

   Prior to 2005, the Marines operated exclusively tube artillery – the
   M198 155 mm howitzer, now being replaced by the M777 155 mm howitzer.
   However, the Corps has expanded its artillery composition to include
   the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a truck-mounted
   rocket artillery system. Both are capable of firing guided
   munitions.^[138]

Aircraft[edit]

   Main article: United States Marine Corps Aviation

   The organic aviation capability of the Marine Corps is essential to its
   mission. The Corps operates both rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft
   mainly to provide assault support and close air support to its ground
   forces. However, other aircraft types are also used in a variety of
   support and special-purpose roles.

   The light transport and attack capabilities are provided by the Bell
   UH-1Y Venom and Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, which is being replaced by the
   Bell AH-1Z Viper.^[139] Medium-lift squadrons flying the CH-46E Sea
   Knight and CH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters are converting to the MV-22
   Osprey tiltrotor with superior range and speed. Heavy-lift squadrons
   are equipped with the CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter, eventually to
   be replaced with the upgraded CH-53K.^[140]
   A U.S. Marine AH-1Z Viper lands on the USS Makin Island in 2010.

   Marine attack squadrons fly the AV-8B Harrier II; while the
   fighter/attack mission is handled by the single-seat and dual-seat
   versions of the F/A-18 Hornet strike-fighter aircraft. The AV-8B is a
   V/STOL aircraft that can operate from amphibious assault ships, land
   air bases and short, expeditionary airfields, while the F/A-18 can only
   be flown from land or aircraft carriers. Both are slated to be replaced
   by 340 of the STOVL B version of the F-35 Lightning II, beginning
   training operations in 2008,^[141] and 80 of the carrier F-35C versions
   for deployment with Navy carrier air wings.^[142]^[143]^[144]

   II multirole fighter landing aboard the USS Wasp.

   In addition, the Corps operates its own organic aerial refueling and
   electronic warfare (EW) assets in the form of the KC-130 Hercules and
   EA-6B Prowler, respectively. The Hercules doubles as a ground refueller
   and tactical-airlift transport aircraft. The Prowler is one of only two
   active tactical electronic warfare aircraft left in the United States
   inventory, and has been labeled a "national asset"; frequently borrowed
   along with Navy Prowlers and EA-18G Growlers to assist in any American
   combat action since the retirement of the Air Force's own EW
   aircraft.^[145]

   The Marines operate unmanned aerial vehicles: the RQ-7 Shadow and Scan
   Eagle for tactical reconnaissance.^[146]^[147]

   Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 (VMFT-401), operates F-5E, F-5F
   and F-5N Tiger II aircraft in support of air combat adversary
   (aggressor) training. Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) operates
   the VH-3D Sea King and VH-60N Whitehawk helicopters in the VIP
   transport role, most notably Marine One, but are due to be replaced. A
   single Marine Corps C-130 Hercules aircraft, "Fat Albert", is used to
   support the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration team, the "Blue Angels".
