   A congressional committee is a legislative sub-organization in the
   United States Congress that handles a specific duty (rather than the
   general duties of Congress). Committee membership enables members to
   develop specialized knowledge of the matters under their jurisdiction.
   As "little legislatures", the committees monitor ongoing governmental
   operations, identify issues suitable for legislative review, gather and
   evaluate information, and recommend courses of action to their parent
   body. Woodrow Wilson once said, "it is not far from the truth to say
   that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst
   Congress in its committee rooms is Congress at work."^[1] It is neither
   expected nor possible that a member of Congress be an expert on all
   matters and subject areas that come before Congress.^[2] Congressional
   committees provide invaluable informational services to Congress by
   investigating and reporting about specialized subjects.

   Congress divides its legislative, oversight, and internal
   administrative tasks among approximately 200 committees and
   subcommittees. Within assigned areas, these functional subunits gather
   information; compare and evaluate legislative alternatives; identify
   policy problems and propose solutions; select, determine, and report
   measures for full chamber consideration; monitor executive branch
   performance (oversight); and investigate allegations of wrongdoing.^[3]
   While this investigatory function is important, procedures such as the
   House discharge petition process (the process of bringing a bill onto
   the floor without a committee report or mandatory consent from its
   leadership) are so difficult to implement that committee jurisdiction
   over particular subject matter of bills has expanded into
   semi-autonomous power. Of the 73 discharge petitions submitted to the
   full House from 1995 through 2007, only one was successful in securing
   a definitive yea-or-nay vote for a bill.^[4]

   The growing autonomy of committees has fragmented the power of each
   congressional chamber as a unit. This dispersion of power has possibly
   weakened the Legislative Branch relative to the other branches of the
   federal government, i.e., the Executive Branch, the courts. In his
   often cited article History of the House of Representatives, written in
   1961, American scholar George B. Galloway (1898–1967) said: "In
   practice, Congress functions not as a unified institution, but as a
   collection of semi-autonomous committees that seldom act in unison."
   Galloway went on to cite committee autonomy as a factor interfering
   with the adoption of a coherent legislative program.^[5] That autonomy
   remains a characteristic feature of the committee system in Congress
   today.

History[edit]

   In 1931, a reform movement temporarily reduced the number of signatures
   required on discharge petitions in the U.S. House of Representatives
   from a constitutional majority of 218 down to 145, i.e., from one-half
   to one-third of the House membership. This reform was abolished in a
   1935 counterattack led by the intra-House oligarchy.^[6] Thus the era
   of the Great Depression marks the last across-the-board change, albeit
   a short-lived one, in the autonomy of House standing committees.^[7]

   The modern committee structure stems from the Legislative
   Reorganization Act of 1946, the first and most ambitious restructuring
   of the standing committee system since the committee system was first
   developed. The 1946 act reduced the number of House committees from 48
   to 19 and the number of Senate committees from 33 to 15. Jurisdictions
   of all committee were codified by rule in their respective chambers,
   which helped consolidate or eliminate many existing committees and
   minimize jurisdictional conflicts.

   The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, a temporary
   committee established in 1993 to conduct a policy and historical
   analysis of the committee system, determined that while the 1946 Act
   was instrumental in streamlining the committee system, it did fail to
   limit the number of subcommittees allowed on any one committee. Today,
   Rules in the U.S. House of Representatives generally limit each full
   committee to five subcommittees, with the exception of Appropriations
   (12 subcommittees), Armed Services (7), Foreign Affairs (7), and
   Transportation and Infrastructure (6).^[8] There are no limits on the
   number of subcommittees in the U.S. Senate.

   Congress has convened several other temporary review committees to
   analyze and make recommendations on ways to reform and improve the
   committee system. For example, the Legislative Reorganization Act of
   1970 led to further reforms to open Congress to further public
   visibility, strengthen its decision-making capacities, and augment
   minority rights. The 1970 Act provided for recorded teller votes in the
   House's Committee of the Whole; allowed minority party committee
   members to call their own witnesses during a day of hearings;
   established the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs; and enhanced the
   research capabilities of two legislative support agencies: the
   Congressional Research Service and the General Accounting Office.

Senate committees[edit]

   Document saying "Joint resolution".
   After committee deliberation, the Senate passed a joint resolution in
   1955 authorizing Army General Douglas MacArthur to the post of General
   of the Armies of the United States.

   The first Senate committee was established April 7, 1789, to draw up
   Senate rules of procedure. In those early days, the Senate operated
   with temporary select committees, which were responsive to the entire
   Senate, with the full Senate selecting their jurisdiction and
   membership. This system provided a great deal of flexibility, as if one
   committee proved unresponsive, another could be established in its
   place. The Senate could also forgo committee referral for actions on
   legislation or presidential nominations. These early committees
   generally consisted of three members for routine business and five
   members for more important issues. The largest committee established
   during the 1st Congress had eleven members, and was created to
   determine salaries of the president and vice president. Also in the
   first session, the entire membership of the Senate was divided into two
   large committees, with half the senators on the committee to prepare
   legislation establishing the federal judiciary and the other half on
   the committee to define the punishment of crimes against the United
   States.

   , this system proved ineffective, so in 1816 the Senate adopted a
   formal system of 11 standing committees with five members each. Three
   of those committees, the Finance, Foreign Relations and the Judiciary
   Committees exist largely unchanged today, while the duties of the
   others have evolved into successor committees. With the advent of this
   new system, committees are able to handle long-term studies and
   investigations, in addition to regular legislative duties. According to
   the Senate Historical Office, "the significance of the change from
   temporary to permanent committees was perhaps little realized at the
   time." With the growing responsibilities of the Senate, the committees
   gradually grew to be the key policy-making bodies of the Senate,
   instead of merely technical aids to the chamber.

   Decatur, Illinois in 1905.

   By 1906, the Senate maintained 66 standing and select committees—eight
   more committees than members of the majority party. The large number of
   committees and the manner of assigning their chairmanships suggests
   that many of them existed solely to provide office space in those days
   before the Senate acquired its first permanent office building, the
   Russell Senate Office Building. There were so many committees that
   freshman Senator Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin was assigned
   chairmanship of the Committee to Investigate the Condition of the
   Potomac River Front at Washington. According to LaFollette, he "had
   immediate visions of cleaning up the whole Potomac River front. Then
   [he] found that in all its history, the committee had never had a bill
   referred to it for consideration, and had never held a meeting." In
   1920, the Congressional Directory listed nearly 80 committees,
   including the Committee on the Disposition of Useless Papers in the
   Executive Departments. By May 27, 1920, the Russell Senate Office
   Building had opened, and with all Senate members assigned private
   office space, the Senate quietly abolished 42 committees.^[9]

   Today the Senate operates with 20 standing and select committees. These
   select committees, however, are permanent in nature and are treated as
   standing committees under Senate rules.

House committees[edit]

   The first House committee was appointed on April 2, 1789, to "prepare
   and report such standing rules and orders of proceeding" as well as the
   duties of a Sergeant-at-Arms to enforce those rules.^[10] Other
   committees were created as needed, on a temporary basis, to review
   specific issues for the full House. The House relied primarily on the
   Committee of the Whole to handle the bulk of legislative issues. In
   response to the House's need for more detailed advice on certain
   issues, more specific committees with broader authority were
   established. One of the first was a three-member committee on April 29,
   1789, "to prepare and report an estimate of supplies ... and of nett
   [sic] produce of the impost". The Committee on Ways and Means followed
   on July 24, 1789, during a debate on the creation of the Treasury
   Department over concerns of giving the new department too much
   authority over revenue proposals. The House felt it would be better
   equipped if it established a committee to handle the matter. This first
   Committee on Ways and Means had 11 members and existed for just two
   months. It later became a standing committee in 1801, a position it
   still holds today.^[11]

Types of committees[edit]

   There are three main types of committees—standing, select or special,
   and joint.^[3]

   Standing committees are permanent panels identified as such in chamber
   rules (House Rule X, Senate Rule XXV).

   The house appropriations committee is a standing committee and meets
   regularly. In this instance, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
   administrator R. David Paulson was answering questions before the
   committee about the 2009 budget.

   Because they have legislative jurisdiction, standing committees
   consider bills and issues and recommend measures for consideration by
   their respective chambers. They also have oversight responsibility to
   monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdictions,
   and in some cases in areas that cut across committee jurisdictions.

   Most standing committees recommend funding levels—authorizations—for
   government operations and for new and existing programs. A few have
   other functions. For example, the Appropriations Committees recommend
   appropriations legislation to provide budget authority for federal
   agencies and programs. The Budget Committees establish aggregate levels
   for total spending and revenue that serve as guidelines for the work of
   the authorizing and appropriating panels.

   Select or special committees are established generally by a separate
   resolution of the chamber, sometimes to conduct investigations and
   studies, and, on other occasions, also to consider measures. Often,
   select committees examine emerging issues that do not fit clearly
   within existing standing committee jurisdictions, or that cut across
   jurisdictional boundaries. A select committee may be permanent or
   temporary (all current select committees in the House and Senate are
   considered permanent committees). Instead of select, the Senate
   sometimes uses the term special committee (as in the Special Committee
   on Aging).

   Joint committees are permanent panels that include members from both
   chambers, which generally conduct studies or perform housekeeping tasks
   rather than consider measures. For instance, the Joint Committee on
   Printing oversees the functions of the Government Printing Office and
   general printing procedures of the federal government. The chairmanship
   of joint committees usually alternates between the House and Senate. A
   conference committee is a temporary joint committee formed to resolve
   differences between competing House and Senate versions of a measure.
   Conference committees draft compromises between the positions of the
   two chambers, which are then submitted to the full House and Senate for
   approval.

   Other committees are also used in the modern Congress.

     * Subcommittees are formed by most committees to share specific tasks
       within the jurisdiction of the full committee. Subcommittees are
       responsible to, and work within the guidelines established by,
       their parent committees. In particular, standing committees usually
       create subcommittees with legislative jurisdiction to consider and
       report bills. They may assign their subcommittees such specific
       tasks as the initial consideration of measures and oversight of
       laws and programs in the subcommittees' areas.

     * Committee of the Whole—used by the House of Representatives, but
       not the modern Senate

     * Conference committee—are joint, ad hoc groups formed to work out
       the differences between similar bills from both houses.

     * Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is a statutory joint
       select committee created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, enacted
       on August 2, 2011. The act was intended to prevent the rapid
       process of sovereign default from the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling
       Crisis,^[12] and has been interpreted as a reaction to frustration
       over "partisan political wrangling" during an "already struggling
       recovery".^[13] The committee will have twelve members, six from
       the House and six from the Senate, evenly divided between Democrats
       and Republicans.^[14]

Current committees[edit]

   Main articles: List of United States House committees, List of United
   States Senate committees and List of defunct United States
   Congressional committees

   In the House of Representatives, there are 21 permanent committees, and
   20 in the United States Senate. Four joint committees operate with
   members from both houses on matters of mutual jurisdiction and
   oversight.

   Committees in the House of Representatives generally have more members,
   due its larger size, as compared to the smaller 100-member Senate.
   Senate rules fix the maximum size for many of its committees^[citation
   needed], while the House determines the size and makeup of each
   committee every new Congress.

   The roster of each committee is officially approved by a full vote of
   its house. However, those decisions (including who will serve as chair
   of each committee) are actually made by the party leadership.
   Considerations in making the assignments include each member's areas of
   expertise, the interests of their constituents, and seniority.
   Political favors also often come into play in committee
   assignments.^[citation needed]

       1924 the House passed the rule requiring Congressmen's signatures
