Northeastern United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This article is about the geographical region. For for other uses of
   the term, see Northeastern United States (disambiguation).
   The states shown in the two darkest red shades are included in the
   United States Census Bureau Northeast Region, with states in lighter
   shades included in other regional definitions (see Composition).

   The Northeastern United States, or simply the Northeast, is a
   geographical region of the United States bounded to the north by
   Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern
   United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The
   Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for
   the collection and analysis of statistics.^[1] The Census
   Bureau-defined region has a total area of 181,324 sq mi (469,630 km^2)
   with 162,257 sq mi (420,240 km^2) of that being land mass.^[2] Though
   lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the
   nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally
   diverse.^[3]^[4] Of the nation’s four census regions, the Northeast is
   the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing
   within urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.^[5]

Composition[edit]

   The Census Bureau has defined the Northeast region as comprising nine
   states: the New England states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,
   New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; and the Mid-Atlantic states
   of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.^[1]^[a] This definition has
   been essentially unchanged since 1880, and is widely used as a standard
   for data tabulation.^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10] The Census Bureau has
   acknowledged the limitations of this definition^[11] and the potential
   merits of a proposal created after the 1950 census that would include
   changing regional boundaries to include Delaware, Maryland, and
   Washington, D.C. with the Mid-Atlantic states, but ultimately decided
   that "the new system did not win enough overall acceptance among data
   users to warrant adoption as an official new set of general-purpose
   State groupings. The previous development of many series of statistics,
   arranged and issued over long periods of time on the basis of the
   existing State groupings, favored the retention of the summary units of
   the current regions and divisions."^[12] The Census Bureau confirmed in
   1994 that it would continue to "review the components of the regions
   and divisions to ensure that they continue to represent the most useful
   combinations of States and State equivalents."^[12] Many organizations
   and reference works follow the Census Bureau's definition for the
   region,^[13]^[14]^[15] however, other entities define the Northeastern
   United States in significantly different ways for various purposes. The
   Association of American Geographers divides the Northeast into two
   divisions- "New England", which consists of Maine, Vermont, New
   Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, and "Middle
   States", which consists of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and
   Delaware.^[16] Similarly, the Geological Society of America defines the
   Northeast as these same states but with the addition of Maryland and
   the District of Columbia.^[17]
   The Library of Congress defines the Northeastern states as those east
   of Mississippi River and north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers.

   Database Standards

   The Library of Congress, which provides overlapping definitions of
   various U.S. regions, broadly includes all the states east of
   Mississippi River and north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers, which
   includes the Census Bureau-defined states plus Delaware, Maryland,
   Washington, D.C., Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and
   Wisconsin.^[18] The narrowest definitions include only the states of
   New England.^[19] Other more restrictive definitions include New
   England and New York as part of the Northeast United States, but
   exclude Pennsylvania and New Jersey.^[20]^[21] States beyond the Census
   Bureau definition that other entities include in the Northeast United
   States are:

History[edit]

Indigenous peoples[edit]

   Main article: Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands

   Anthropologists recognize the "Northeastern Woodlands" as one of the
   cultural regions that existed in the Western Hemisphere at the time of
   European colonists in the 15th and later centuries. Most did not settle
   in North America until the 17th century. The cultural area, known as
   the "Northeastern Woodlands," in addition to covering the entire
   Northeast U.S., also covered much of what is now Canada and others
   regions of what is now the eastern United States.^[34] Among the many
   tribes that inhabited this area were those that made up the Iroquois
   nations and the numerous Algonquian peoples.^[35] In the United States
   of the 21st century, 18 federally recognized tribes reside in the
   Northeast.^[36]

Colonial history[edit]

   All of the states making up the Northeastern region were among the
   original Thirteen Colonies, though Maine and Vermont were part of other
   colonies before the United States became independent in the American
   Revolution. The two cultural and geographic regions that form parts of
   the Northeastern region have distinct histories.

New England[edit]

   The Landing of the Pilgrims, Henry A. Bacon (1877)
   Main article: History of New England

   The first Europeans to settle New England were Pilgrims from England,
   who landed in present-day Massachusetts in 1620.^[37] The Pilgrims
   arrived by the Mayflower and founded Plymouth Colony so they could
   practice religion freely.^[37] Ten years later, a larger group of
   Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston to form
   Massachusetts Bay Colony.^[38] In 1636, colonists established
   Connecticut Colony and Providence Plantations.^[39]^[40] Providence was
   founded by Roger Williams, who was banished by Massachusetts for his
   beliefs in freedom of religion, and it was the first colony to
   guarantee all citizens freedom of worship.^[40] Anne Hutchinson, who
   was also banished by Massachusetts, formed the town of Portsmouth.^[40]
   Providence, Portsmouth, and two other towns (Newport and Warwick)
   consolidated to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence
   Plantations.^[40]

   Although the first settlers of New England were motivated by religion,
   in more recent history, New England has become one of the least
   religious parts of the United States. In a 2009 Gallup survey, less
   than half of residents in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and
   Massachusetts reported religion as an important part of their daily
   life.^[41] In a 2010 Gallup survey, less than 30% of residents in
   Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts reported attending
   church weekly, giving them the lowest church attendance among U.S.
   states.^[42]

   New England played a prominent role in early American education.
   Starting in the 17th century, the larger towns in New England opened
   grammar schools, the forerunner of the modern high school.^[citation
   needed] The first public school in the English colonies was the Boston
   Latin School, founded in 1635.^[43] In 1636, the colonial legislature
   of Massachusetts founded Harvard College, the oldest institution of
   higher learning in the United States.^[44]

Mid-Atlantic[edit]

   Henry Hudson explored the area of present-day New York in 1609 and
   claimed it for the Netherlands. His journey stimulated Dutch interest,
   and the area became known as New Netherland. In 1625, the city of New
   Amsterdam (the location of present-day New York City) was designated
   the capital of the province.^[45] The Dutch New Netherland settlement
   along the Hudson River and, for a time, the New Sweden settlement along
   the Delaware River divided the English settlements in the north and the
   south. In 1664, Charles II of England formally annexed New Netherland
   and incorporated it into the English colonial empire.^[46] The
   territory became the colonies of New York and New Jersey.^[46] New
   Jersey was originally split into East Jersey and West Jersey until the
   two were united as a royal colony in 1702.^[46]

   In 1681, William Penn, who wanted to give Quakers a land of religious
   freedom, founded Pennsylvania and extended freedom of religion to all
   citizens.^[47]

Environment[edit]

Topography[edit]

   While most of the Northeastern United States lie in the Appalachian
   Highlands physio-graphic region, some are also part of the Atlantic
   coastal plain which extends south to the southern tip of Florida. The
   coastal plain areas (including Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Long Island
   in New York, most of New Jersey, Delaware, and the Chesapeake Bay
   region of Maryland) are generally low and flat, with sandy soil and
   marshy land.^[4] The highlands, including the Piedmont and the
   Appalachian Mountains, are generally heavily forested, ranging from
   rolling hills to summits greater than 5,000 feet (1,500 m), and pocked
   with many lakes.^[4] The highest peak in the Northeast is Mount
   Washington (New Hampshire), at 6,288 feet (1,917 m).^[48]

Land use[edit]

   As of 2007^[update], forest-use covered approximately 60% of the
   Northeastern states (including Delaware, Maryland, and the District of
   Columbia), about twice the national average. About 12% was cropland and
   another 4% grassland pasture or range. There is also more urbanized
   land in the Northeast (11%) than any other region in the U.S.^[26]

Climate[edit]

   The climate of the Northeastern United States is impacted by the
   position of the mountain ranges and lakes, as well as the proximity of
   the Atlantic Ocean. During the winter, a prevailing westerly flow of
   air masses combines with the polar jet stream to bring bitter cold and
   frequent storm systems to the region. A semi-permanent high pressure
   system over the subtropical Atlantic Ocean causes summers to be
   generally warm and humid.^[49] Average annual temperatures range from
   the 50s and 60s in the far southern and coastal areas to the 20s and
   30s in the far northern and mountainous areas.^[49] According to the
   Northeast Regional Climate Center, the average January temperature in
   its twelve-state region is 23.6 °F (−4.7 °C), with 3.07 inches (78 mm)
   of precipitation.^[50] This compares to July, when the regional average
   temperature is 69.9 °F (21.1 °C), with 4.25 inches (108 mm) of
   precipitation.^[51]

Wildlife[edit]

   The Northeast has 72 National Wildlife Refuges, encompassing more than
   500,000 acres (780 sq mi; 2,000 km^2) of habitat, and designed to
   protect some of the 92 different threatened and endangered species
   living in the region.^[36]

Demography[edit]

   New York City, the most populous city in the Northeast and all of the
   United States
   Philadelphia, the second most populous city in the Northeast and the
   fifth most populated city in the United States
   Boston, the most populated city in Massachusetts and the third most
   populated city in the Northeast

   As of the July, 2013 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, the population of the
   region totaled 55,943,073.^[52] With an average of 345.5 people per
   square mile, the Northeast is 2.5 times as densely populated as the
   second-most dense region, the South. Since the last century, the U.S.
   population has been shifting away from the Northeast (and Midwest)
   toward the South and West.^[53]

   The two U.S. Census Bureau divisions in the Northeast (New England and
   Mid-Atlantic) rank #1 and #2 among the 9 divisions in population
   density according to the 2013 population estimate. The South Atlantic
   region (233.1) was very close behind New England (233.2). Due to the
   faster growth of the South Atlantic region, it will take over the #2
   division rank in population density in the next estimate, dropping New
   England to 3rd position. New England is projected to retain the number
   3 rank for many, many years, as the only other lower-ranked division
   with even half the population density of New England is the East North
   Central division (192.1) and this region's population is projected to
   grow slowly. ^[b]^[54]

Politics[edit]

   Main article: Political party strength in U.S. states

   The Northeastern United States tended to vote Republican in federal
   elections through the first half of the 20th century, but the region
   has since the 1990s shifted to become the most Democratic in the
   nation.^[24] Results from a 2008 Gallup poll indicated that eight of
   the top ten Democratic states were located in the region, with every
   Northeastern state having a Democratic party affiliation advantage of
   at least ten points.^[59] The following table demonstrates Democratic
   support in the Northeast as compared to the remainder of the
   nation.^[60]

   Hampshire voted for George W. Bush in 2000).^[61] Bolded entries

Economy[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (July 2013)

   As of 2012^[update], the region accounts for approximately 23% of U.S.
   gross domestic product.^[63]

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees 34 nuclear reactors, eight
   for research or testing and 26 for power production in the Northeastern
   United States.^[25]

   New York City, considered a global financial center, is in the
   Northeast.

   The Federal Bureau of Prisons maintains 17 federal prisons and two
   affiliated private facilities in the region.^[32]

Culture[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (July 2013)

   Geographer Wilbur Zelinsky asserts that the Northeast region lacks a
   unified cultural identity,^[3] but has served as a "culture hearth" for
   the rest of the nation.^[64] Several much smaller geographical regions
   within the Northeast do have distinct cultural identities.^[3]

Landmarks[edit]

   Almost half of the National Historic Landmarks maintained by the
   National Park Service are located in the Northeastern United
   States.^[65]

Religion[edit]

   According to a 2009 Gallup poll, the Northeastern states differ from
   most of the rest of the U.S. in religious affiliation, generally
   reflecting the descendants of immigration patterns of the late 19th and
   early 20th centuries, with many Catholics arriving from Ireland, Italy,
   and eastern Europe. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,
   and New Jersey are the only states in the nation where Catholics
   outnumber Protestants and other Christian denominations. More than 20%
   of respondents in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont declared no
   religious identity.^[66]

Sports[edit]

   The Northeast region is home to 22 professional sports franchises in
   the "Big Four" leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB),^[67] with more than 110
   championships collectively among them.^[68] The region has also been
   noted for the relative prevalence of the traditionally Northeastern
   sports of hockey and lacrosse.^[69]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ The U.S. Census Bureau reorganized its administrative units and
       its regional offices do not cover the Census regions (the
       northeastern most regional office headquartered in New York City
       covers New England, New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico).^[6]
    2. ^ Based on U.S. Census Bureau population projections to 2030 (and
       assuming constant land area) the population density for the South
       Atlantic division will increase significantly to 294.6/sqmi, New
       England's density will increase to 249.2/sqmi and the East North
       Central division will increase only slightly to 200.2/sqmi. The
       division with the 5th highest density is projected to be the East
       South Central division at 111.6/sqmi.^[54]
    3. ^ Where each state, division and region ranks among the 50 states,
       9 districts and 4 regions in population density.
