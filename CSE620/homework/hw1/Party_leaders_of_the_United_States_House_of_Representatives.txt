   Party leaders and whips of the United States House of Representatives
   are elected by their respective parties in a closed-door caucus by
   secret ballot and are also known as floor leaders.^[1] The U.S. House
   of Representatives does not officially use the term "Minority Leader"
   although the media frequently does. The House instead uses the terms
   "Republican Leader" or "Democratic Leader" depending on which party
   holds a minority of seats.

   The current party leaders are: Majority (Republican) Leader Kevin
   McCarthy, Majority (Republican) Whip Steve Scalise, Minority
   (Democratic) Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Minority (Democratic) Whip Steny
   Hoyer.

Job description[edit]

   Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority
   Leader, the House Majority Leader's duties and prominence varies
   depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House.
   Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes
   on the floor. In some cases, Majority Leaders have been more
   influential than the Speaker; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent
   than Speaker Dennis Hastert. In addition, Speaker Newt Gingrich
   delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over
   scheduling legislation on the House floor.^[2]

   The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of
   Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is
   the counterpart to the Majority Leader. Unlike the Majority Leader, the
   Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the
   convening of the Congress. If the Minority Leader's party takes control
   of the House, and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats,
   the Minority Leader is usually the party's top choice for Speaker for
   the next Congress, while the Minority Whip is typically in line to
   become Majority Leader. The Minority Leader usually meets with the
   Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial
   issues.

   The Speaker, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, Majority Whip and
   Minority Whip all receive special office suites in the United States
   Capitol.

Selection[edit]

   The floor leaders and whips of each party are elected by their
   respective parties in a closed-door caucus by secret ballot.^[citation
   needed] The Speaker-elect is also chosen in a closed-door session
   although they are formally installed in their position by a public vote
   when Congress reconvenes.^[1]

   Like the Speaker of the House, the Minority Leaders are typically
   experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position. When
   Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress, she
   had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip
   in the 107th Congress. When her predecessor, Richard Gephardt, D-MO,
   became minority leader in the 104th House, he had been in the House for
   almost 20 years, had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for
   four years, had been a 1988 presidential candidate, and had been
   majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of
   the House in the November 1994 elections. Gephardt's predecessor in the
   minority leadership position was Robert Michel, R-IL, who became GOP
   Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House. Michel's
   predecessor, Republican John Rhodes of Arizona, was elected Minority
   Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service.

   By contrast, party leaders of the United States Senate have often
   ascended to their position despite relatively few years of experience
   in that chamber,^[citation needed] such as Lyndon B. Johnson, William
   F. Knowland, and Bill Frist. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor
   also had a comparatively quick rise to his current post - he was the
   youngest House Majority Leader in American history and was the first
   Jewish party leader in either chamber.

Duties[edit]

   The House Majority Leader's duties vary, depending upon the political
   makeup of the majority caucus. In several recent Sessions of Congress
   with the notable exception of the Pelosi Speakership, the Majority
   Leader has been primarily responsible for scheduling the House Floor's
   legislative calendar and direct management for all House committees.

   Per 19 U.S.C. § 2191(c)(1), an implementing bill for a fast track
   negotiating authority (trade promotion authority) trade agreement
   submitted by the President is introduced (by request) in the House by
   the Majority Leader of the House and (by request) in the Senate by the
   Majority Leader of the Senate.

History[edit]

   Before 1899, the majority party floor leader had traditionally been the
   Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the most powerful
   committee in the House, as it generates the Bills of Revenue specified
   in the Constitution as the House's unique power.^[3]

   The office of Majority Leader was created in 1899 and first occupied by
   Sereno Payne.^[4] Speaker David B. Henderson created the position to
   establish a party leader on the House floor separate from the Speaker,
   as the role of Speaker had become more prominent, and the size of the
   House had grown from 105 at the beginning of the century to
   356.^[citation needed]

   Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and continued
   through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for
   Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have
   directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of
   the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A.
   Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from
   1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs who died in a plane crash, and Dick Gephardt
   who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his
   party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only
   Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as
   his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently
   served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011
   and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In
   1998, with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both
   Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest
   the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis
   Hastert.

   Traditionally, the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority
   party in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command. For
   instance, when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after
   the 2010 elections, Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader.
   Despite this, Cantor and his successor, Kevin McCarthy, have been
   reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House, since Boehner
   is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans. However,
   there have been some exceptions. The most recent exception to this rule
   came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker
   Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006.^[5] In contrast, the Minority Leader
   is the undisputed leader of the minority party.

   When the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one
   party, the Speaker normally takes a low profile and defers to the
   President.^[citation needed] For that situation the House Minority
   Leader can play the role of a de facto "leader of the opposition",
   often more so than the Senate Minority Leader, due to the more partisan
   nature of the House and the greater role of leadership.

   When the Majority Leader's party loses control of the House, and if the
   Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy,
   convention suggests that they would become the Minority Leader and
   Minority Whip, respectively. As the minority party has one less
   leadership position after losing the speaker's chair, there may be a
   contest for the remaining leadership positions. Nancy Pelosi is the
   most recent example of an outgoing Speaker seeking the Minority Leader
   post to retain the House party leadership, as the Democrats lost
   control of the House in the 2010 elections. Previous Speakers whose
   party has lost control of the House have not returned to the party
   leadership (Tom Foley lost his seat, and Dennis Hastert returned to the
   backbenches and later resigned). However, outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi
   ran successfully for Minority Leader in the 112th Congress.^[6]^[7]

   Eric Cantor became the first House Majority Leader to lose a primary
   election in 2014. Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his
   resignation as Majority Leader, effective July 31, 2014,^[8]
   ^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13] and he subsequently resigned his seat in
   Congress.^[14] Almost immediately he picked up a job at investment bank
   Moelis for a reported package of $3.4 million, a considerable upgrade
   on his annual salary as majority leader of $193,400.^[15]

Responsibilities[edit]

   From an institutional perspective, the rules of the House assign a
   number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader. For
   example, Rule XII, clause 6, grant the minority leader (or his
   designee) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions;
   Rule II, clause 6, states the Inspector General shall be appointed by
   joint recommendation of the Speaker, majority leader, and minority
   leader; and Rule XV, clause 6, provides that the Speaker, after
   consultation with the minority leader, may place legislation on the
   Corrections Calendar. The minority leader also has other institutional
   duties, such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities.

   From a party perspective, the minority leader has a wide range of
   partisan assignments, all geared toward retaking majority control of
   the House. Five principal party activities direct the work of the
   minority leader.
    1. He or she provides campaign assistance to party incumbents and
       challengers.
    2. The minority leader devises strategies, in consultation with other
       partisan colleagues, that advance party objectives. For example, by
       stalling action on the majority party's agenda, the minority leader
       may be able to launch a campaign against a "do-nothing Congress."
    3. The minority leader works to promote and publicize the party's
       agenda.
    4. The minority leader, if his or her party controls the White House,
       confers regularly with the President and his or her aides about
       issues before Congress, the Administration's agenda, and political
       events generally.
    5. The minority leader strives to promote party harmony so as to
       maximize the chances for legislative and political success.

   The roles and responsibilities of the minority leader are not
   well-defined. To a large extent, the functions of the minority leader
   are defined by tradition and custom. A minority leader from 1931 to
   1939, Representative Bertrand Snell, R-N.Y., provided this "job
   description": "He is spokesman for his party and enunciates its
   policies. He is required to be alert and vigilant in defense of the
   minority's rights. It is his function and duty to criticize
   constructively the policies and programs of the majority, and to this
   end employ parliamentary tactics and give close attention to all
   proposed legislation."^[16]

   Since Snell's description, other responsibilities have been added to
   the job. These duties involve an array of institutional and party
   functions. Before examining the institutional and party assignments of
   the minority leader, it is worth highlighting the historical origin of
   this position.

   To a large extent, the minority leader's position is a 20th-century
   innovation. Prior to this time congressional parties were often
   relatively disorganized, so it was not always evident who functioned as
   the opposition floor leader. Decades went by before anything like the
   modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with
   official titles for those who were its official leaders. However, from
   the beginning days of Congress, various House members intermittently
   assumed the role of "opposition leader." Some scholars suggest that
   Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned as the
   first "minority leader" because in the First Congress he led the
   opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's fiscal
   policies.^[17]

   During this early period, it was more usual that neither major party
   grouping (Federalists and Democratic-Republicans) had an official
   leader. In 1813, for instance, a scholar recounts that the Federalist
   minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 "to represent a party
   comprising a distinct minority" and "to coordinate the actions of men
   who were already partisans in the same cause."^[18] In 1828, a foreign
   observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal
   party leadership on Capitol Hill:

          I found there were absolutely no persons holding the stations of
          what are called, in England, Leaders, on either side of the
          House.... It is true, that certain members do take charge of
          administration questions, and certain others of opposition
          questions; but all this so obviously without concert among
          themselves, actual or tacit, that nothing can be conceived less
          systematic or more completely desultory, disjointed.^[19]

   Internal party disunity compounded the difficulty of identifying
   lawmakers who might have informally functioned as a minority leader.
   For instance, "seven of the fourteen speakership elections from 1834
   through 1859 had at least twenty different candidates in the field.
   Thirty-six competed in 1839, ninety-seven in 1849, ninety-one in 1859,
   and 138 in 1855."^[20] With so many candidates competing for the
   speakership, it is not at all clear that one of the defeated lawmakers
   then assumed the mantle of "minority leader." The Democratic minority
   from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not
   "nominate a candidate for Speaker in two of these seven Congresses and
   nominated no man more than once in the other five. The defeated
   candidates were not automatically looked to for leadership."^[21]

   In the judgment of political scientist Randall Ripley, since 1883 "the
   candidate for Speaker nominated by the minority party has clearly been
   the Minority Leader."^[22] However, this assertion is subject to
   dispute. On December 3, 1883, the House elected Democrat John G.
   Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker. Republicans placed in nomination for
   the speakership J. Warren Keifer of Ohio, who was Speaker the previous
   Congress.^[23] Clearly, Keifer was not the Republicans' minority
   leader. He was a discredited leader in part because as Speaker he
   arbitrarily handed out "choice jobs to close relatives ... all at
   handsome salaries."^[24] Keifer received "the empty honor of the
   minority nomination. But with it came a sting -- for while this
   naturally involves the floor leadership, he was deserted by his
   [partisan] associates and his career as a national figure terminated
   ingloriously."^[25] Representative Thomas Reed, R-ME, who later became
   Speaker, assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in Keifer's
   stead. "[A]lthough Keifer was the minority's candidate for Speaker,
   Reed became its acknowledged leader, and ever after, so long as he
   served in the House, remained the most conspicuous member of his
   party.^[26]

   Another scholar contends that the minority leader position emerged even
   before 1883. On the Democratic side, "there were serious caucus fights
   for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873," indicating
   that the "nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership."^[27]
   Further, when Republicans were in the minority, the party nominated for
   Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers, including ex-Speaker James
   Blaine of Maine in 1875, former Appropriations Chairman James A.
   Garfield of Ohio, in 1876, 1877, and 1879, and ex-Speaker Keifer in
   1883. "It is hard to believe that House partisans would place a man in
   the speakership when in the majority, and nominate him for this office
   when in the minority, and not look to him for legislative
   guidance."^[27] This was not the case, according to some observers,
   with respect to ex-Speaker Keifer.

   In brief, there is disagreement among historical analysts as to the
   exact time period when the minority leadership emerged officially as a
   party position. Nonetheless, it seems safe to conclude that the
   position emerged during the latter part of the 19th century, a period
   of strong party organization and professional politicians. This era was
   "marked by strong partisan attachments, resilient patronage-based party
   organizations, and...high levels of party voting in Congress."^[28]
   Plainly, these were conditions conducive to the establishment of a more
   highly differentiated House leadership structure.^[29]

Minority Party Nominees for Speaker, 1865-1897[edit]

   While the Office of the House Historian only lists Minority Leaders
   starting in 1899,^[30] the minority's nominees for Speaker (at the
   beginning of each Congress) may be considered their party's leaders
   before that time.
     * 1865: James Brooks (D-NY)
     * 1867: Samuel S. Marshall (D-IL)
     * 1869: Michael C. Kerr (D-IN)
     * 1871: George W. Morgan (D-OH)
     * 1873: Fernando Wood (D-NY)
     * 1875: James Gillespie Blaine (R-ME)

Trends[edit]

   Two other points of historical interest merit brief mention. First,
   until the 61st Congress (1909–1910), "it was the custom to have the
   minority leader also serve as the ranking minority member on the two
   most powerful committees, Rules and Ways and Means."^[31] Today, the
   minority leader no longer serves on these committees; however, he or
   she appoints the minority members of the Rules Committee and influences
   the assignment of partisan colleagues to the Ways and Means Committee.

   Second, Democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to
   the speakership upon reclaiming majority status. Republicans have not
   always followed this leadership succession pattern. In 1919, for
   instance, Republicans bypassed James R. Mann, R-IL, who had been
   minority leader for eight years, and elected Frederick Gillett, R-MA,
   to be Speaker. Mann "had angered many Republicans by objecting to their
   private bills on the floor;" also he was a protégé of autocratic
   Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-IL (1903–1911), and many Members "suspected
   that he would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected
   Speaker."^[32] More recently, although Robert H. Michel was the
   Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the
   House in the 1994 midterm elections, he had already announced his
   retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign, including
   the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting
   day.

   In the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are
   controlled by one party, the Speaker normally assumes a lower profile
   and defers to the President. For that situation the House Minority
   Leader can play the role of a de facto "leader of the opposition",
   often more so than the Senate Minority Leader, due to the more partisan
   nature of the House and the greater role of leadership. Minority
   Leaders who have played prominent roles in opposing the incumbent
   President have included Gerald Ford, Richard Gephardt, Nancy Pelosi,
   and John Boehner.

Institutional functions[edit]

   The style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of
   elements, including personality and contextual factors, such as the
   size and cohesion of the minority party, whether his or her party
   controls the White House, the general political climate in the House,
   and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative
   agenda. Despite the variability of these factors, there are a number of
   institutional obligations associated with this position. Many of these
   assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book. Others
   have devolved upon the position in other ways. To be sure, the minority
   leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him
   or her as a Representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership
   functions. Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional
   role of the minority leader, because the majority party exercises
   disproportionate influence over the agenda, partisan ratios on
   committees, staff resources, administrative operations, and the
   day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities.

   Under the rules of the House, the minority leader has certain roles and
   responsibilities. They include the following:

   Drug Testing. Under Rule I, clause 9, the "Speaker, in consultation
   with the Minority Leader, shall develop through an appropriate entity
   of the House a system for drug testing in the House."

   Inspector General. Rule II, clause 6, states that the "Inspector
   General shall be appointed for a Congress by the Speaker, the Majority
   Leader, and the Minority Leader, acting jointly." This rule further
   states that the minority leader and other specified House leaders shall
   be notified of any financial irregularity involving the House and
   receive audit reports of the inspector general.

   Questions of Privilege. Under Rule IX, clause 2, a resolution "offered
   as a question of privilege by the Majority Leader or the Minority
   Leader ... shall have precedence of all other questions except motions
   to adjourn." This rule further references the minority leader with
   respect to the division of time for debate of these resolutions.

   Oversight Plans. Under Rule X, clause 2, not later "than March 31 in
   the first session of a Congress, after consultation with the Speaker,
   the Majority Leader, and the Minority Leader, the Committee on
   Government Reform shall report to the House the oversight plans" of the
   standing committees along with any recommendations it or the House
   leaders have proposed to ensure the effective coordination of
   committees' oversight plans.

   Committee on Standards of Official Conduct: Investigative
   Subcommittees. Rule X, clause 5, stipulates: "At the beginning of a
   Congress, the Speaker or his designee and the Minority Leader or his
   designee each shall appoint 10 Members, Delegates, or Resident
   Commissioners from his respective party who are not members of the
   Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to be available to serve on
   investigative subcommittees of that committee during that Congress."

   Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. "The Speaker and Minority
   Leader shall be ex officio members of the select committee but shall
   have no vote in the select committee and may not be counted for
   purposes of determining a quorum." In addition, each leader may
   designate a member of his leadership staff to assist him with his ex
   officio duties. (Rule X, clause 11).

   Motion to Recommit with Instructions. Under Rule XIII, clause 6, the
   Rules Committee may not (except in certain specified circumstances)
   issue a "rule" that prevents the minority leader or a designee from
   offering a motion to recommit with instructions.

   In addition, the minority leader has a number of other institutional
   functions. For instance, the minority leader is sometimes statutorily
   authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities; he or
   she and the majority leader each name three Members to serve as Private
   Calendar objectors; he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening
   the House per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent
   adjournment resolutions; he or she is a traditional member of the House
   Office Building Commission; he or she is a member of the United States
   Capitol Preservation Commission; and he or she may, after consultation
   with the Speaker, convene an early organizational party caucus or
   conference. Informally, the minority leader maintains ties with
   majority party leaders to learn about the schedule and other House
   matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as
   feasible.

Party functions[edit]

   The minority leader has a number of formal and informal party
   responsibilities. Formally, the rules of each party specify certain
   roles and responsibilities for their leader. For example, under
   Democratic rules for the 106th Congress, the minority leader may call
   meetings of the Democratic Caucus. He or she is a member of the
   Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; names the members of the
   Democratic Leadership Council; chairs the Policy Committee; and heads
   the Steering Committee. Examples of other assignments are making
   "recommendations to the Speaker on all Democratic Members who shall
   serve as conferees" and nominating party members to the Committees on
   Rules and House Administration. Republican rules identify generally
   comparable functions for their top party leader.

   Informally, the minority leader has a wide range of party assignments.
   Lewis Deschler, the late House Parliamentarian (1928–1974), summarized
   the diverse duties of a party's floor leader:

   A party's floor leader, in conjunction with other party leaders, plays
   an influential role in the formulation of party policy and programs. He
   is instrumental in guiding legislation favored by his party through the
   House, or in resisting those programs of the other party that are
   considered undesirable by his own party. He is instrumental in devising
   and implementing his party's strategy on the floor with respect to
   promoting or opposing legislation. He is kept constantly informed as to
   the status of legislative business and as to the sentiment of his party
   respecting particular legislation under consideration. Such information
   is derived in part from the floor leader's contacts with his party's
   members serving on House committees, and with the members of the
   party's whip organization.^[33]

   These and several other party roles merit further mention because they
   influence significantly the leader's overarching objective: retake
   majority control of the House. "I want to get [my] members elected and
   win more seats," said Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-MO. "That's
   what [my partisan colleagues] want to do, and that's what they want me
   to do."^[34]

   Five activities illustrate how minority leaders seek to accomplish this
   primary goal.

   Provide Campaign Assistance. Minority leaders are typically energetic
   and aggressive campaigners for partisan incumbents and challengers.
   There is hardly any major aspect of campaigning that does not engage
   their attention. For example, they assist in recruiting qualified
   candidates; they establish "leadership PACs" to raise and distribute
   funds to House candidates of their party; they try to persuade partisan
   colleagues not to retire or run for other offices so as to hold down
   the number of open seats the party would need to defend; they
   coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national
   party campaign committees; they encourage outside groups to back their
   candidates; they travel around the country to speak on behalf of party
   candidates; and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant
   financial contributions to the party's campaign committee. "The amount
   of time that [Minority Leader] Gephardt is putting in to help the DCCC
   [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee] is unheard of," noted a
   Democratic lobbyist."No DCCC chairman has ever had that kind of
   support."^[35]

   Devise Minority Party Strategies. The minority leader, in consultation
   with other party colleagues, has a range of strategic options that he
   or she can employ to advance minority party objectives. The options
   selected depend on a wide range of circumstances, such as the
   visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion
   within the majority party. For instance, a majority party riven by
   internal dissension, as occurred during the early 1900s when
   Progressive and "regular" Republicans were at loggerheads, may provide
   the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her
   priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party
   cohesion. Among the variable strategies available to the minority
   party, which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or
   at different stages of the lawmaking process, are the following:

   Cooperation. The minority party supports and cooperates with the
   majority party in building winning coalitions on the floor.

   Inconsequential Opposition. The minority party offers opposition, but
   it is of marginal significance, typically because the minority is so
   small.

   Withdrawal. The minority party chooses not to take a position on an
   issue, perhaps because of intraparty divisions.

   Innovation. The minority party develops alternatives and agendas of its
   own and attempts to construct winning coalitions on their behalf.

   Partisan Opposition. The minority party offers strong opposition to
   majority party initiatives, but does not counter with policy
   alternatives of their own.

   Constructive Opposition. The minority party opposes initiatives of the
   majority party, and offers its own proposals as substitutes.

   Participation. The minority party is in the position of having to
   consider the views and proposals of their president and to assess their
   majority-building role with respect to his priorities.^[36]

   A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may
   suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances. The
   purposes of obstruction are several, such as frustrating the majority
   party's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to
   the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party. "We know how to
   delay," remarked Minority Leader Gephardt^[37] Dilatory motions to
   adjourn, appeals of the presiding officer's ruling, or numerous
   requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary
   tactics. By stalling action on the majority party's agenda, the
   minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a "do-nothing
   Congress" and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of
   the House. To be sure, the minority leader recognizes that "going
   negative" carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party
   fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the
   general public.

   Promote and Publicize the Party's Agenda. An important aim of the
   minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas
   and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that
   energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as
   independents and swing voters. Despite the minority leader's restricted
   ability to set the House's agenda, there are still opportunities for
   him to raise minority priorities. For example, the minority leader may
   employ, or threaten to use, discharge petitions to try and bring
   minority priorities to the floor.^[38] If he or she is able to attract
   the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting
   majority party supporters, he or she can force minority initiatives to
   the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership. As a GOP
   minority leader once said, the challenges he confronted are to "keep
   our people together, and to look for votes on the other side."^[39]

   Minority leaders may engage in numerous activities to publicize their
   party's priorities and to criticize the opposition's. For instance, to
   keep their party colleagues "on message," they insure that partisan
   colleagues are sent packets of suggested press releases or "talking
   points" for constituent meetings in their districts; they help to
   organize "town meetings" in Members' districts around the country to
   publicize the party's agenda or a specific priority, such as health
   care or education; they sponsor party "retreats" to discuss issues and
   assess the party's public image; they create "theme teams" to craft
   party messages that might be raised during the one-minute, morning
   hour, or special order period in the House; they conduct surveys of
   party colleagues to discern their policy preferences; they establish
   websites that highlight and distribute party images and issues to
   users; and they organize task forces or issue teams to formulate party
   programs and to develop strategies for communicating these programs to
   the public.

   House minority leaders also hold joint news conferences and consult
   with their counterparts in the Senate—and with the president if their
   party controls the White House. The overall objectives are to develop a
   coordinated communications strategy, to share ideas and information,
   and to present a united front on issues. Minority leaders also make
   floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the House; they
   deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country; and they write
   books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements.
   They must also be prepared "to debate on the floor, ad lib, no notes,
   on a moment's notice," remarked Minority Leader Michel.^[40] In brief,
   minority leaders are key strategists in developing and promoting the
   party's agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the opposition's
   arguments and proposals.

   Confer With the White House. If his or her party controls the White
   House, the minority leader confers regularly with the President and his
   aides about issues before Congress, the Administration's agenda, and
   political events generally. Strategically, the role of the minority
   leader will vary depending on whether the President is of the same
   party or the other party. In general, minority leaders will often work
   to advance the goals and aspirations of their party's President in
   Congress. When Robert Michel, R-IL, was minority leader (1981–1995), he
   typically functioned as the "point man" for Republican presidents.^[41]
   President Ronald Reagan's 1981 policy successes in the Democratic
   controlled House was due in no small measure to Minority Leader
   Michel's effectiveness in wooing so-called "Reagan Democrats" to
   support, for instance, the Administration's landmark budget
   reconciliation bill. There are occasions, of course, when minority
   leaders will fault the legislative initiatives of their President. On
   an administration proposal that could adversely affect his district,
   Michel stated that he might "abdicate my leadership role [on this
   issue] since I can't harmonize my own views with the
   administration's."^[42] Minority Leader Gephardt, as another example,
   has publicly opposed a number of President Clinton's legislative
   initiatives from "fast track" trade authority to various budget
   issues.^[43]

   When the White House is controlled by the House majority party, then
   the House minority leader assumes a larger role in formulating
   alternatives to executive branch initiatives and in acting as a
   national spokesperson for his or her party. "As Minority Leader during
   [President Lyndon Johnson's] Democratic administration, my
   responsibility has been to propose Republican alternatives," said
   Minority Leader Gerald Ford, R-MI.^[44] Greatly outnumbered in the
   House, Minority Leader Ford devised a political strategy that allowed
   Republicans to offer their alternatives in a manner that provided them
   political protection. As Ford explained:

   "We used a technique of laying our program out in general debate," he
   said. When we got to the amendment phase, we would offer our program as
   a substitute for the Johnson proposal. If we lost in the Committee of
   the Whole, then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and
   get a vote on that. And if we lost on the motion to recommit, our
   Republican members had a choice: They could vote against the Johnson
   program and say we did our best to come up with a better alternative.
   Or they could vote for it and make the same argument. Usually we lost;
   but when you're only 140 out of 435, you don't expect to win many.^[45]

   Ford also teamed with Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, R-IL, to
   act as national spokesmen for their party. They met with the press
   every Thursday following the weekly joint leadership meeting. Ford's
   predecessor as minority leader, Charles Halleck, R-IN, probably
   received more visibility in this role, because the press and media
   dubbed it the "Ev and Charlie Show." In fact, the "Republican National
   Committee budgeted $30,000 annually to produce the weekly news
   conference."^[46]

   Foster Party Harmony. Minority status, by itself, is often an important
   inducement for minority party members to stay together, to accommodate
   different interests, and to submerge intraparty factional
   disagreements. To hold a diverse membership together often requires
   extensive consultations and discussions with rank-and-file Members and
   with different factional groupings. As Minority Leader Gephardt said:

          We have weekly caucus meetings. We have daily leadership
          meetings. We have weekly ranking Member meetings. We have party
          effectiveness meetings. There's a lot more communication. I
          believe leadership is bottom up, not top down. I think you have
          to build policy and strategy and vision from the bottom up, and
          involve people in figuring out what that is.^[47]

   Gephardt added that "inclusion and empowerment of the people on the
   line have to be done to get the best performance" from the minority
   party.^[48] Other techniques for fostering party harmony include the
   appointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with
   conflicting views to reach consensus on issues; the creation of new
   leadership positions as a way to reach out and involve a greater
   diversity of partisans in the leadership structure; and daily meetings
   in the Leader's office (or at breakfast, lunch, or dinner) to lay out
   floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party.

Party whips and assistant party leaders[edit]

Whips[edit]

   A whip manages his or her party's legislative program on the House
   floor. The whip keeps track of all legislation and ensures that all
   party members are present when important measures are to be voted upon.

   The Majority Whip is an elected member of the majority party who
   assists the Speaker of the House and the majority leader to coordinate
   ideas on, and garner support for, proposed legislation.

   The Minority Whip is a member of the minority party who assists the
   minority leader in coordinating the party caucus in its responses to
   legislation and other matters. However, the U.S. House of
   Representatives does not use the term "minority whip," instead calling
   the position "Republican Whip" or "Democratic Whip" depending on the
   minority party.

   The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip, who is the
   chief vote counter for his or her party. The current chief deputy
   majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry. Within the House
   Republican Conference, the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed
   position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House
   Leadership. The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy
   whips, led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip, which is the highest
   appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus. The current
   senior chief deputy minority whip, John Lewis, has held his post since
   1991.
     * List of Republican chief deputy whips:
          + David F. Emery, 1981-1983 (Minority)
          + Tom Loeffler, 1983-1987 (Minority)
          + Edward Rell Madigan, 1987-1989 (Minority)
          + Robert Smith Walker, 1989-1995 (Minority)
          + Dennis Hastert, 1995–1999 (Majority)
          + Roy Blunt, 1999–2003 (Majority)
          + Eric Cantor, 2003–2009 (Majority, 2003-2007) (Minority,
            2007-2009)
          + Kevin McCarthy, 2009–2011 (Minority)
          + Peter Roskam, 2011–2014(Majority)
          + Patrick McHenry, 2014–present (Majority)

   The current Democratic chief deputy whips are: John Lewis, Senior Chief
   Deputy Whip, Maxine Waters, Ed Pastor, Jan Schakowsky, Joseph Crowley,
   Diana DeGette, G. K. Butterfield, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Jim
   Matheson, and Peter Welch.

Assistant party leaders[edit]

   The position of Assistant Democratic Leader was established on January
   3, 2011 and filled by Jim Clyburn. It is said to replace the Assistant
   to the Leader post previously held by Chris Van Hollen, who had
   attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership
   hierarchy.
