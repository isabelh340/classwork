   The United States courts of appeals (or circuit courts) are the
   intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal court
   system. A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts
   within its federal judicial circuit, and in some instances from other
   designated federal courts and administrative agencies.

   The United States Courts of Appeals are considered among the most
   powerful and influential courts in the United States. Because of their
   ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of
   people, the United States Courts of Appeals have strong policy
   influence on U.S. law. Moreover, because the U.S. Supreme Court chooses
   to hear fewer than 100 of the more than 10,000 cases filed with it
   annually, the United States Courts of Appeals serve as the final
   arbiter on most federal cases.

   There are currently 179 judges on the United States Courts of Appeals
   authorized by Congress and Article III of the U.S. Constitution. These
   judges are nominated by the President of the United States and
   confirmed by the United States Senate. They have lifetime tenure,
   earning an annual salary of $211,200.

   There currently are thirteen United States courts of appeals, although
   there are other tribunals that have "Court of Appeals" in their titles,
   such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which hears appeals
   in court-martial cases, and the United States Court of Appeals for
   Veterans Claims, which reviews final decisions by the Board of
   Veterans' Appeals in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The eleven
   numbered circuits and the D.C. Circuit are geographically defined. The
   thirteenth court of appeals is the United States Court of Appeals for
   the Federal Circuit, which has nationwide jurisdiction over certain
   appeals based on their subject matter. All of the courts of appeals
   also hear appeals from some administrative agency decisions and
   rulemaking, with by far the largest share of these cases heard by the
   D.C. Circuit. The Federal Circuit hears appeals from specialized trial
   courts, primarily the United States Court of International Trade and
   the United States Court of Federal Claims, as well as appeals from the
   district courts in patent cases and certain other specialized matters.

   Decisions of the United States courts of appeals have been published by
   the private company West Publishing in the Federal Reporter series
   since the courts were established. Only decisions that the courts
   designate for publication are included. The "unpublished" opinions (of
   all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) are published separately in
   West's Federal Appendix, and they are also available in on-line
   databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw. More recently, court decisions
   are also available electronically on the official court websites.
   However, there are also a few federal court decisions that are
   classified for national security reasons.

   The circuit with the smallest number of appellate judges is the First
   Circuit, and the one with the largest number of appellate judges is the
   geographically-large and populous Ninth Circuit in the Far West. The
   number of judges that the U.S. Congress has authorized for each circuit
   is set forth by law in 28 U.S.C. § 44, while the places where those
   judges must regularly sit to hear appeals are prescribed in 28
   U.S.C. § 48.

   Although the courts of appeals are frequently referred to as "circuit
   courts", they should not be confused with the former United States
   circuit courts, which were active from 1789 to 1911, during the time
   when long-distance transportation was much less available, and which
   were primarily first-level federal trial courts that moved periodically
   from place to place in "circuits" in order to serve the dispersed
   population in towns and the smaller cities that existed then. The
   current "courts of appeal" system was established in the Judiciary Act
   of 1891, also known as the Evarts Act.^[Note 1]

Procedure[edit]

   Trials, at which witnesses and other evidence are presented to a jury
   or judge in order to determine the truth or facts regarding a
   particular case, are held only in courts with original jurisdiction,
   i.e., courts in which a lawsuit is originally (and properly) filed and
   which have the power to accept evidence from witnesses and make factual
   and legal determinations regarding the evidence presented. Such trial
   courts also determine punishments (in criminal cases) and remedies (in
   civil cases). Because the courts of appeals possess only appellate
   jurisdiction, they do not hold trials. Instead, appeals courts review
   decisions of trial courts for errors of law. Accordingly, an appeals
   court considers only the record (that is, the papers the parties filed
   and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial) from the trial
   court, and the legal arguments of the parties. These arguments, which
   are presented in written form, and can range in length from dozens to
   hundreds of pages, are ironically known as "briefs". Sometimes lawyers
   are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before
   the appeals judges. At such hearings, only the parties' lawyers speak
   to the court.

   The rules that govern the procedure in the courts of appeals are the
   Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. In a court of appeals, an appeal
   is almost always heard by a "panel" of three judges who are randomly
   selected from the available judges (including senior judges and judges
   temporarily assigned to the circuit). Some cases, however, receive an
   en banc hearing. Except in the Ninth Circuit Courts, the en banc court
   consists of all of the circuit judges who are on active status, but it
   does not include the senior or assigned judges (except that under some
   circumstances, a senior judge may participate in an en banc hearing
   when he or she participated at an earlier stage of the same case).

   Many decades ago, certain classes of federal court cases held the right
   of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. That
   is, one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court
   of appeals to the Supreme Court, and it had to accept the case. The
   right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of
   appeals was ended by an Act of Congress, the Judiciary Act of 1925.
   This law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, and it also
   reorganized many other things in the federal court system.

   The current procedure is that a party in a case may apply to the
   Supreme Court to review a ruling of the circuit court. This is called
   petitioning for a writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court may choose,
   in its sole discretion, to review any lower court ruling. In extremely
   rare cases, the Supreme Court may grant the writ of certiorari before
   the judgment is rendered by the court of appeals, thereby reviewing the
   lower court's ruling directly. Certiorari before judgment was granted
   in the Watergate scandal-related case, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.
   683 (1974), and in the 2005 decision involving the Federal Sentencing
   Guidelines, United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).

   A court of appeals may also pose questions to the Supreme Court for a
   ruling in the midst of reviewing a case. This procedure was formerly
   used somewhat commonly, but now it is quite rare. The Second Circuit,
   sitting en banc, attempted to use this procedure in the case United
   States v. Penaranda, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in
   Blakely v. Washington 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2), but the Supreme Court
   dismissed the question after resolving the same issue in another case,
   which had come before the Court through the standard procedure. The
   last instance of the Supreme Court accepting a set of questions and
   answering them was in a case in 1982.

   A court of appeals may convene a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel to hear
   appeals in bankruptcy cases directly from the bankruptcy court of its
   circuit. As of 2008^[update], only the First, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and
   Tenth Circuits have established a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. Those
   circuits that do not have a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel have their
   bankruptcy appeals heard by the District Court.

   Courts of appeals decisions, unlike those of the lower federal courts,
   establish binding precedents. Other federal courts in that circuit
   must, from that point forward, follow the appeals court's guidance in
   similar cases, regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the
   case should be decided differently.

   Federal and state laws can and do change from time to time, depending
   on the actions of Congress and the state legislatures. Therefore, the
   law that exists at the time of the appeal might be different from the
   law that existed at the time of the events that are in controversy
   under civil or criminal law in the case at hand. A court of appeals
   applies the law as it exists at the time of the appeal; otherwise, it
   would be handing down decisions that would be instantly obsolete, and
   this would be a waste of time and resources, since such decisions could
   not be cited as precedent. "[A] court is to apply the law in effect at
   the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in
   manifest injustice, or there is statutory direction or some legislative
   history to the contrary." Bradley v. Richmond Sch. Bd., 416 U.S. 696,
   711-12 (1974).

   However, the above rule cannot apply in criminal cases if the effect of
   applying the newer law would be to create an ex post facto law to the
   detriment of the defendant.

Attorneys[edit]

   In order to serve as counsel in a case appealed to a circuit court the
   attorney must be admitted to the bar of that circuit. Admission to the
   bar of a circuit court is granted as a matter of course to any attorney
   who is admitted to practice law in any state of the United States. The
   attorney submits an application, pays a fee, and takes the oath of
   admission. Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in
   writing or in open court before a judge of the circuit, and most courts
   of appeals allow the applicant attorney to choose which method he or
   she prefers.

Nomenclature[edit]

   When the courts of appeals were created in 1891, one was created for
   each of the nine circuits then existing, and each court was named the
   "United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit". When a
   court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893, it
   was named the "Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia", and it
   was renamed to the "United States Court of Appeals for the District of
   Columbia" in 1934. In 1948, Congress renamed all of the courts of
   appeals then existing to their current formal names: the court of
   appeals for each numbered circuit was named the "United States Court of
   Appeals for the _____ Circuit", and the "United States Court of Appeals
   for the District of Columbia" became the “United States Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit". The Tenth Circuit was
   created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit, and the
   Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth
   Circuit. The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the
   United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate
   division of the United States Court of Claims.

Judicial councils[edit]

   Main article: Judicial council (United States federal courts)

   Judicial councils are panels in each circuit that are charged with
   making "necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and
   expeditious administration of justice" within their circuits.^[1]^[2]
   Among their responsibilities is judicial discipline, the formulation of
   circuit policy, the implementation of policy directives received from
   the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the annual submission
   of a report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on
   the number and nature of orders entered during the year that relate to
   judicial misconduct.^[1]^[3] Judicial councils consist of the chief
   judge of the circuit and an equal number of circuit judges and district
   judges of the circuit.^[1]^[4]

History[edit]

   The Judiciary Act of 1789 established three circuits, which were groups
   of judicial districts in which United States circuit courts were
   established. Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices
   and the local district judge; the three circuits existed solely for the
   purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts. Some
   districts (generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice
   to reach) did not have a circuit court; in these districts the district
   court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court. As new
   states were admitted to the Union, Congress often did not create
   circuit courts for them for a number of years.

   The Midnight Judges Act reorganized the districts into six circuits,
   and created circuit judgeships so that Supreme Court justices would no
   longer have to ride circuit. This Act, however, was repealed in March
   1802, and Congress provided that the former circuit courts would be
   revived as of July 1 of that year. But it then passed the new Judiciary
   Act of 1802 in April, so that the revival of the old courts never took
   effect. The 1802 Act restored circuit riding, but with only one justice
   to a circuit; it therefore created six new circuits, but with slightly
   different compositions than the 1801 Act. These six circuits later were
   augmented by others. Until 1866, each new circuit (except the
   short-lived California Circuit) was accompanied by a newly created
   Supreme Court seat.
