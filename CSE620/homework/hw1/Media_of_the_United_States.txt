   Media of the United States consist of several different types of media:
   television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and Internet-based
   Web sites. The U.S. also has a strong music industry. Many of the media
   are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenue from
   advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material. American
   media conglomerates tend to be leading global players, generating large
   revenues as well as large opposition in many parts of the world. With
   the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, further deregulation
   and convergence are under way, leading to mega-mergers, further
   concentration of media ownership, and the emergence of multinational
   media conglomerates. These mergers enable tighter control of
   information.^[1] Currently, six corporations control roughly 90% of the
   media.^[2]^[3]^[4] Critics allege that localism, local news and other
   content at the community level, media spending and coverage of news,
   and diversity of ownership and views have suffered as a result of these
   processes of media concentration.^[5]

   Theories to explain the success of such companies include reliance on
   certain policies of the American federal government or a tendency to
   natural monopolies in the industry. See Media bias in the United
   States.

   The organisation Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an
   annual ranking of countries based upon the organisation's assessment of
   their press freedom records. In 2013-14 United States was ranked 46th
   out of 180 countries, a drop of thirteen points from the preceding
   year.^[6]^[7]

Radio[edit]

   Main article: Radio in the United States

   American radio broadcasts in two bands: FM and AM. Some stations are
   only talk radio – featuring interviews and discussions – while music
   radio stations broadcast one particular type of music: Top 40, hip-hop,
   country, etc. Radio broadcast companies have become increasingly
   consolidated in recent years. National Public Radio is the nation's
   primary public radio network, but most radio stations are commercial
   and profit-oriented.

   Talk radio as a political medium has also exploded in popularity during
   the 1990s, due to the 1987 repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, which meant
   that stations no longer had to "balance" their day by programming
   alternative points of view.^[citation needed]

   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)in 1970 had limited the
   number of radio station one person or company could own to 1 am and 1
   FM locally and 7 am and 7 FM stations nationally. See IBOC and HD
   Radio.

   A new form of radio that is gaining popularity is satellite radio. The
   two biggest subscriptions based radio services are Sirius Satellite
   Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which have recently merged to form Sirius
   XM Radio. Unlike terrestrial radio music channels are commercial free
   and other channels feature minimal commercials. Satellite radio also is
   not regulated by the FCC.

   Arbitron, a consumer research company, provides ratings (similar to the
   Nielsen ratings) for national and local radio stations in the United
   States.

Television[edit]

   Main article: Television in the United States
   See also: Cable television in the United States
   See also: Satellite television in the United States

   Ninety-nine percent of American households have at least one television
   and the majority of households have more than one. The four major
   broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC),
   Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company
   (ABC) and Fox.

   Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries.
   However, a number of states, including West Virginia, Maryland,
   Kentucky, and South Carolina, among others, do have state-owned public
   broadcasting authorities which operate and fund all public television
   stations in their respective states. The income received from the
   government is insufficient to cover expenses and stations also rely on
   corporate sponsorships and viewer contributions.

   DirecTV and Dish Network are the major satellite television providers,
   with 20 and 14 million customers respectively as of February 2014.^[8]
   Meanwhile, the major cable television providers are Comcast with 22
   million customers, Time Warner Cable with 11 million, and Cox
   Communications, Charter Communications, AT&T U-Verse and Verizon FiOS
   with 5-6 million each.

Motion pictures[edit]

   Main article: Cinema of the United States

   In the 20th century, the motion picture industry rose to become one of
   the most successful and powerful industries in the U.S. Along with
   other intellectual property industries, its relative importance to the
   American economy has strengthened as the importance of manufacturing
   and agriculture have decreased (due to globalization^[citation
   needed]).

Newspapers[edit]

   Main article: Newspapers in the United States

   Newspapers have declined in their influence and penetration into
   American households over the years. The U.S. does not have a national
   paper. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are sold in most
   U.S. cities.^[citation needed]

   Although the Times' primary audience has always been the people of New
   York City, the New York Times has gradually become the dominant
   national "newspaper of record." Apart from its daily nationwide
   distribution, the term means that back issues are archived on microfilm
   by every decent-sized public library in the nation, and the Times'
   articles are often cited by both historians and judges as evidence that
   a major historical event occurred on a certain date. The Los Angeles
   Times and the Wall Street Journal are also newspapers of record to a
   lesser extent. Although USA Today has tried to establish itself as a
   national paper, it has been widely derided by the academic world as the
   "McPaper" and is not subscribed to (let alone archived) by most
   libraries.

   Apart from the newspapers just mentioned, all major metropolitan areas
   have their own local newspapers. Typically, a metropolitan area will
   support at most one or two major newspapers, with many smaller
   publications targeted towards particular audiences. Although the cost
   of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has
   generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising
   revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the
   Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage.

   With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately
   owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own
   dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a
   handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by
   individuals or families.

   Most general-purpose newspapers are either being printed one time a
   week, usually on Thursday or Friday, or are printed daily. Weekly
   newspapers tend to have much smaller circulation and are more prevalent
   in rural communities or small towns. Major cities often have
   "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily paper(s), for
   example, New York City's Village Voice or Los Angeles' L.A. Weekly, to
   name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local
   business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers
   for local ethnic and social groups.

   Probably due to competition from other media, the number of daily
   newspapers in the U.S. has declined over the past half-century,
   according to Editor & Publisher, the trade journal of American
   newspapers. In particular, the number of evening newspapers has fallen
   by almost one-half since 1970, while the number of morning editions and
   Sunday editions has grown.

   For comparison, in 1950, there were 1,772 daily papers (and 1,450 – or
   about 70 percent – of them were evening papers) while in 2000, there
   were 1,480 daily papers (and 766—or about half—of them were evening
   papers.)

   Daily newspaper circulation is also slowly declining in America, partly
   due to the near-demise of two-newspaper towns, as the weaker newspapers
   in most cities have folded:
   Year Circulation
   1960 58.8 million
   1970 62.1 million
   1980 62.2 million
   1990 62.3 million
   2000 55.8 million

   The primary source of newspaper income is advertising – in the form of
   "classifieds" or inserted advertising circulars – rather than
   circulation income. However, since the late 1990s, this revenue source
   has been directly challenged by Web sites like eBay (for sales of
   secondhand items), Monster.com (jobs), and Craigslist (everything).

   Additionally, as investigative journalism declined at major daily
   newspapers in the 2000s, many reporters formed their own non-profit
   investigative newsrooms. Examples include ProPublica on the national
   level, Texas Tribune at the state level and Voice of OC at the local
   level.

   The largest newspapers (by circulation) in the United States are USA
   Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Los Angeles
   Times.

Magazines[edit]

   Main article: List of United States magazines

   Thanks to the huge size of the English-speaking North American media
   market, the United States has a large magazine industry with hundreds
   of magazines serving almost every interest, as can be determined by
   glancing at any newsstand in any large American city. Most magazines
   are owned by one of the large media conglomerates or by one of their
   smaller regional brethren.

   The U.S. has three leading weekly newsmagazines: Time, Newsweek and
   U.S. News and World Report. Time and Newsweek are center-left while
   U.S. News and World Report tends to be center-right. Time is well known
   for naming a "Person of the Year" each year, while U.S. News publishes
   annual ratings of American colleges and universities.

   The U.S. also has over a dozen major political magazines.

   Finally, besides the hundreds of specialized magazines that serve the
   diverse interests and hobbies of the American people, there are also
   dozens of magazines published by professional organizations for their
   members, such as Communications of the ACM (for computer science
   specialists) and the ABA Journal (for lawyers).

Internet[edit]

   Main article: Internet in the United States

   The Internet has provided a means for newspapers and other media
   organizations to deliver news and, significantly, the means to look up
   old news. Some organizations only make limited amounts of their output
   available for free, and charge for access to the rest. Other
   organizations allow their archives to be freely browsed. It is possible
   that the latter type obtain more influence, as they are true to the
   spirit of freedom of information by virtue of making it free. Anyone
   who has followed external links only to be confronted with a pay to
   view banner, might attest that the reputations of organizations that
   charge is not enhanced by their charging policy, particularly when the
   same information is available from sources that don't charge.

   The Internet, by means of making available such constantly growing news
   archives, is, in effect, writing our history as it happens, at a level
   of detail never before known. While proprietary archives are slowly
   exposed to the public after many decades, organizations that maintain
   immediately updating resources have more control over what will be
   remembered by the general public in the near future.
