   The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution
   protects the right of individuals^[1]^[2] to keep and bear
   arms.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled
   that the right vests in individuals, not merely collective militias,
   while also ruling that the right is not unlimited and does not prohibit
   all regulation of either firearms or similar devices.^[7] State and
   local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal
   government from infringing this right per the incorporation of the Bill
   of Rights. The Second Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, as
   part of the first ten amendments comprising the Bill of Rights.

   The Second Amendment was based partially on the right to keep and bear
   arms in English common-law and was influenced by the English Bill of
   Rights of 1689. Sir William Blackstone described this right as an
   auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense,
   resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in
   defense of the state.^[8]

   In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court of the United
   States ruled that, "The right to bear arms is not granted by the
   Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that
   instrument for its existence" and limited the applicability of the
   Second Amendment to the federal government.^[9] In United States v.
   Miller (1939), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government and
   the states could limit any weapon types not having a “reasonable
   relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated
   militia”.^[10]^[11]

   In the twenty-first century, the amendment has been subjected to
   renewed academic inquiry and judicial interest.^[11] In District of
   Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court handed down a landmark
   decision, expressly holding the amendment to protect an individual
   right to possess and carry firearms.^[12]^[13] In McDonald v. Chicago
   (2010), the Court clarified its earlier decisions that limited the
   amendment's impact to a restriction on the federal government,
   expressly holding that the Fourteenth Amendment applies the Second
   Amendment to state and local governments to the same extent that the
   Second Amendment applies to the federal government.^[14] Despite these
   decisions, the debate between the gun control and gun rights movements
   and related organizations continues.^[15]

   There are several versions of the text of the Second Amendment, each
   with capitalization or punctuation differences. Differences exist
   between the drafted and ratified copies, the signed copies on display,
   and various published
   transcriptions.^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19]^[20]^[21]^[22]^[23] The importance
   (or lack thereof) of these differences has been the source of debate
   regarding the meaning and interpretation of the amendment, particularly
   regarding the importance of the prefatory clause.

   One version was passed by the Congress,^[24]^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28]

   As passed by the Congress and preserved in the National Archives:^[29]

     A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
     State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
     infringed.

   As ratified by the States and authenticated by Thomas Jefferson,
   then-Secretary of State:^[30]

     A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free
     state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
     infringed.

   As written by scribe William Lambert as part of the original
   hand-written copy of the Bill of Rights approved by the House and
   Senate, which resides in the National Archives.

Pre-Constitution background

Influence of the English Bill of Rights of 1689

   The right to bear arms in English history is believed to have been
   regarded in English law as an auxiliary to the long-established natural
   right of self-defense, auxiliary to the natural and legally defensible
   rights to life.^[31] The English Bill of Rights of 1689 emerged from a
   tempestuous period in English politics during which two issues were
   major sources of conflict: the authority of the King to govern without
   the consent of Parliament and the role of Catholics in a country that
   was becoming ever more Protestant. Ultimately, the Catholic James II
   was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, and his successors, the
   Protestants William III and Mary II, accepted the conditions that were
   codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the
   authority of the King to disarm its subjects, after James II had
   attempted to disarm many Protestants, and had argued with Parliament
   over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.^[32] The
   bill states that it is acting to restore "ancient rights" trampled upon
   by James II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights
   created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have
   arms.^[33] In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court
   did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time
   of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was "clearly an individual
   right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia" and
   that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the
   granting of a new right to have arms.^[34]

   The text of the English Bill of Rights of 1689 includes language
   protecting the right of Protestants against disarmament by the Crown.
   This document states: "That the Subjects which are Protestants may have
   Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by
   Law."^[35] It also contained text that aspired to bind future
   Parliaments, though under English constitutional law no Parliament can
   bind any later Parliament.^[36] Nevertheless, the English Bill of
   Rights remains an important constitutional document, more for
   enumerating the rights of Parliament over the monarchy than for its
   clause concerning a right to have arms.

   The statement in the English Bill of Rights concerning the right to
   bear arms is often quoted only in the passage where it is written as
   above and not in its full context. In its full context it is clear that
   the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be
   disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely
   restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and
   unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:

     Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse
     evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour
     to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and
     Liberties of this Kingdome (list of grievances including) ... by
     causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at
     the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to
     Law, (Recital regarding the change of monarch) ... thereupon the
     said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their
     respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and
     free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious
     Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe
     in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually
     done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and
     Liberties, Declare (list of rights including) ... That the Subjects
     which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to
     their Conditions and as allowed by Law.^[35]

   The historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second
   Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new
   one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.^[37]^[38]

   The English Bill of Rights includes the proviso that arms must be as
   "allowed by law." This has been the case before and after the passage
   of the Bill. While it did not override earlier restrictions on the
   ownership of guns for hunting, it was written to preserve the hunting
   rights of the landed aristocracy and is subject to the parliamentary
   right to implicitly or explicitly repeal earlier enactments.^[39] There
   is some difference of opinion as to how revolutionary the events of
   1688–89 actually were, and several commentators make the point that the
   provisions of the English Bill of Rights did not represent new laws,
   but rather stated existing rights. Mark Thompson wrote that, apart from
   determining the succession, the English Bill of Rights did "little more
   than set forth certain points of existing laws and simply secured to
   Englishmen the rights of which they were already posessed [sic]."^[40]
   Before and after the English Bill of Rights, the government could
   always disarm any individual or class of individuals it considered
   dangerous to the peace of the realm.^[41] In 1765, William Blackstone
   wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England describing the right to
   have arms in England during the 18th century as a natural right of the
   subject that was "also declared" in the English Bill of
   Rights.^[42]^[43]

     The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at
     present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable
     to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which
     is also declared by the same statute I W. & M. st.2. c.2. and is
     indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural
     right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of
     society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of
     oppression.^[44]

   Although there is little doubt that the writers of the Second Amendment
   were heavily influenced by the English Bill of Rights, it is a matter
   of interpretation as to whether they were intent on preserving the
   power to regulate arms to the states over the federal government (as
   the English Parliament had reserved for itself against the monarch) or
   whether it was intent on creating a new right akin to the right of
   others written into the Constitution (as the Supreme Court decided in
   Heller). Some in the United States have preferred the "rights" argument
   arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need
   to have arms for self-defence was not really in question. Peoples all
   around the world since time immemorial had armed themselves for the
   protection of themselves and others, and as organized nations began to
   appear these arrangements had been extended to the protection of the
   state.^[45] Without a regular army and police force (which in England
   was not established until 1829), it had been the duty of certain men to
   keep watch and ward at night and to confront and capture suspicious
   persons. Every subject had an obligation to protect the king's peace
   and assist in the suppression of riots.^[46]

Experience in America prior to the U.S. Constitution

   Ideals that helped to inspire the Second Amendment in part are
   symbolized by the minutemen.^[47]

   Early English settlers in America viewed the right to arms and/or the
   right to bear arms and/or state militias as important for one or more
   of these purposes (in no particular
   order):^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]
     * enabling the people to organize a militia system.
     * participating in law enforcement;
     * deterring tyrannical government;^[56]
     * repelling invasion;
     * suppressing insurrection, allegedly including slave
       revolts;^[57]^[58]^[59]
     * facilitating a natural right of self-defense.

   Which of these considerations were thought of as most important and
   ultimately found expression in the Second Amendment is disputed. Some
   of these purposes were explicitly mentioned in early state
   constitutions; for example, the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776
   asserted that, "the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of
   themselves and the state".^[60]

   During the 1760s pre-revolutionary period, the established colonial
   militia was composed of colonists, including many who were loyal to
   British imperial rule. As defiance and opposition to British rule
   developed, a distrust of these Loyalists in the militia became
   widespread among the colonists, known as Patriots, who favored
   independence from British rule. As a result, some Patriots created
   their own militias that excluded the Loyalists and then sought to stock
   independent armories for their militias. In response to this arms build
   up, the British Parliament established an embargo on firearms, parts
   and ammunition on the American colonies.^[61]

   British and Loyalist efforts to disarm the colonial Patriot militia
   armories in the early phases of the American Revolution resulted in the
   Patriot colonists protesting by citing the Declaration of Rights,
   Blackstone's summary of the Declaration of Rights, their own militia
   laws and common law rights to self-defense.^[62] While British policy
   in the early phases of the Revolution clearly aimed to prevent
   coordinated action by the Patriot militia, some have argued that there
   is no evidence that the British sought to restrict the traditional
   common law right of self-defense.^[62] Patrick J. Charles disputes
   these claims citing similar disarming by the patriots and challenging
   those scholars' interpretation of Blackstone.^[63]

   The right of the colonists to arms and rebellion against oppression was
   asserted, for example, in a pre-revolutionary newspaper editorial in
   1769 Boston objecting to the British army suppression of colonial
   opposition to the Townshend Acts:

     Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military
     conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are
     of such nature, and have been carried to such lengths, as must serve
     fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon its
     inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a
     measure as prudent as it was legal: such violences are always to be
     apprehended from military troops, when quartered in the body of a
     populous city; but more especially so, when they are led to believe
     that they are become necessary to awe a spirit of rebellion,
     injuriously said to be existing therein. It is a natural right which
     the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of
     Rights, to keep arms for their own defence; and as Mr. Blackstone
     observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and
     law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of
     oppression.^[62]

   The armed forces that won the American Revolution consisted of the
   standing Continental Army created by the Continental Congress, together
   with regular French army and naval forces and various state and
   regional militia units. In opposition, the British forces consisted of
   a mixture of the standing British Army, Loyalist Militia and Hessian
   mercenaries. Following the Revolution, the United States was governed
   by the Articles of Confederation. Federalists argued that this
   government had an unworkable division of power between Congress and the
   states, which caused military weakness, as the standing army was
   reduced to as few as 80 men.^[64] They considered it to be bad that
   there was no effective federal military crackdown to an armed tax
   rebellion in western Massachusetts known as Shays' Rebellion.^[65]
   Anti-federalists on the other hand took the side of limited government
   and sympathized with the rebels, many of whom were former Revolutionary
   War soldiers. Subsequently, the Constitutional Convention proposed in
   1787 to grant Congress exclusive power to raise and support a standing
   army and navy of unlimited size.^[66]^[67] Anti-federalists objected to
   the shift of power from the states to the federal government, but as
   adoption of the Constitution became more and more likely, they shifted
   their strategy to establishing a bill of rights that would put some
   limits on federal power.^[68]

   Modern scholars Thomas B. McAffee and Michael J. Quinlan have stated
   that James Madison "did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when
   he drafted the Second Amendment; the right was pre-existing at both
   common law and in the early state constitutions."^[69] In contrast,
   historian Jack Rakove suggests that Madison's intention in framing the
   Second Amendment was to provide assurances to moderate Anti-Federalists
   that the militias would not be disarmed.^[70]

   One aspect of the gun control debate is the conflict between gun
   control laws and the right to rebel against unjust governments.
   Blackstone in his Commentaries alluded to this right to rebel as the
   natural right of resistance and self preservation, to be used only as a
   last resort, exercisable when "the sanctions of society and laws are
   found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression".^[71] Some
   believe that the framers of the Bill of Rights sought to balance not
   just political power, but also military power, between the people, the
   states and the nation,^[72] as Alexander Hamilton explained in 1788:

     [I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form
     an army of any magnitude[,] that army can never be formidable to the
     liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens,
     little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of
     arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their
     fellow-citizens.^[72]^[73]

   Some scholars have said that it is wrong to read a right of armed
   insurrection in the Second Amendment because clearly the founding
   fathers sought to place trust in the power of the ordered liberty of
   democratic government versus the anarchy of insurrectionists.^[74]^[75]
   Other scholars, such as Glenn Reynolds, contend that the framers did
   believe in an individual right to armed insurrection. The latter
   scholars cite examples, such as the Declaration of Independence
   (describing in 1776 "the Right of the People to...institute new
   Government") and the Constitution of New Hampshire (stating in 1784
   that "nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd,
   slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind").^[76]

   There was an ongoing debate beginning in 1789 about "the people"
   fighting governmental tyranny (as described by Anti-Federalists); or
   the risk of mob rule of "the people" (as described by the Federalists)
   related to the increasingly violent French Revolution.^[77] A
   widespread fear, during the debates on ratifying the Constitution, was
   the possibility of a military takeover of the states by the federal
   government, which could happen if the Congress passed laws prohibiting
   states from arming citizens,^[78] or prohibiting citizens from arming
   themselves.^[62] Though it has been argued that the states lost the
   power to arm their citizens when the power to arm the militia was
   transferred from the states to the federal government by Article I,
   Section 8 of the Constitution, the individual right to arm was retained
   and strengthened by the Militia Acts of 1792 and the similar act of
   1795.^[79]^[80]

Drafting and adoption of the Constitution

   Further information: Constitutional Convention
   James Madison (left) is known as the "Father of the Constitution" and
   "Father of the Bill of Rights"^[81] while George Mason (right) with
   Madison is also known as the "Father of the Bill of Rights"^[82]
   Patrick Henry (left) believed that a citizenry trained in arms was the
   only sure guarantor of liberty^[83] while Alexander Hamilton (right)
   wrote in Federalist No. 29 that "little more can be reasonably aimed
   at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly
   armed..."^[73]

   In March 1785, delegates from Virginia and Maryland assembled at the
   Mount Vernon Conference to fashion a remedy to the inefficiencies of
   the Articles of Confederation. The following year, at a meeting in
   Annapolis, Maryland, 12 delegates from five states (New Jersey, New
   York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia) met and drew up a list of
   problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the
   delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
   for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the
   absence of:^[84]^[85]
     * interstate arbitration processes to handle quarrels between states;
     * sufficiently trained and armed intrastate security forces to
       suppress insurrection;
     * a national militia to repel foreign invaders.

   It quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these
   problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the
   federal congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing
   army.^[86] Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution codified these
   changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and
   general welfare of the United States by doing the following:^[87]
     * raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use
       shall be for a longer term than two years;
     * provide and maintain a navy;
     * make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval
       forces;
     * provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the
       union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;
     * provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and
       for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service
       of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the
       appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the
       militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.

   Some representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers,
   because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing
   power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a
   bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal
   government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to
   overcome a militia.^[88] Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed
   populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to
   liberty of a standing army.^[89]^[90] Anti-federalists, on the other
   hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and
   enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new
   government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government
   would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in
   listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The
   Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the
   Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support
   amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the
   Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough
   Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for
   ratification.^[91] The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21,
   1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The
   remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two
   states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress
   had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for
   ratification.^[92] James Madison drafted what ultimately became the
   Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8,
   1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.

Ratification debates

   The debate surrounding the Constitution's ratification is of practical
   importance, particularly to adherents of originalist and strict
   constructionist legal theories. In the context of such legal theories
   and elsewhere, it is important to understand the language of the
   Constitution in terms of what that language meant to the people who
   wrote and ratified the Constitution.^[93]

   The Second Amendment was relatively uncontroversial at the time of its
   ratification.^[94] Robert Whitehill, a delegate from Pennsylvania,
   sought to clarify the draft Constitution with a bill of rights
   explicitly granting individuals the right to hunt on their own land in
   season,^[95] though Whitehill's language was never debated.^[96]

   There was substantial opposition to the new Constitution, because it
   moved the power to arm the state militias from the states to the
   federal government. This created a fear that the federal government, by
   neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military
   force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and
   navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the
   states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover.
   Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states:

          No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State,
          except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the
          united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such
          State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by
          any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the
          judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be
          deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense
          of such State; but every State shall always keep up a
          well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and
          accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use,
          in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a
          proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.^[97]^[98]

   In contrast, Article I, Section 8, Clause 16 of the U.S. Constitution
   states:

          To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the
          Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed
          in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States
          respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority
          of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed
          by Congress.^[99]

   A foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary
   period was the well justified concern about political corruption and
   governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents
   who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to
   acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers
   saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against
   tyranny. Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by
   declaring that it is "a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like
   this could ever be enslaved . . . Is it possible . . . that an army
   could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their
   brethren? or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen,
   who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?"^[100]
   Noah Webster similarly argued:

          Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as
          they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in
          America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the
          whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force
          superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any
          pretence, raised in the United States.^[101]^[102]

   George Mason argued the importance of the militia and right to bear
   arms by reminding his compatriots of England's efforts "to disarm the
   people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them . .
   . by totally disusing and neglecting the militia." He also clarified
   that under prevailing practice the militia included all people, rich
   and poor. "Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people,
   except a few public officers." Because all were members of the militia,
   all enjoyed the right to individually bear arms to serve
   therein.^[101]^[103]

   The framers thought the personal right to bear arms to be a paramount
   right by which other rights could be protected. Therefore, writing
   after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the election of
   the first Congress, James Monroe included "the right to keep and bear
   arms" in a list of basic "human rights", which he proposed to be added
   to the Constitution.^[101]^[104]

   Patrick Henry argued in the Virginia ratification convention on June 5,
   1788, for the dual rights to arms and resistance to oppression:

     Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone
     who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it
     but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are
     inevitably ruined.^[105]

   While both Monroe and Adams supported the Constitution being ratified,
   its most influential framer was James Madison. In Federalist No. 46, he
   confidently contrasted the federal government of the United States to
   the European kingdoms, which he contemptuously described as "afraid to
   trust the people with arms." He assured his fellow citizens that they
   need never fear their government because of "the advantage of being
   armed...."^[101]^[106]

   By January 1788, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and
   Connecticut ratified the Constitution without insisting upon
   amendments. Several specific amendments were proposed, but were not
   adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the
   Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which
   concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the
   militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution
   with an attached list of proposed amendments. In the end, the
   ratification convention was so evenly divided between those for and
   against the Constitution that the federalists agreed to amendments to
   assure ratification. Samuel Adams proposed that the Constitution:

          Be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just
          liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent
          the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens,
          from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless
          when necessary for the defence of the United States, or of some
          one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning,
          in a peaceable and orderly manner, the federal legislature, for
          a redress of their grievances: or to subject the people to
          unreasonable searches and seizures.^[101]

Conflict and compromise in Congress produce the Bill of Rights

   James Madison's initial proposal for a bill of rights was brought to
   the floor of the House of Representatives on June 8, 1789, during the
   first session of Congress. The initial proposed passage relating to
   arms was:

     The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
     infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best
     security of a free country but no person religiously scrupulous of
     bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in
     person.^[107]

   On July 21, Madison again raised the issue of his bill and proposed a
   select committee be created to report on it. The House voted in favor
   of Madison's motion,^[108] and the Bill of Rights entered committee for
   review. The committee returned to the House a reworded version of the
   Second Amendment on July 28.^[109] On August 17, that version was read
   into the Journal:

     A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being
     the best security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
     and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no person religiously
     scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.^[110]

   In late August 1789, the House debated and modified the Second
   Amendment. These debates revolved primarily around risk of
   "mal-administration of the government" using the "religiously
   scrupulous" clause to destroy the militia as Great Britain had
   attempted to destroy the militia at the commencement of the American
   Revolution. These concerns were addressed by modifying the final
   clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the
   Senate:

     A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being
     the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep
     and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously
     scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military
     service in person.

   The next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the
   House and entered it into the Senate Journal. However, the Senate
   scribe added a comma before "shall not be infringed" and changed the
   semicolon separating that phrase from the religious exemption portion
   to a comma:

     A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being
     the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep
     and bear arms, shall not be infringed, but no one religiously
     scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military
     service in person.^[111]

   By this time, the proposed right to keep and bear arms was in a
   separate amendment, instead of being in a single amendment together
   with other proposed rights such as the due process right. As a
   Representative explained, this change allowed each amendment to "be
   passed upon distinctly by the States."^[112] On September 4, the Senate
   voted to change the language of the Second Amendment by removing the
   definition of militia, and striking the conscientious objector clause:

     A well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state,
     the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
     infringed.^[113]

   The Senate returned to this amendment for a final time on September 9.
   A proposal to insert the words "for the common defence" next to the
   words "bear arms" was defeated. An extraneous comma added on August 25
   was also removed.^[114] The Senate then slightly modified the language
   and voted to return the Bill of Rights to the House. The final version
   passed by the Senate was:

     A well regulated militia being the security of a free state, the
     right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

   The House voted on September 21, 1789 to accept the changes made by the
   Senate, but the amendment as finally entered into the House journal
   contained the additional words "necessary to":

     A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free
     State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be
     infringed.^[115]

   On December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to
   the Constitution) was adopted, having been ratified by three-fourths of
   the states.

Militia in the decades following ratification

   Ketland brass barrel smooth bore pistol common in Colonial America

   During the first two decades following the ratification of the Second
   Amendment, public opposition to standing armies, among Anti-Federalists
   and Federalists alike, persisted and manifested itself locally as a
   general reluctance to create a professional armed police force, instead
   relying on county sheriffs, constables and night watchmen to enforce
   local ordinances.^[116] Though sometimes compensated, often these
   positions were unpaid—held as a matter of civic duty. In these early
   decades, law enforcement officers were rarely armed with firearms,
   using billy clubs as their sole defensive weapons.^[116] In serious
   emergencies, a posse comitatus, militia company, or group of vigilantes
   assumed law enforcement duties; these individuals were more likely than
   the local sheriff to be armed with firearms.^[116] On May 8, 1792,
   Congress passed "[a]n act more effectually to provide for the National
   Defence, by establishing an Uniform Militia throughout the United
   States" requiring:

     [E]ach and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the
     respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of
     eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is
     herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled
     in the militia...[and] every citizen so enrolled and notified,
     shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good
     musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints,
     and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than
     twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or
     firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and
     ball: or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch and powder-horn,
     twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a
     pound of powder; and shall appear, so armed, accoutred and provided,
     when called out to exercise, or into service, except, that when
     called out on company days to exercise only, he may appear without a
     knapsack.^[117]

   The act also gave specific instructions to domestic weapon
   manufacturers "that from and after five years from the passing of this
   act, muskets for arming the militia as herein required, shall be of
   bores sufficient for balls of the eighteenth part of a pound."^[117] In
   practice, private acquisition and maintenance of rifles and muskets
   meeting specifications and readily available for militia duty proved
   problematic; estimates of compliance ranged from 10 to 65
   percent.^[118] Compliance with the enrollment provisions was also poor.
   In addition to the exemptions granted by the law for custom-house
   officers and their clerks, post-officers and stage drivers employed in
   the care and conveyance of U.S. mail, ferrymen, export inspectors,
   pilots, merchant mariners and those deployed at sea in active service;
   state legislatures granted numerous exemptions under Section 2 of the
   Act, including exemptions for: clergy, conscientious objectors,
   teachers, students, and jurors. And though a number of able-bodied
   white men remained available for service, many simply did not show up
   for militia duty. Penalties for failure to appear were enforced
   sporadically and selectively.^[119] None are mentioned in the
   legislation.^[117]
   The Model 1795 Musket was made in the U.S. and used in the War of 1812

   The first test of the militia system occurred in July 1794, when a
   group of disaffected Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against federal tax
   collectors whom they viewed as illegitimate tools of tyrannical
   power.^[120] Attempts by the four adjoining states to raise a militia
   for nationalization to suppress the insurrection proved inadequate.
   When officials resorted to drafting men, they faced bitter resistance.
   Forthcoming soldiers consisted primarily of draftees or paid
   substitutes as well as poor enlistees lured by enlistment bonuses. The
   officers, however, were of a higher quality, responding out of a sense
   of civic duty and patriotism, and generally critical of the rank and
   file.^[121] Most of the 13,000 soldiers lacked the required weaponry;
   the war department provided nearly two-thirds of them with guns.^[121]
   In October, President George Washington and General Harry Lee marched
   on the 7,000 rebels who conceded without fighting. The episode provoked
   criticism of the citizen militia and inspired calls for a universal
   militia. Secretary of War Henry Knox and Vice-President John Adams had
   lobbied Congress to establish federal armories to stock imported
   weapons and encourage domestic production.^[121] Congress did
   subsequently pass "[a]n act for the erecting and repairing of Arsenals
   and Magazines" on April 2, 1794, two months prior to the
   insurrection.^[122] Nevertheless, the militia continued to deteriorate
   and twenty years later, the militia's poor condition contributed to
   several losses in the War of 1812, including the sacking of Washington,
   D.C., and the burning of the White House in 1814.^[119]

Scholarly commentary

   William Rawle of Pennsylvania (left) was a lawyer and district
   attorney; Thomas M. Cooley of Michigan (right) was an educator and
   judge.
   Joseph Story of Massachusetts (left) became a U.S. Supreme Court
   justice; Tench Coxe of Pennsylvania (right) was a political economist
   and delegate to the Continental Congress.

Tench Coxe

   In 1792, Tench Coxe made the following point in a commentary on the
   Second Amendment:^[123]

     As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before
     them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which
     must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert
     their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are
     confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their
     private arms.^[124]^[125]

Tucker/Blackstone

   The earliest published commentary on the Second Amendment by a major
   constitutional theorist was by St. George Tucker. He annotated a
   five-volume edition of Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the
   Laws of England, a critical legal reference for early American
   attorneys published in 1803.^[126] Tucker wrote:

     A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free
     state, the right of the people to keep, and bear arms, shall not be
     infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4. This may be considered as
     the true palladium of liberty.... The right of self defence is the
     ﬁrst law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of
     rulers to conﬁne this right within the narrowest limits possible.
     Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to
     keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever,
     prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of
     destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally,
     under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing
     lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure,
     under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True
     it is, their bill of rights seems at ﬁrst view to counteract this
     policy: but the right of bearing arms is conﬁned to protestants, and
     the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been
     interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other
     engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior
     tradesman, or other person not qualiﬁed to kill game. So that not
     one man in ﬁve hundred can keep a gun in his house without being
     subject to a penalty.^[127]

   In footnotes 40 and 41 of the Commentaries, Tucker stated that the
   right to bear arms under the Second Amendment was not subject to the
   restrictions that were part of English law: "The right of the people to
   keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art.
   4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree,
   as is the case in the British government" and "whoever examines the
   forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that
   the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of
   England." Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol.
   II, p. 412, "that the prevention of popular insurrections and
   resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a
   reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game
   laws."^[126] Blackstone discussed the right of self-defense in a
   separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes. Tucker's
   annotations for that latter section did not mention the Second
   Amendment but cited the standard works of English jurists such as
   Hawkins.^[128]

   Further, Tucker criticized the English Bill of Rights for limiting gun
   ownership to the very wealthy, leaving the populace effectively
   disarmed, and expressed the hope that Americans "never cease to regard
   the right of keeping and bearing arms as the surest pledge of their
   liberty."^[126]

William Rawle

   Tucker's commentary was soon followed, in 1825, by that of William
   Rawle in his landmark text, A View of the Constitution of the United
   States of America. Like Tucker, Rawle condemned England's "arbitrary
   code for the preservation of game," portraying that country as one that
   "boasts so much of its freedom," yet provides a right to "protestant
   subjects only" that it "cautiously describ[es] to be that of bearing
   arms for their defence" and reserves for "[a] very small proportion of
   the people[.]"^[129] In contrast, Rawle characterizes the second clause
   of the Second Amendment, which he calls the corollary clause, as a
   general prohibition against such capricious abuse of government power,
   declaring bluntly:

     No clause could by any rule of construction be conceived to give to
     congress a power to disarm the people. Such a flagitious attempt
     could only be made under some general pretence by a state
     legislature. But if in any blind pursuit of inordinate power, either
     should attempt it, this amendment may be appealed to as a restraint
     on both.^[130]

   Speaking of the Second Amendment generally, Rawle said:^[131]

     The prohibition is general. No clause in the Constitution could by
     any rule of construction be conceived to give to congress a power to
     disarm the people. Such a flagitious attempt could only be made
     under some general pretence by a state legislature. But if in any
     blind pursuit of inordinate power, either should attempt it, this
     amendment may be appealed to as a restraint on both.^[131]^[132]

   Rawle, long before the concept of incorporation was formally recognized
   by the courts, or Congress drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, contended
   that citizens could appeal to the Second Amendment should either the
   state or federal government attempt to disarm them. He did warn,
   however, that "this right [to bear arms] ought not...be abused to the
   disturbance of the public peace" and observed, paraphrasing Coke, that
   "[a]n assemblage of persons with arms, for unlawful purpose, is an
   indictable offence, and even the carrying of arms abroad by a single
   individual, attended with circumstances giving just reason to fear that
   he purposes to make an unlawful use of them, would be sufficient cause
   to require him to give surety of the peace."^[129]

Joseph Story

   Joseph Story articulated in his influential Commentaries on the
   Constitution^[133] the orthodox view of the Second Amendment, which he
   viewed as the amendment's clear meaning:

     The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been
     considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since
     it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary
     power of rulers; and it will generally, even if these are successful
     in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over
     them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the
     importance of a well-regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it
     cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a
     growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a
     strong disposition, from a sense of its burdens, to be rid of all
     regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed
     without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is
     certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust,
     and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the
     protection intended by this clause of our National Bill of
     Rights.^[134]^[135]

   Story describes a militia as the "natural defence of a free country,"
   both against foreign foes, domestic revolts and usurpation by rulers.
   The book regards the militia as a "moral check" against both usurpation
   and the arbitrary use of power, while expressing distress at the
   growing indifference of the American people to maintaining such an
   organized militia, which could lead to the undermining of the
   protection of the Second Amendment.^[135]

Lysander Spooner

   Abolitionist Lysander Spooner, commenting on bills of rights, stated
   that the object of all bills of rights is to assert the rights of
   individuals against the government and that the Second Amendment right
   to keep and bear arms was in support of the right to resist government
   oppression, as the only security against the tyranny of government lies
   in forcible resistance to injustice, for injustice will certainly be
   executed, unless forcibly resisted.^[136] Spooner's theory provided the
   intellectual foundation for John Brown and other radical abolitionists
   who believed that arming slaves was not only morally justified, but
   entirely consistent with the Second Amendment.^[137] An express
   connection between this right and the Second Amendment was drawn by
   Lysander Spooner who commented that a "right of resistance" is
   protected by both the right to trial by jury and the Second
   Amendment.^[138]

   The congressional debate on the proposed Fourteenth Amendment
   concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly
   freed slaves, including disarming the former slaves.^[139]

Timothy Farrar

   In 1867, Judge Timothy Farrar published his Manual of the Constitution
   of the United States of America, which was written when the Fourteenth
   Amendment was “in the process of adoption by the State
   legislatures.”:^[125]^[140]

     The States are recognized as governments, and, when their own
     constitutions permit, may do as they please; provided they do not
     interfere with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or
     with the civil or natural rights of the people recognized thereby,
     and held in conformity to them. The right of every person to "life,
     liberty, and property," to "keep and bear arms," to the "writ of
     habeas corpus" to "trial by jury," and divers others, are recognized
     by, and held under, the Constitution of the United States, and
     cannot be infringed by individuals or or even by the government
     itself.

Judge Thomas Cooley

   Judge Thomas Cooley, perhaps the most widely read constitutional
   scholar of the nineteenth century, wrote extensively about this
   amendment,^[141]^[142] and he explained in 1880 how the Second
   Amendment protected the "right of the people":^[143]

     It might be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the
     right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but
     this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent. The
     militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons
     who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty,
     and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the
     law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to
     perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly
     omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to
     those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated
     altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was
     meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is,
     that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the
     right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or
     regulation of law for the purpose.

Late 20th century commentary

   Assortment of modern handguns

   In the latter half of the 20th century there was considerable debate
   over whether the Second Amendment protected an individual right or a
   collective right.^[144] The debate centered on whether the prefatory
   clause (“A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
   free State”) declared the amendment’s only purpose or merely announced
   a purpose to introduce the operative clause (“the right of the People
   to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”).

   Three basic competing models were offered to interpret the Second
   Amendment:^[145]

   The first, known as the "states' rights" or "collective right" model,
   holds that the Second Amendment does not apply to individuals; rather,
   it recognizes the right of each state to arm its militia.

     Judicial reluctance to consider seriously whether the Fourteenth
     Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms from state
     infringement perhaps reflects a tendency to view the Second
     Amendment, with its apparent guarantee of gun ownership, as
     embarrassing and politically incorrect. Under the twentieth-century
     “State’s rights” view, “the people” have no right to keep or bear
     arms, but the states have a collective right to have the National
     Guard.^[125]

   The second, known as the "sophisticated collective right model", holds
   that the Second Amendment recognizes some limited individual right.
   However, this individual right could only be exercised by actively
   participating members of a functioning, organized state militia.

     Indeed, the fact that the collective right theory was once so
     confidently advanced by gun control enthusiasts is on its way down
     the collective memory hole as though it had never been asserted.
     With its demise, the intellectual debate over the original meaning
     of the second Amendment has turned in a different direction.
     Although now conceding that the right to keep and bear arms indeed
     belongs to individuals rather than to states, almost without missing
     a beat, gun control enthusiasts now claim with equal assurance that
     the individual right to bear arms was somehow "conditioned" in its
     exercise on participation in an organized militia.^[146]

   The third, known as the "standard model", is that the Second Amendment
   recognized the personal right of individuals to keep and bear arms.

     However, the weight of serious scholarship supports the historical
     intent of the Second Amendment to protect individual rights and to
     deter governmental tyranny. From the Federalist Papers to
     explanations when the Bill of Rights was introduced, it is clear
     that the purpose of the Second Amendment was to protect individual
     rights.^[125]

   Under both of the collective right models, the opening phrase was
   considered essential as a pre-condition for the main clause.^[147]
   These interpretations held that this was a grammar structure that was
   common during that era^[148] and that this grammar dictated that the
   Second Amendment protected a collective right to firearms to the extent
   necessary for militia duty.^[149]

   Under the standard model, the opening phrase is believed to be
   prefatory or amplifying to the operative clause. The opening phrase was
   meant as a non-exclusive example—one of many reasons for the
   amendment.^[42] This interpretation is consistent with the position
   that the Second Amendment protects a modified individual right.^[150]

   The question of a collective right versus an individual right was
   progressively resolved with the Fifth Circuit ruling in United States
   v. Emerson (2001), along with the Supreme Court's rulings in District
   of Columbia v. Heller (2008), and McDonald v. Chicago (2010). These
   rulings upheld the individual rights model when interpreting the Second
   Amendment. In Heller, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment
   protects an individual right.^[151] Although the Second Amendment is
   the only Constitutional amendment with a prefatory clause, such
   constructions were widely used elsewhere.^[152]

Meaning of "well regulated militia"

   The term "regulated" means "disciplined" or "trained".^[153] In Heller,
   the U.S. Supreme Court stated that "[t]he adjective 'well-regulated'
   implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and
   training."^[154]

   In the year prior to the drafting of the Second Amendment, in
   Federalist No. 29 Alexander Hamilton wrote the following about
   "organizing", "disciplining", "arming", and "training" of the militia
   as specified in the enumerated powers:

     If a well regulated militia be the most natural defence of a free
     country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the
     disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the
     national security...confiding the regulation of the militia to the
     direction of the national authority...[but] reserving to the
     states...the authority of training the militia....A tolerable
     expertness in military movements is a business that requires time
     and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for
     the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and
     of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the
     purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often
     as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which
     would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia,
     would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public
     inconvenience and loss.... Little more can reasonably be aimed at,
     with respect to the People at large, than to have them properly
     armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected,
     it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
     a year.^[73]

   Justice Scalia, writing for the Court in Heller : "In Nunn v. State, 1
   Ga. 243, 251 (1846), the Georgia Supreme Court construed the Second
   Amendment as protecting the 'natural right of self-defence' and
   therefore struck down a ban on carrying pistols openly. Its opinion
   perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second
   Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory clause, in
   continuity with the English right":

     Nor is the right involved in this discussion less comprehensive or
     valuable: "The right of the people to bear arms shall not be
     infringed." The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women
     and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every
     description, not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not
     be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree;
     and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up
     and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the
     security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or
     Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which
     contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers,
     trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and
     successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to
     this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated
     conspicuously in our own Magna Charta! And Lexington, Concord,
     Camden, River Raisin, Sandusky, and the laurel-crowned field of New
     Orleans, plead eloquently for this interpretation! And the
     acquisition of Texas may be considered the full fruits of this great
     constitutional right.^[155]

   Justice Stevens in dissent:

     When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is
     most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and
     possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated
     militia. So far as appears, no more than that was contemplated by
     its drafters or is encompassed within its terms. Even if the meaning
     of the text were genuinely susceptible to more than one
     interpretation, the burden would remain on those advocating a
     departure from the purpose identified in the preamble and from
     settled law to come forward with persuasive new arguments or
     evidence. The textual analysis offered by respondent and embraced by
     the Court falls far short of sustaining that heavy burden. And the
     Court’s emphatic reliance on the claim “that the Second Amendment …
     codified a pre-existing right,” ante, at 19 [refers to page 19 of
     the opinion], is of course beside the point because the right to
     keep and bear arms for service in a state militia was also a
     pre-existing right.^[156]

Meaning of "the right of the People"

   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in Heller, stated:

     Nowhere else in the Constitution does a “right” attributed to “the
     people” refer to anything other than an individual right. What is
     more, in all six other provisions of the Constitution that mention
     “the people,” the term unambiguously refers to all members of the
     political community, not an unspecified subset. This contrasts
     markedly with the phrase “the militia” in the prefatory clause. As
     we will describe below, the “militia” in colonial America consisted
     of a subset of “the people”— those who were male, able bodied, and
     within a certain age range. Reading the Second Amendment as
     protecting only the right to “keep and bear Arms” in an organized
     militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause’s
     description of the holder of that right as “the people”.^[157]

   An earlier case, United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990), dealt with
   nonresident aliens and the Fourth Amendment, but led to a discussion of
   who are "the People" when referred to elsewhere in the
   Constitution:^[158]

     The Second Amendment protects "the right of the people to keep and
     bear Arms," and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain
     rights and powers are retained by and reserved to "the people." ...
     While this textual exegesis is by no means conclusive, it suggests
     that "the people" protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the
     First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are
     reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of
     persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise
     developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered
     part of that community.

   There were several different reasons for this amendment, and protecting
   militias was only one of them; if protecting militias had been the only
   reason then the amendment could have instead referred to “the right of
   the militia to keep and bear arms” instead of “the right of the people
   to keep and bear arms”.^[159]^[160]

Meaning of "keep and bear arms"

   In Heller the majority rejected the view that the term "to bear arms"
   implies only the military use of arms:

     Before addressing the verbs “keep” and “bear,” we interpret their
     object: “Arms.” The term was applied, then as now, to weapons that
     were not specifically designed for military use and were not
     employed in a military capacity. Thus, the most natural reading of
     “keep Arms” in the Second Amendment is to “have weapons.” At the
     time of the founding, as now, to “bear” meant to “carry.” In
     numerous instances, “bear arms” was unambiguously used to refer to
     the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state
     constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first
     two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens “bear
     arms in defense of themselves and the state” again, in the most
     analogous linguistic context—that “bear arms” was not limited to the
     carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase “bear Arms” also had at
     the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly
     different from its natural meaning: “to serve as a soldier, do
     military service, fight” or “to wage war.” But it unequivocally bore
     that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition
     “against,”. Every example given by petitioners’ amici for the
     idiomatic meaning of “bear arms” from the founding period either
     includes the preposition “against” or is not clearly idiomatic. In
     any event, the meaning of “bear arms” that petitioners and Justice
     Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning.
     Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby “bear arms”
     connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an
     idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No
     dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been
     apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at
     the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase “keep and bear
     Arms” would be incoherent. The word “Arms” would have two different
     meanings at once: “weapons” (as the object of “keep”) and (as the
     object of “bear”) one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like
     saying “He filled and kicked the bucket” to mean “He filled the
     bucket and died.”^[157]

   In a dissent, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, Justice
   Stevens said:

     The Amendment's text does justify a different limitation: the "right
     to keep and bear arms" protects only a right to possess and use
     firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia.
     Had the Framers wished to expand the meaning of the phrase "bear
     arms" to encompass civilian possession and use, they could have done
     so by the addition of phrases such as "for the defense of
     themselves".^[161]

Supreme Court cases

   U.S. Supreme Court
   See also: Firearm case law in the United States

   In the century following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the
   intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less
   interest than it does in modern times.^[162] The vast majority of
   regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons
   regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A
   notable exception to this general rule was Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. 1
   (1820), where the U.S. Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in
   an aside.^[163] In the Dred Scott decision, the opinion of the court
   stated that if African Americans were considered U.S. citizens, "It
   would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as
   citizens in any one State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry
   arms wherever they went."^[164]

   State and federal courts historically have used two models to interpret
   the Second Amendment: the "individual rights" model, which holds that
   individuals hold the right to bear arms, and the "collective rights"
   model, which holds that the right is dependent on militia membership.
   The "collective rights" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court,
   in favor of the individual rights model.

   The Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include United
   States v. Miller, (1939); District of Columbia v. Heller (2008); and
   McDonald v. Chicago (2010).

   Heller and McDonald supported the individual rights model, under which
   the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as
   the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this
   model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and
   ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which
   militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in Miller
   said:

     The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the
     debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies
     and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show
     plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically
     capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of
     citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that
     ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear
     bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at
     the time.^[165]

   Of the collective rights model that holds that the right to arms is
   based on militia membership, the Supreme Court in Heller said:

     A purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it
     modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass (except,
     apparently, in some courses on Linguistics). If “bear arms” means,
     as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the
     purpose of the carriage (“for the purpose of self-defense” or “to
     make war against the King”). But if “bear arms” means, as the
     petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for
     military purposes, one simply cannot add “for the purpose of killing
     game.” The right “to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of
     killing game” is worthy of the mad hatter.^[166]

United States v. Cruikshank

   Main article: United States v. Cruikshank

   In the Reconstruction Era case of United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S.
   542 (1875), the defendants were white men who had killed more than
   sixty black people in what was known as the Colfax massacre and had
   been charged with conspiring to prevent blacks from exercising their
   right to bear arms. The Court dismissed the charges, holding that the
   Bill of Rights restricted Congress but not private individuals. The
   Court concluded, "[f]or their protection in its enjoyment, the people
   must look to the States."^[167]

   The Court stated that "[t]he Second Amendment...has no other effect
   than to restrict the powers of the national government...."^[168]
   Likewise, the Court held that there was no state action in this case,
   and therefore the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable:

     The fourteenth amendment prohibits a State from depriving any person
     of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; but this
     adds nothing to the rights of one citizen as against another.^[169]

   Thus, the Court held a federal anti-Ku-Klux-Klan statute to be
   unconstitutional as applied in that case.^[170]

Presser v. Illinois

   Main article: Presser v. Illinois

   In Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886), Herman Presser headed a
   German-American paramilitary shooting organization and was arrested for
   leading a parade group of 400 men, training and drilling with military
   weapons with the declared intention to fight, through the streets of
   Chicago as a violation of Illinois law that prohibited public drilling
   and parading in military style without a permit from the
   governor.^[171]^[172]

   At his trial, Presser argued that the State of Illinois had violated
   his Second Amendment rights. The Supreme Court reaffirmed Cruikshank,
   and also held that the Second Amendment prevented neither the States
   nor Congress from barring private militias that parade with arms; such
   a right "cannot be claimed as a right independent of law." This
   decision upheld the States' authority to regulate the militia and that
   citizens had no right to create their own militias or to own weapons
   for semi-military purposes.^[171] However the court said: "A state
   cannot prohibit the people therein from keeping and bearing arms to an
   extent that would deprive the United States of the protection afforded
   by them as a reserve military force."^[173]

Miller v. Texas

   In Miller v. Texas, 153 U.S. 535 (1894), Franklin Miller was convicted
   and sentenced to be executed for shooting a police officer to death
   with an illegally carried handgun in violation of Texas law. Miller
   sought to have his conviction overturned, claiming his Second Amendment
   rights were violated and that the Bill of Rights should be applied to
   state law. The Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not
   apply to state laws such as the Texas law:^[174] "As the proceedings
   were conducted under the ordinary forms of criminal prosecutions there
   certainly was no denial of due process of law."^[175]

Robertson v. Baldwin

   In Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275 (1897), the Court stated in dicta
   that laws regulating concealed arms did not infringe upon the right to
   keep and bear arms and thus were not a violation of the Second
   Amendment:

     The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten amendments to
     the Constitution, commonly known as the "Bill of Rights," were not
     intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply
     to embody certain guaranties and immunities which we had inherited
     from our English ancestors, and which had, from time immemorial,
     been subject to certain well recognized exceptions arising from the
     necessities of the case. In incorporating these principles into the
     fundamental law, there was no intention of disregarding the
     exceptions, which continued to be recognized as if they had been
     formally expressed. Thus, the freedom of speech and of the press
     (Art. I) does not permit the publication of libels, blasphemous or
     indecent articles, or other publications injurious to public morals
     or private reputation; the right of the people to keep and bear arms
     (Art. II) is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of
     concealed weapons.^[176]

United States v. Miller

   Main article: United States v. Miller

   In United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), the Supreme Court
   rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act
   prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered Title II
   weapons:

     Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did unlawfully...transport in
     interstate commerce from...Claremore...Oklahoma to...Siloam
     Springs...Arkansas a certain firearm...a double barrel...shotgun
     having a barrel less than 18 inches in length...at the time of so
     transporting said firearm in interstate commerce...not having
     registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26,
     United States Code, ...and not having in their possession a
     stamp-affixed written order...as provided by Section 1132C..."^[177]

   In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice McReynolds, the Supreme
   Court stated "the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved
   to the States is plainly untenable."^[178] As the Court explained:

     In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or
     use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in
     length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any
     preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot
     say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear
     such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that
     this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that
     its use could contribute to the common defense.^[179]

   Gun rights advocates claim that the Court in Miller ruled that the
   Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of
   "ordinary military equipment."^[180] They also claim that the Court did
   not consider the question of whether the sawed-off shotgun in the case
   would be an applicable weapon for personal defense, instead looking
   solely at the weapon's suitability for the "common defense."^[181] Law
   professor Andrew McClurg states, "The only certainty about Miller is
   that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern
   scholars recognize this fact."^[182]

District of Columbia v. Heller

   Main article: District of Columbia v. Heller

Judgment

   The Justices who decided Heller

   According to the syllabus prepared by the U.S. Supreme Court Reporter
   of Decisions,^[183] in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570
   (2008), the Supreme Court held:^[183]^[184]

          1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess
          a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that
          arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense
          within the home. Pp. 2–53.^[183]^[184]

                (a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose,
                but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part,
                the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and
                history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right
                to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22.^[183]^[184]
                (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s
                interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia”
                comprised all males physically capable of acting in
                concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared
                that the Federal Government would disarm the people in
                order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a
                politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The
                response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient
                right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the
                ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved.
                Pp. 22–28.^[183]^[184]
                (c) The Court’s interpretation is confirmed by analogous
                arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded
                and immediately followed the Second Amendment.
                Pp. 28–30.^[183]^[184]
                (d) The Second Amendment’s drafting history, while of
                dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second
                Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an
                individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30–32.^[183]^[184]
                (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars,
                courts and legislators, from immediately after its
                ratification through the late 19th century also supports
                the Court’s conclusion. Pp. 32–47.^[183]^[184]
                (f) None of the Court’s precedents forecloses the Court’s
                interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.
                S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, refutes
                the individual-rights interpretation. United States v.
                Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep
                and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the
                type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by
                the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful
                purposes. Pp. 47–54.^[183]^[184]

          2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not
          unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon
          whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose:
          For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld
          under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion
          should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions
          on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or
          laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places
          such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing
          conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.
          Miller's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those
          "in common use at the time" finds support in the historical
          tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual
          weapons. Pp. 54–56.^[183]^[184]
          3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied
          to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District’s
          total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a
          prohibition on an entire class of "arms" that Americans
          overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense.
          Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to
          enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition—in the place
          where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and
          property is most acute—would fail constitutional muster.
          Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home
          be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible
          for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of
          self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller
          conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is
          permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously,
          the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for
          relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming
          he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights,
          the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must
          issue him a license to carry it in the home. Pp. 56–64.^[184]

   There are similar legal summaries of the Supreme Court's findings in
   Heller.^[185]^[186]^[187]^[188]^[189]^[190] For example, the Illinois
   Supreme Court in People v. Aguilar (2013), summed up Heller's findings
   and reasoning:

     In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme
     Court undertook its first-ever “in-depth examination” of the second
     amendment’s meaning Id. at 635. After a lengthy historical
     discussion, the Court ultimately concluded that the second amendment
     “guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in
     case of confrontation” (id. at 592); that “central to” this right is
     “the inherent right of self-defense”(id. at 628); that “the home” is
     “where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most
     acute” (id. at 628); and that, “above all other interests,” the
     second amendment elevates “the right of law abiding, responsible
     citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home” (id. at 635).
     Based on this understanding, the Court held that a District of
     Columbia law banning handgun possession in the home violated the
     second amendment. Id. at 635.^[191]

Notes and analysis

   Heller has been widely described as a landmark
   decision.^[192]^[193]^[194]^[195]^[196] To clarify that its ruling does
   not invalidate a broad range of existing firearm laws, the majority
   opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said:^[197]

     Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not
     unlimited....Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical
     analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in
     our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding
     prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the
     mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in
     sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws
     imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of
     arms.^[198]

   The Court's statement that the right is limited has been widely
   discussed by lower courts and the media.^[199]^[200]^[201]^[202]^[203]
   The majority opinion also said that the amendment's prefatory clause
   (referencing the "militia") serves to clarify the operative clause
   (referencing "the people"), but does not limit the scope of the
   operative clause, because "the 'militia' in colonial America consisted
   of a subset of 'the people'...."^[204]

   Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion, which was joined by the three
   other dissenters, said:

     The question presented by this case is not whether the Second
     Amendment protects a "collective right" or an "individual right."
     Surely it protects a right that can be enforced by individuals. But
     a conclusion that the Second Amendment protects an individual right
     does not tell us anything about the scope of that right.^[205]

   This dissent called the majority opinion "strained and unpersuasive"
   and said that the right to possess a firearm exists only in relation to
   the militia and that the D.C. laws constitute permissible regulation.
   In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens' interpretation of the phrase
   "to keep and bear arms" was referred to as a "hybrid" definition that
   Stevens purportedly chose in order to avoid an "incoherent" and
   "[g]rotesque" idiomatic meeting.^[206]

   Justice Breyer, in his own dissent joined by Stevens, Souter, and
   Ginsburg, stated that the entire Court subscribes to the proposition
   that "the amendment protects an 'individual' right—i.e., one that is
   separately possessed, and may be separately enforced, by each person on
   whom it is conferred".^[207]

   Regarding the term "well regulated", the majority opinion said, "The
   adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of
   proper discipline and training."^[154] The majority opinion quoted
   Spooner from The Unconstitutionality of Slavery as saying that the
   right to bear arms was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand
   against slavery.^[208] The majority opinion also stated that:

     A purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it
     modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass (except,
     apparently, in some courses on Linguistics). If "bear arms" means,
     as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the
     purpose of the carriage ("for the purpose of self-defense" or "to
     make war against the King"). But if "bear arms" means, as the
     petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for
     military purposes, one simply cannot add "for the purpose of killing
     game." The right "to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of
     killing game" is worthy of the mad hatter.^[209]

   The dissenting justices were not persuaded by this argument.^[210]

   Reaction to Heller has varied, with many sources giving focus to the
   ruling referring to itself as being the first in Supreme Court history
   to read the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right. The
   majority opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, gives explanation of the
   majority legal reasoning behind this decision.^[184] The majority
   opinion made clear that the recent ruling did not foreclose the Court’s
   prior interpretations given in United States v. Cruikshank, Presser v.
   Illinois, and United States v. Miller though these earlier rulings did
   not limit the right to keep and bear arms solely to militia purposes,
   but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to
   those used by the militia (i.e., those in common use for lawful
   purposes).^[184]

   Heller pertained to three District of Columbia ordinances involving
   restrictions on firearms amounting to a total ban. These three
   ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all
   firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and
   licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in
   the home, such as from one room to another.

     Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to
     enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition—in the place
     where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and
     property is most acute—would fail constitutional muster.... Because
     Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law
     is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously,
     the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief
     and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not
     disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District
     must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a
     license to carry it in the home."^[184]

McDonald v. Chicago

   Main article: McDonald v. Chicago

   On June 28, 2010, the Court in McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 3025
   (2010) held that the Second Amendment was incorporated. This means that
   the Court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local
   governments to the same extent that it limits the federal
   government.^[14] It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun
   prohibition. Four of the five Justices in the majority voted to do so
   by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while the
   fifth Justice, Clarence Thomas, voted to do so through the amendment's
   Privileges or Immunities Clause.^[211]

   Justice Thomas noted that the Privileges or Immunities Clause refers to
   "citizens" whereas the Due Process Clause refers more broadly to any
   "person", and therefore Thomas reserved the issue of non-citizens for
   later decision.^[212] After McDonald, many questions about the Second
   Amendment remain unsettled, such as whether non-citizens are protected
   through the Equal Protection Clause.^[212]

   In People v. Aguilar (2013), the Illinois Supreme Court summed up the
   central Second Amendment findings in McDonald:

     Two years later, in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. ___, ___,
     130 S. Ct. 3020, 3050 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the second
     amendment right recognized in Heller is applicable to the states
     through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. In so
     holding, the Court reiterated that “the Second Amendment protects
     the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense”
     (id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3026); that “individual self-defense is
     ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right” (emphasis in
     original) (id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3036 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S.
     at 599)); and that “[s]elf-defense is a basic right, recognized by
     many legal systems from ancient times to the present day” (id. at
     ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3036).^[191]

United States Courts of Appeals decisions before and after Heller

Before Heller

   Until District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), United States v. Miller
   (1939) had been the only Supreme Court decision that "tested a
   congressional enactment against [the Second Amendment]."^[11] Miller
   did not directly mention either a collective or individual right, but
   for the 62-year period from Miller until the Fifth Circuit's decision
   in United States v. Emerson (2001), federal courts recognized only the
   collective right,^[213] with "courts increasingly referring to one
   another's holdings...without engaging in any appreciably substantive
   legal analysis of the issue".^[11]

   Emerson changed this by addressing the question in depth, with the
   Fifth Circuit determining that the Second Amendment protects an
   individual right.^[11] Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit conflicted with
   Emerson in Silviera v. Lockyer, and the D.C. Circuit supported Emerson
   in Parker v. District of Columbia.^[11] Parker evolved into District of
   Columbia v. Heller, in which the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the
   Second Amendment protects an individual right.

After Heller

   Since Heller, the United States courts of appeals have ruled on many
   Second Amendment challenges to convictions and gun control
   laws.^[214]^[215] The following are post-Heller cases, divided by
   Circuit, along with summary notes:

   D.C. Circuit
     * Heller v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 08-1289 (RMU), No.
       23., 25 On March 26, 2010, the D.C. Circuit denied the follow up
       appeal of Dick Heller who requested the court to overturn the new
       District of Columbia gun control ordinances newly enacted after the
       2008 Heller ruling. The court refused to do so, stating that the
       firearms registration procedures; the prohibition on assault
       weapons; and the prohibition on large capacity ammunition feeding
       devices were found to not violate the Second Amendment.^[216]

   First Circuit
     * United States v. Rene E., 583 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2009) – On August
       31, 2009, the First Circuit affirmed the conviction of a juvenile
       for the illegal possession of a handgun as a juvenile, under 18
       U.S.C. § 922(x)(2)(A) and 18 U.S.C. § 5032, rejecting the
       defendant's argument that the federal law violated his Second
       Amendment rights under Heller. The court cited "the existence of a
       longstanding tradition of prohibiting juveniles from both receiving
       and possessing handguns" and observed "the federal ban on juvenile
       possession of handguns is part of a longstanding practice of
       prohibiting certain classes of individuals from possessing firearms
       — those whose possession poses a particular danger to the
       public."^[217]

   Second Circuit
     * Kachalsky v. County of Westchester, 11-3942 – On November 28, 2012,
       the Second Circuit upheld New York's may-issue concealed carry
       permit law, ruling that "the proper cause requirement is
       substantially related to New York's compelling interests in public
       safety and crime prevention."^[218]

   Fourth Circuit
     * United States v. Hall, 551 F.3d 257 (4th Cir. 2009) – On August 4,
       2008, the Fourth Circuit upheld as constitutional the prohibition
       of possession of a concealed weapon without a permit.^[219]

     * United States v. Chester, 628 F.3d 673 (4th Cir. 2010) – On
       December 30, 2010, the Fourth Circuit vacated William Chester's
       conviction for possession of a firearm after having been convicted
       of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, in violation of 18
       U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).^[220] The court found that the district court
       erred in perfunctorily relying on Heller's exception for
       "presumptively lawful" gun regulations made in accordance with
       "longstanding prohibitions".^[221]

   Fifth Circuit
     * United States v. Dorosan, 350 Fed. Appx. 874 (5th Cir. 2009) – On
       June 30, 2008, the Fifth Circuit upheld 39 C.F.R. 232.1(l), which
       bans weapons on postal property, sustaining restrictions on guns
       outside the home, specifically in private vehicles parked in
       employee parking lots of government facilities, despite Second
       Amendment claims that were dismissed. The employee's Second
       Amendment rights were not infringed since the employee could have
       instead parked across the street in a public parking lot, instead
       of on government property.^[222]^[223]

     * United States v. Bledsoe, 334 Fed. Appx. 771 (5th Cir. 2009) – The
       Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision of a U.S. District Court
       decision in Texas, upholding 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6), which prohibits
       "straw purchases." A "straw purchase" occurs when someone eligible
       to purchase a firearm buys one for an ineligible person.
       Additionally, the court rejected the request for a strict scrutiny
       standard of review.^[219]

     * United States v. Scroggins, 551 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2010) – On March
       4, 2010, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction of Ernie
       Scroggins for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, in
       violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The court noted that it had,
       prior to Heller, identified the Second Amendment as providing an
       individual right to bear arms, and had already, likewise,
       determined that restrictions on felon ownership of firearms did not
       violate this right. Moreover, it observed that Heller did not
       affect the longstanding prohibition of firearm possession by
       felons.

   Seventh Circuit
     * United States v. Skoien, 587 F.3d 803 (7th Cir. 2009) – Steven
       Skoien, a Wisconsin man convicted of two misdemeanor domestic
       violence convictions, appealed his conviction based on the argument
       that the prohibition violated the individual rights to bear arms,
       as described in Heller. After initial favorable rulings in lower
       court based on a standard of intermediate scrutiny,^[224] on July
       13, 2010, the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, ruled 10–1 against
       Skoien and reinstated his conviction for a gun violation, citing
       the strong relation between the law in question and the government
       objective.^[224] Skoien was convicted and sentenced to two years in
       prison for the gun violation, and will thus likely be subject to a
       lifetime ban on gun ownership.^[225]^[226] Editorials favoring gun
       rights sharply criticized this ruling as going too far with the
       enactment of a lifetime gun ban,^[227] while editorials favoring
       gun regulations praised the ruling as "a bucket of cold water
       thrown on the 'gun rights' celebration".^[228]

     * Moore v. Madigan (Circuit docket 12-1269)^[229] – On December 11,
       2012, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the Second Amendment protected
       a right to keep and bear arms in public for self-defense. This was
       an expansion of the Supreme Court's decisions in Heller and
       McDonald, each of which referred only to such a right in the home.
       Based on this ruling, the court declared Illinois's ban on the
       concealed carrying of firearms to be unconstitutional. The court
       stayed this ruling for 180 days, so Illinois could enact
       replacement legislation.^[230]^[231]^[232] On February 22, 2013, a
       petition for rehearing en banc was denied by a vote of 5-4.^[233]
       On July 9, 2013, the Illinois General Assembly, overriding Governor
       Quinn's veto, passed a law permitting the concealed carrying of
       firearms.^[234]

   Ninth Circuit
     * Nordyke v. King, 2012 WL 1959239 (9th Cir. 2012) – On July 29,
       2009, the Ninth Circuit vacated an April 20 panel decision and
       reheard the case en banc on September 24,
       2009.^[235]^[236]^[237]^[238] The April 20 decision had held that
       the Second Amendment applies to state and local governments, while
       upholding an Alameda County, California ordinance that makes it a
       crime to bring a gun or ammunition on to, or possess either while
       on, county property.^[239]^[240] The en banc panel remanded the
       case to the three-judge panel. On May 2, 2011, that panel ruled
       that intermediate scrutiny was the correct standard by which to
       judge the ordinance's constitutionality and remanded the case to
       the United States District Court for the Northern District of
       California.^[241] On November 28, 2011, the Ninth Circuit vacated
       the panel's May 2 decision and agreed to rehear the case en
       banc.^[242]^[243] On April 4, 2012, the panel sent the case to
       mediation.^[244] The panel dismissed the case on June 1, 2012, but
       only after Alameda County officials changed their interpretation of
       the challenged ordinance. Under the new interpretation, gun shows
       may take place on county property under the ordinance's exception
       for "events", subject to restrictions regarding the display and
       handling of firearms.^[245]

   37. ^ "This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background
       of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been
       widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and
       Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of
       the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the
       right and declares only that it “shall not be infringed.” As we
       (the United States Supreme Court) said in United States v.
       Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 553 (1876), “[t]his is not a right
       granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent
       upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment
       declares that it shall not be infringed ..”. Between the
       Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles
       II and James II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to
       suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their
       opponents. See J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms 31–53 (1994)
       (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, The Declaration of Rights,
       1689, p. 76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for
       example, the Catholic James II had ordered general disarmaments of
       regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103–106. These
       experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated
       military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms.
       They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in
       the Declaration of Right (which was codified as the English Bill of
       Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: “That the
       subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense
       suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.” 1 W. & M., c.
       2, §7, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689). This right has long
       been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment. See
       E. Dumbauld, The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today 51 (1957);
       W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of
       America 122 (1825) (hereinafter Rawle)." From the Opinion of the

   38. ^ Justice Antonin Scalia, wrote that "the right of the people to
       keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed" was a just a
       controlling one and referred to it as a pre-existing right of
       individuals to possess and carry personal weapons for self-defense
       and intrinsically for defense against tyranny. As with the English
       law "like most rights, the Second Amendment is not unlimited. It is
       not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
       whatsoever and for whatever purpose." District of Columbia v Heller
   39. ^ "Where a later enactment does not expressly repeal an earlier
       enactment which it has power to override, but the provisions of the
       later enactment are contrary to those of the earlier, the latter by
       implication repeals the earlier." R v. Burke, [1998] EWHC Admin
       913; "[T]he Bill of Rights...was declaratory of the common law. It
       contained in it its own words of limitation, namely that the right
       to have arms for self-defence is limited by the words 'and as
       allowed by Law'. The law is a changing thing. Parliament by statute
       can repeal the common law...Where the Bill of Rights says that 'the
       Subjects may have arms for their defence suitable for their
       condition and as allowed by law', 'and as allowed by law' means

       from which few will dissent. Although in actual war, the services
       of regular troops are confessedly more valuable; yet, while peace
       prevails, and in the commencement of a war before a regular force
       can be raised, the militia form the palladium of the country. They
       are ready to repel invasion, to suppress insurrection, and preserve
       the good order and peace of government. That they should be well
       regulated, is judiciously added. A disorderly militia is
       disgraceful to itself, and dangerous not to the enemy, but to its
       own country. The duty of the state government is, to adopt such
       regulations as will tend to make good soldiers with the least
       interruptions of the ordinary and useful occupations of civil life.
       In this all the Union has a strong and visible interest. The

       militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right
       of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' One of
       the ordinary modes, by which tyrants accomplish their purposes
       without resistance, is, by disarming the people, and making it an
       offence to keep arms, and by substituting a regular army in the
       stead of a resort to the militia. The friends of a free government
       cannot be too watchful, to overcome the dangerous tendency of the
       public mind to sacrifice, for the sake of mere private convenience,
       this powerful check upon the designs of ambitious men. § 451. The
       importance of this article will scarcely be doubted by any persons,
       who have duly reflected upon the subject. The militia is the
       natural defence of a free country against sudden foreign invasions,
       domestic insurrections, and domestic usurpations of power by
       rulers. It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up
       large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace,
       both from the enormous expenses, with which they are attended, and
       the facile means, which they afford to ambitious and unprincipled
       rulers, to subvert the government, or trample upon the rights of
       the people. The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has
       justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a
       republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the
       usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and it will generally,
       even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the
       people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth
       would seem so clear, and the importance of a well-regulated militia
       would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the
       American people there is a growing indifference to any system of
       militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of its
       burdens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to
       keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is
       difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that
       indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus
       gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of
       our National Bill of Rights."

       people of the United States, in making their Constitution, do not
       create or confer on themselves any new rights, but they expressly
       reserve all the rights they then held, except what were delegated
       for their own benefit; and they particularly and expressly
       recognize and perpetuate many natural and civil common-law rights,
       which, of course, are placed beyond the reach of any subordinate
       government, and even of their own. Among these are the following :
       1. The right to be, what they call themselves, 'the people of the
       United States,' citizens, and component members of the body
       politic, — the nation; and to participate in all the privileges,
       immunities, and benefits the Constitution was designed to obtain or
       secure for all the American people, especially the right to be
       protected and governed according to the provisions of the
       Constitution. 2. A right to the privileges and immunities of
       citizens in any of the several States. Among these is the
       fundamental and elementary right of suffrage. The Representatives
       to the national and State legislatures must be chosen by the
       people, the citizens (Section 2). Consequently, the citizens must
       choose them, and have a right to choose them. Am. 14, § 2. 3. A
       right to the common-law writ of habeas corpus, to protect the other
       common-law right, as well as natural and constitutional right, of
       personal liberty. 4. A right to trial by jury in any criminal case.
       5. A right to keep and bear arms. 6. A right to life, liberty, and
       property, unless deprived by due process of law. 7. A right to just
       compensation for private property legally taken for public use. 8.
       A right to participate in all rights retained by, or reserved to,
       the people. Most of these rights, with many others, belong by the
       Constitution not only to the citizens, — the people of the United
       States, strictly so called, by reason of the franchise of natural
       birth or otherwise, — but also to all persons who may be allowed to
       be and remain under the jurisdiction and protection of our
       government. These are a part only of the rights held by every
       member of the nation, under and by virtue of the Constitution of
       the United States, independent of any other earthly power, and
       which, of course, 'cannot be destroyed or abridged by the laws of
       any particular State.' Who, then, in the United States is destitute
       of rights?...The States are recognized as governments, and, when
       their own constitutions permit, may do as they please; provided
       they do not interfere with the Constitution and laws of the United
       States, or with the civil or natural rights of the people
       recognized thereby, and held in conformity to them. The right of
       every person to 'life, liberty, and property,' to 'keep and bear
       arms,' to the 'writ of habeas corpus' to 'trial by jury,' and
       divers others, are recognized by, and held under, the Constitution
       of the United States, and cannot be infringed by individuals or or
       even by the government itself."

       Princeton Review 213–14 (1883): "The right of the people to bear
       arms in their own defence, and to form and drill military
       organizations in defence of the State,… is reserved by the people
       as a possible and necessary resort for the protection of
       self-government against usurpation, and against any attempt on the
       part of those who may for the time be in possession of State
       authority or resources to set aside the constitution and substitute
       their own rule for that of the people. Should the contingency ever
       arise when it would be necessary for the people to make use of the
       arms in their hands for the protection of constitutional liberty,
       the proceeding, so far from being revolutionary, would be in strict
       accord with popular right and duty."

       to liberty should be mentioned the right of the people to keep and
       bear arms.1 A standing army is peculiarly obnoxious in any free
       government, and the jealousy of such an army has at times been so
       strongly demonstrated in England as to lead to the belief that even
       though recruited from among themselves, it was more dreaded by the
       people as an instrument of oppression than a tyrannical monarch or
       any foreign power. So impatient did the English people become of
       the very army that liberated them from the tyranny of James II.
       that they demanded its reduction even before the liberation became
       complete ; and to this day the British Parliament render a standing
       army practically impossible by only passing a mutiny act from
       session to session. The alternative to a standing army is " a
       well-regulated militia ; " but this cannot exist unless the people
       are trained to bearing arms. The federal and State constitutions
       therefore provide that the right of the people to bear arms shall
       not be infringed ; but how far it may be in the power of the
       legislature to regulate the right we shall not undertake to say, as
       happily there neither has been, nor perhaps is likely to be, much
       occasion for a discussion of that question by the courts."
