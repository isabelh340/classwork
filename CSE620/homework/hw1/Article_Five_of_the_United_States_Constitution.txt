   Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the process
   whereby the Constitution may be altered. Altering the Constitution
   consists of proposing an amendment or amendments and subsequent
   ratification.^[1]

   Amendments may be adopted and sent to the states for ratification by
   either:
     * Two-thirds (supermajority) of both the Senate and the House of
       Representatives of the United States Congress;

   OR
     * By a national convention assembled at the request of the
       legislatures of at least two-thirds (at present 34) of the states.

   To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by
   either (as determined by Congress):
     * The legislatures of three-fourths (at present 38) of the states;

   OR
     * State ratifying conventions in three-fourths (at present 38) of the
       states.

Text[edit]

     The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it
     necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the
     application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states,
     shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either
     case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this
     Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of
     the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as
     the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the
     Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the
     year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect
     the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first
     article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived
     of its equal suffrage in the Senate. ^[2]

Procedure for amending the Constitution[edit]

   The U.S. constitutional amendment process.

   Thirty-three amendments to the United States Constitution have been
   approved by the United States Congress and sent to the states for
   ratification. Twenty-seven of these amendments have been ratified and
   are now part of the Constitution. The first ten amendments were adopted
   and ratified simultaneously and are known collectively as the Bill of
   Rights. Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have
   not been ratified by the required number of states and are not part of
   the Constitution. Four of these amendments are still technically open
   and pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is
   closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it
   (though this is in dispute). There have been many other proposals for
   amendments to the United States Constitution. Approximately 11,539
   measures have been introduced in Congress since 1789,^[3] only to die
   in committee or on the floor of the House or Senate, and were therefore
   not sent to the states for ratification.

Proposing amendments[edit]

   Resolution proposing the Nineteenth Amendment

   Whenever they "shall deem it necessary", two-thirds of both houses of
   Congress may "propose amendments". This means two-thirds of those
   members present—assuming that a quorum exists at the time that the vote
   is cast—and not necessarily a two-thirds vote of the entire membership
   elected and serving in the two houses of Congress.^[4] It was suggested
   that the two houses first adopt a resolution indicating that they deem
   an amendment necessary, but this procedure has never been used—the U.S.
   Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives instead directly proceed
   to the adoption of a joint resolution, thereby proposing the amendment
   with the implication that both bodies deem the amendment to be
   "necessary". Up to now, all amendments have been proposed and
   implemented as codicils appended to the main body of the Constitution.

   If at least two-thirds of the legislatures of the states so request,
   Congress is required to call a convention for the purpose of proposing
   amendments. This provision, many scholars argue, checks the power of
   the Congress to limit potential constitutional amendments.

   The state legislatures have, in times past, used their power to apply
   for a national convention in order to pressure Congress into proposing
   the desired amendment. For example, the movement to amend the
   Constitution to provide for the direct election of U.S. Senators began
   to see such proposals regularly pass the House of Representatives only
   to die in the Senate from the early 1890s onward. As time went by, more
   and more state legislatures adopted resolutions demanding that a
   convention be called, thus pressuring the Senate to finally relent and
   approve what later became the Seventeenth Amendment for fear that such
   a convention—if permitted to assemble—might stray to include issues
   above and beyond just the direct election of U.S. Senators.^[citation
   needed]

   The President has no formal role in the constitutional amendment
   process. Article One provides, "every order, resolution, or vote, to
   which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be
   necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to
   the President of the United States; and before the same shall take
   effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be
   re-passed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives". As
   previously stated, the Constitution requires the concurrence of at
   least two-thirds of the members present of both the House of
   Representatives and the Senate to a joint resolution which proposes a
   constitutional amendment. In Hollingsworth v. Virginia (1798), the
   Supreme Court held that it is not necessary to place constitutional
   amendments before the President for signature and, by the same logic,
   the President is powerless to veto a proposed constitutional amendment.

Ratification of amendments[edit]

   After being officially proposed, either by Congress or a national
   convention of the states, a constitutional amendment must then be
   ratified by the legislatures of, or by ratifying conventions, in at
   least three-fourths of the states. Of the 27 amendments to the
   Constitution that have been ratified, Congress has specified the state
   conventions ratification method for only one: the 21st Amendment, which
   became part of the Constitution in 1933. Most states hold elections
   specifically for the purpose of choosing delegates. New Mexico
   provides, by state law, that the members of its legislature be the
   delegates at such a state ratification convention.

   Although a proposed amendment is effective after three-fourths of the
   states ratify it, states have, in many instances, ratified an amendment
   that has already become law, often for symbolic reasons. The states
   unanimously ratified the Bill of Rights; the Thirteenth Amendment,
   abolishing slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment, providing for equal
   protection and due process; the Fifteenth Amendment, prohibiting racial
   discrimination in voting; and the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women
   a federal constitutional right to vote.^[5] In several other amendment
   cases, the ratification process took over a century.

Deadline imposed on ratification process[edit]

   The Constitution does not expressly provide for a deadline on the state
   legislatures' or state ratifying conventions' consideration of proposed
   amendments. In Dillon v. Gloss (1921), the Supreme Court affirmed that
   Congress—if it so desires—could provide a deadline for ratification,
   writing:

     We do not find anything in the article which suggests that an
     amendment once proposed is to be open to ratification for all time,
     or that ratification in some of the states may be separated from
     that in others by many years and yet be effective. We do find that
     which strongly suggests the contrary. First, proposal and
     ratification are not treated as unrelated acts but as succeeding
     steps in a single endeavor, the natural inference being that they
     are not to be widely separated in time. Secondly, it is only when
     there is deemed to be a necessity therefor that amendments are to be
     proposed, the reasonable implication being that when proposed they
     are to be considered and disposed of presently. Thirdly, as
     ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people
     and is to be effective when had in three-fourths of the States,
     there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently hi
     contemporaneous in that number of States to reflect the will of the
     people in all sections at relatively the same period, which of
     course ratification scattered through a long series of years would
     not do.^[6]

   In the aforementioned Coleman v. Miller decision, the Supreme Court
   modified Dillon considerably, holding that the question of timeliness
   of ratification is a political and non-justiciable one, leaving the
   issue to Congress's discretion. It would appear that the length of time
   elapsing between proposal and ratification is irrelevant to the
   validity of the amendment. For example, the Twenty-seventh Amendment
   was proposed in 1789 and ratified more than 200 years later in 1992. On
   May 20, 1992, both houses of Congress adopted concurrent resolutions
   accepting the 27th Amendment's unorthodox ratification process as
   having been successful and valid.

   Beginning in 1917, Congress has usually—but not always—imposed
   deadlines on proposed amendments. The limitation originally took the
   form of a clause in the text of the constitutional amendment itself,
   such as, "This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been
   ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of
   three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of
   its submission to the States by the Congress." Such a clause may be
   found in the Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-first and Twenty-second
   Amendments. However, with the Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth
   and Twenty-sixth amendments, Congress instead placed the ratification
   deadline in the resolving clause of the joint resolution proposing the
   amendment rather than in the amendment's actual text. And in the cases
   of the Nineteenth Amendment (proposed in 1919) and the still-pending
   Child Labor Amendment (proposed in 1924), Congress chose specifically
   not to establish any deadline at all.

   As noted in Dillon, the Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress
   to set such deadlines on ratification. The power of Congress to extend
   an already-agreed-upon deadline, however, has not been settled. In 1978
   Congress extended the previously agreed-upon seven-year limit on the
   ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment by more than three years
   from a March 22, 1979, original deadline to a June 30, 1982, revised
   deadline. It was accepted that if the deadline had been contained
   within the actual text of the amendment itself, Congress could not have
   extended it, as doing so would involve changing the text of an
   amendment already ratified by some of the states. In the case of the
   Equal Rights Amendment, however, it was argued that since the original
   March 22, 1979, deadline was contained in only the resolving clause of
   the joint resolution proposing the amendment—rather than in the actual
   text of the amendment itself—that the deadline could be altered. In
   1981, the United States District Court for the District of Idaho,
   however, found that Congress did not have the authority to extend the
   deadline, even when only contained within the proposing joint
   resolution's resolving clause.^[7] The Supreme Court had decided to
   take up the case, bypassing the Court of Appeals,^[8] but before they
   could hear the case, the extended period granted by Congress had been
   exhausted without the necessary number of states, thus rendering the
   case moot.^[9] In order to avoid this controversy with the 1978
   constitutional amendment proposed to grant congressional representation
   to the residents of Washington, D.C., Congress returned to the habit of
   placing the deadline within the actual text of the amendment itself.
   The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment expired unratified in
   1985.

Exclusive means for amending the Constitution[edit]

   According to law professor Lawrence G. Sager, some commentators believe
   that there are other methods of constitutional amendment, outside of
   Article V.^[10] For example, law professor Akhil Amar believes that
   Article V is merely the exclusive way for the government to amend the
   Constitution, whereas (he says) the people themselves have a separate
   amendment power.^[11] Bruce Ackerman of Yale Law School argues that the
   Constitution can be amended by something he calls a "structural
   amendment" whereby the people alter their Constitutional order via
   succeeding elections.^[12] Similarly Sanford Levinson believes that
   Constitutional amendments have been made outside of Article V and as
   such it is not exclusive.^[13] Other scholars disagree with Amar,
   Ackerman, and Levinson. Some argue that the Constitution itself
   provides no mechanism for the American people to adopt constitutional
   amendments independently of Article V.^[14] Darren Patrick Guerra has
   argued that Article V is a vital part of the American Constitutional
   tradition and he defends Article V against modern critiques that
   Article V is either too difficult, too undemocratic, or too formal.
   Instead he argues that Article V provides a clear and stable way of
   amending the document that is explicit, authentic, and the exclusive
   means of amendment; it promotes wisdom and justice through enhancing
   deliberation and prudence; and it process complements federalism and
   separation of powers that are key features of the Constitution. He
   argues that Article V remains the most clear and powerful way to
   register the sovereign desires of the American public with regard to
   alterations of their fundamental law. In the end, Article V is an
   essential bulwark to maintaining a written Constitution that secures
   the rights of the people against both elites and themselves.^[15]

   In his farewell address, President George Washington said:^[16]

     If in the opinion of the People the distribution or modification of
     the Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be
     corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution
     designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though
     this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the
     customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The
     precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any
     partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.

   This statement by Washington has become controversial, and scholars
   disagree about whether it still describes the proper constitutional
   order in the United States.^[17] Scholars who dismiss Washington's
   position often argue that the Constitution itself was adopted without
   following the procedures in the Articles of Confederation.^[18]

   James Madison, known as the “Father of the Constitution,” was
   instrumental in devising its system of checks and balances. In
   Federalist No. 43, Madison made clear that the state-led amendment
   option was intended to be just as valid as the Congress-led option,
   saying: “[The Constitution] equally enables the general and the State
   governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be
   pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other." ^[19]

   Writing extensively about the amendment process in Federalist No. 85,
   Alexander Hamilton makes clear that Article V allows the States to hold
   the federal government accountable by allowing them to call an amending
   convention and propose specific amendments: “But every amendment to the
   Constitution, if once established, would be a single proposition, and
   might be brought forward singly...There can, therefore, be no
   comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of
   establishing in the first instance a complete Constitution.” “We may
   safely rely on the disposition of the State legislatures to erect
   barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.” ^[20]
