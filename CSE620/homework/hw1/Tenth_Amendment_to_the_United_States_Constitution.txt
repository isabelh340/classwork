   The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution,
   which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15,
   1791.^[1] It expresses the principle of federalism, which undergirds
   the entire plan of the original Constitution, by stating that the
   federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the
   Constitution, or those powers prohibited by the Constitution to the
   states or the people. The framers of this amendment had two purposes in
   mind when they drafted it. The first was a necessary rule of
   construction. The second was to reaffirm the nature of the federal
   system.^[2]

Text[edit]

   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives

     The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
     nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
     respectively, or to the people.^[3]

Drafting and adoption[edit]

   The Tenth Amendment is similar to an earlier provision of the Articles
   of Confederation: "Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and
   independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by
   this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in
   Congress assembled."^[4] After the Constitution was ratified, South
   Carolina Representative Thomas Tudor Tucker and Massachusetts
   Representative Elbridge Gerry separately proposed similar amendments
   limiting the federal government to powers "expressly" delegated, which
   would have denied implied powers.^[5] James Madison opposed the
   amendments, stating that "it was impossible to confine a Government to
   the exercise of express powers; there must necessarily be admitted
   powers by implication, unless the Constitution descended to recount
   every minutia."^[5] The word "expressly" ultimately did not appear in
   the Tenth Amendment as ratified, and therefore the Tenth Amendment did
   not reject the powers implied by the Necessary and Proper Clause.^[6]

   When he introduced the Tenth Amendment in Congress, James Madison
   explained that many states were eager to ratify this amendment, despite
   critics who deemed the amendment superfluous or unnecessary:

     I find, from looking into the amendments proposed by the State
     conventions, that several are particularly anxious that it should be
     declared in the Constitution, that the powers not therein delegated
     should be reserved to the several States. Perhaps words which may
     define this more precisely than the whole of the instrument now
     does, may be considered as superfluous. I admit they may be deemed
     unnecessary: but there can be no harm in making such a declaration,
     if gentlemen will allow that the fact is as stated. I am sure I
     understand it so, and do therefore propose it.^[7]

   The states decided to ratify the Tenth Amendment, and thus declined to
   signal that there are unenumerated powers in addition to unenumerated
   rights.^[8]^[9] The amendment rendered unambiguous what had previously
   been at most a mere suggestion or implication.

   The phrase "..., or to the people." was appended in handwriting by the
   clerk of the Senate as the Bill of Rights circulated between the two
   Houses of Congress.^[10]^[11]

Judicial interpretation[edit]

   The Tenth Amendment, which makes explicit the idea that the federal
   government is limited to only the powers granted in the Constitution,
   has been declared to be a truism by the Supreme Court. In United States
   v. Sprague (1931) the Supreme Court asserted that the amendment "added
   nothing to the [Constitution] as originally ratified."

   States and local governments have occasionally attempted to assert
   exemption from various federal regulations, especially in the areas of
   labor and environmental controls, using the Tenth Amendment as a basis
   for their claim. An often-repeated quote, from United States v. Darby
   Lumber, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941), reads as follows:

     The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not
     been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to
     suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship
     between the national and state governments as it had been
     established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its
     purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national
     government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the
     states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.

Forced participation or commandeering[edit]

   The Supreme Court rarely declares laws unconstitutional for violating
   the Tenth Amendment. In the modern era, the Court has only done so
   where the federal government compels the states to enforce federal
   statutes. In 1992, in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992),
   for only the second time in 55 years, the Supreme Court invalidated a
   portion of a federal law for violating the Tenth Amendment. The case
   challenged a portion of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy
   Amendments Act of 1985. The act provided three incentives for states to
   comply with statutory obligations to provide for the disposal of
   low-level radioactive waste. The first two incentives were monetary.
   The third, which was challenged in the case, obliged states to take
   title to any waste within their borders that was not disposed of prior
   to January 1, 1996, and made each state liable for all damages directly
   related to the waste. The Court, in a 6–3 decision, ruled that the
   imposition of that obligation on the states violated the Tenth
   Amendment. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the federal
   government can encourage the states to adopt certain regulations
   through the spending power (e.g. by attaching conditions to the receipt
   of federal funds, see South Dakota v. Dole), or through the commerce
   power (by directly pre-empting state law). However, Congress cannot
   directly compel states to enforce federal regulations.

   In 1998, the Court again ruled that the Brady Handgun Violence
   Prevention Act violated the Tenth Amendment (Printz v. United States,
   521 U.S. 898 (1997)). The act required state and local law enforcement
   officials to conduct background checks on persons attempting to
   purchase handguns. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority,
   applied New York v. United States to show that the law violated the
   Tenth Amendment. Since the act "forced participation of the State's
   executive in the actual administration of a federal program", it was
   unconstitutional.

Commerce clause[edit]

   In modern times, the Commerce Clause has become one of the most
   frequently-used sources of Congress's power, and thus its
   interpretation is very important in determining the allowable scope of
   federal government.^[citation needed]

   In the 20th century, complex economic challenges arising from the Great
   Depression triggered a reevaluation in both Congress and the Supreme
   Court of the use of Commerce Clause powers to maintain a strong
   national economy.^[citation needed]

   In Wickard v. Filburn (1942), in the context of World War II, the Court
   ruled that federal regulations of wheat production could
   constitutionally be applied to wheat grown for "home consumption" on a
   farm – that is, wheat grown to be fed to farm animals or otherwise
   consumed on the farm. The rationale was that a farmer's growing "his
   own wheat" can have a substantial cumulative effect on interstate
   commerce, because if all farmers were to exceed their production
   quotas, a significant amount of wheat would either not be sold on the
   market or would be bought from other producers. Hence, in the
   aggregate, if farmers were allowed to consume their own wheat, it would
   affect the interstate market in wheat.

   In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985), the
   Court changed the analytic framework to be applied in Tenth Amendment
   cases. Prior to the Garcia decision, the determination of whether there
   was state immunity from federal regulation turned on whether the state
   activity was "traditional" for or "integral" to the state government.
   The Court noted that this analysis was "unsound in principle and
   unworkable in practice", and rejected it without providing a
   replacement. The Court's holding declined to set any formula to provide
   guidance in future cases. Instead, it simply held "...we need go no
   further than to state that we perceive nothing in the overtime and
   minimum-wage requirements of the FLSA ... that is destructive of state
   sovereignty or violative of any constitutional provision." It left to
   future courts how best to determine when a particular federal
   regulation may be "destructive of state sovereignty or violative of any
   constitutional provision."

   In United States v. Lopez 514 U.S. 549 (1995), a federal law mandating
   a "gun-free zone" on and around public school campuses was struck down
   because, the Supreme Court ruled, there was no clause in the
   Constitution authorizing it. This was the first modern Supreme Court
   opinion to limit the government's power under the Commerce Clause. The
   opinion did not mention the Tenth Amendment, and the Court's 1985
   Garcia opinion remains the controlling authority on that subject.

   Most recently, the Commerce Clause was cited in the 2005 decision
   Gonzales v. Raich. In this case, a California woman sued the Drug
   Enforcement Administration after her medical marijuana crop was seized
   and destroyed by federal agents. Medical marijuana was explicitly made
   legal under California state law by Proposition 215; however, marijuana
   is prohibited at the federal level by the Controlled Substances Act.
   Even though the woman grew the marijuana strictly for her own
   consumption and never sold any, the Supreme Court stated that growing
   one's own marijuana affects the interstate market of marijuana. The
   theory was that the marijuana could enter the stream of interstate
   commerce, even if it clearly wasn't grown for that purpose and that was
   unlikely ever to happen (the same reasoning as in the Wickard v.
   Filburn decision). It therefore ruled that this practice may be
   regulated by the federal government under the authority of the Commerce
   Clause.

Federal funding[edit]

   The federal system limits the ability of the federal government to use
   state governments as an instrument of the national government, as held
   in Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997). However, where
   Congress or the Executive has the power to implement programs, or
   otherwise regulate, there are, arguably, certain incentives in the
   national government encouraging States to become the instruments of
   such national policy, rather than to implement the program directly.
   One incentive is that state implementation of national programs places
   implementation in the hands of local officials who are closer to local
   circumstances. Another incentive is that implementation of federal
   programs at the state level would in principle limit the growth of the
   national bureaucracy.^[citation needed]

   For this reason, Congress often seeks to exercise its powers by
   offering or encouraging States to implement national programs
   consistent with national minimum standards; a system known as
   cooperative federalism. One example of the exercise of this device was
   to condition allocation of federal funding where certain state laws do
   not conform to federal guidelines. For example, federal educational
   funds may not be accepted without implementation of special education
   programs in compliance with IDEA. Similarly, the nationwide state
   55 mph (90 km/h) speed limit, .08 legal blood alcohol limit, and the
   nationwide state 21-year drinking age were imposed through this method;
   the states would lose highway funding if they refused to pass such laws
   (though the national speed limit has since been repealed). See e.g.
   South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).

State legislative actions in protest of federal actions[edit]

   Several states have introduced various resolutions and legislation in
   protest to federal actions.^[12] Despite this, the Supreme Court has
   explicitly rejected the idea that the states can nullify federal law.
   In Cooper v. Aaron (1958), the Supreme Court of the United States held
   that federal law prevails over state law due to the operation of the
   Supremacy Clause, and that federal law "can neither be nullified openly
   and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial
   officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes . .
   ." Thus, state laws purporting to nullify federal statutes or to exempt
   states and their citizens from federal statutes have only symbolic
   impact.

State sovereignty resolutions (10th Amendment resolutions)[edit]

   These resolutions attempt to reassert state sovereignty over any area
   not listed among the "enumerated powers" (i.e., any law based on an
   "expansive reading" of the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper
   Clause, or the Supremacy Clause would, according to this resolution, be
   invalid).
     * During 2009, "state sovereignty resolutions" or "10th Amendment
       Resolutions" were introduced in the legislatures of 37 states; in
       seven states the resolutions passed (Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota,
       South Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Tennessee).
     * During 2010, resolutions were introduced or reintroduced into the
       legislatures of 21 states; the resolution passed in seven states
       (Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah, and
       Wyoming).^[13]^[14]
     * A state sovereignty resolution has been prefiled for the upcoming
       2011 session of the Texas Legislature (a prior 2009 resolution did
       not pass).

State sovereignty bills (10th Amendment Bills)[edit]

   A "State Sovereignty Bill" is one step beyond a State Sovereignty
   Resolution. The bill would mandate action against what the state
   legislature perceives as unconstitutional federal legislation.
     * During 2010, such legislation was introduced in six states
       (Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, and
       Oklahoma); however, none made it past the introductory stage.^[15]

Firearms freedom legislation and federal gun laws nullification[edit]

   Starting in 2012, in response to a threat of law made through executive
   orders by President Obama, more than a dozen states around the US began
   proposing legislation that would "...declare that any firearms made and
   retained in-state are beyond the authority of Congress under its
   constitutional power to regulate commerce among the states". The
   legislation would require that the firearm be prominently marked as
   being "Made in {name of state}" and further prohibit federal regulation
   solely on the basis that "basic materials" and "generic and
   insignificant parts" of the firearm may have their origins from outside
   the state.
     * Through 2010, resolutions have been introduced in the legislatures
       of 27 states that would nullify federal authority over such local
       firearms. The legislation passed in Montana and Tennessee in 2009
       and in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming the
       following year.^[16] South Carolina has taken the issue one step
       further: in 2010 a bill was introduced which would effectively
       nullify all gun registration laws within the state.^[17]
     * Texas has prefiled^[18] and West Virginia has filed^[19] similar
       legislation for the current 2011 legislative session.
     * In 2013, one of the most strongly worded Second Amendment
       protection acts in the nation was signed into law in Kansas.^[20]

Marijuana laws[edit]

   As of May 2014^[update], 23 states (Alaska, Arizona, California,
   Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,
   Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
   Washington) and the District of Columbia have passed legislation which
   permit the use of medical marijuana.^[21] California Proposition 19
   would have gone one step further, and legalized marijuana use by
   persons over age 21 for any purpose whatsoever;^[22] however, the state
   constitutional amendment did not pass.

   In 2012, both Washington and Colorado legalized the recreational use of
   marijuana. Both states previously legalized the use of medical
   marijuana. The ballot measure allows for anyone over 21 to possess up
   to an ounce from licensed vendors.^[23] Colorado also allows you to
   grow up to 6 plants.^[24] The Obama administration announced in October
   2009 that it advised federal prosecutors not to target
   legally-operating medicinal marijuana users, or their suppliers, in
   states that have passed such laws.^[25]^[26] However, in the same year,
   the DEA conducted a record number of medical marijuana raids.^[27]

   The DEA has continued to raid federally prohibited medical facilities
   in several states,^[28]^[29]^[30] and the DOJ has gone so far as to
   prevent such cases from being well publicized.^[31]

   The IRS has also attempted to prevent the sale of medical marijuana in
   California by refusing to treat normally-deductible business expenses
   as such for dispensaries, notably for the Harborside Health Center in
   Oakland.^[32]^[33]

REAL ID Act[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], 25 states (beginning with Maine in 2007)
   have passed legislation and/or resolutions which opposed the REAL ID
   Act. Though the legislation is still on the books, its implementation
   has been delayed on several occasions and is currently not being
   enforced.^[34]

National health care nullification[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in 30 states had introduced
   legislation which would declare certain provisions of any proposed
   national health care bill to be null and void within the state; the
   legislation passed in Arizona, Idaho, Utah, and Virginia.^[35] Such
   provisions include mandatory participation in such a system as well as
   preserving the right of a patient to pay a health care professional for
   treatment (and for the professional to accept it) outside of a
   single-payer system. Arizona's legislation passed as a proposed
   constitutional amendment, approved by voters in 2010.^[36] On February
   1, 2010, the Virginia Senate took a stand against a key provision of a
   proposed federal health care overhaul, passing legislation declaring
   that Virginia residents cannot be forced to buy health insurance. On
   March 17, 2010, Idaho Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter signed a bill
   requiring the Attorney General to sue the federal government if Idaho
   residents are required to buy health insurance.^[37]

Bring the Guard home[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in seven states had introduced
   legislation which would permit the governor of the state to recall any
   National Guard troops from overseas deployments (such as in Iraq and
   Afghanistan); the bills failed in Maryland and New Mexico.^[38]

Legal tender[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in seven states have introduced
   legislation which would seek to nullify federal legal tender laws in
   the state by authorizing payment in gold and silver or a paper note
   backed 100% by gold or silver; the legislation failed in Colorado and
   Montana.^[39]

Cap-and-trade nullification[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in four states have introduced
   legislation which would nullify any proposed federal emissions
   regulation under the "cap-and-trade" model; none have advanced beyond
   the introductory stage.^[40]

State sovereignty and federal tax funds acts[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in three states have introduced
   legislation which would require businesses (and in some cases,
   individuals) to remit their federal tax payments to the state treasurer
   (or equivalent body) for deposit into an escrow fund. If the state
   legislature determined that a portion of the federal budget was not
   constitutional, or if the federal government imposed penalties or
   sanctions upon the state for creating the fund, then the money would be
   withheld. None have advanced beyond the introductory stage.^[41]

Sheriffs first legislation[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in three states had introduced
   legislation which would make it a crime for any federal agent to make
   an arrest, search or seizure within the state without getting the
   advance, written permission of the sheriff of the county in which the
   event would take place. The bills would provide for the following
   exceptions:
     * Actions on federal property
     * A federal employee witnesses a crime requiring an immediate arrest
     * Actions under either hot pursuit or involving immigration
     * The person to be apprehended is either an elected county or state
       officer, an employee of the sheriff's office, or has such close
       connection with the sheriff that the person is likely to be
       notified by the sheriff of any impending action.^[42]

   None have advanced beyond the introductory stage.^[43]

Federal land legislation[edit]

   As of February 2010^[update], legislators in Utah have introduced
   legislation to allow the use of eminent domain on federal land. Rep.
   Christopher Herrod has introduced the bill in a state where the federal
   government controls over 60% of the land. The effort has the full
   support of Republican Attorney General Mark Shurtleff, who would have
   to defend the law. The proposal includes setting aside $3 million for
   legal defense.^[44]^[45]

Nullification of federal intrastate commerce regulation[edit]

   As of March 2010^[update], legislators in four states had introduced
   legislation which would nullify federal regulation of trade and
   activities which are solely within the boundaries of a state and which
   do not cross state lines; that is activities that are by definition NOT
   COMMERCE, under the Constitution.^[citation needed] The Virginia
   legislation has passed one house.^[46]^[not in citation given]

Sanctuary city[edit]

   Another form of protest against enforcement of immigration laws,
   several United States cities have declared themselves sanctuary cities,
   whereby they have ordered the local police department to specifically
   not work with United States Customs and Border Protection officials to
   arrest persons illegally residing within the boundaries of the city,
   and not to inquire as to a person's immigration status, even if the
   person was arrested.^[47]

Intrastate Coal and Use Act[edit]

   In protest of the Environmental Protection Agency allegedly
   overstepping its authority by interfering with intrastate commerce, the
   West Virginia Intrastate Coal and Use Act (H.B. 2554)^[48] was being
   introduced into the West Virginia House of Delegates by Delegate Gary
   Howell. The bill states that coal sold and used within the borders of
   West Virginia is not subject to EPA authority because no interstate
   commerce exists and the state retains the rights to control its own
   intrastate commerce under the 10th Amendment.^[49]^[50]^[51] The
   American Legislative Exchange Council recommends the Intrastate Coal
   and Use Act for model legislation in other states.^[52]
