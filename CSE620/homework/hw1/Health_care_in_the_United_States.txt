   Health care in the United States is provided by many distinct
   organizations.^[1] Health care facilities are largely owned and
   operated by private sector businesses. 62% of the hospitals are
   non-profit, 20% are government owned, 18% are for-profit.^[2]

   60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as
   Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the Children's Health Insurance Program,
   and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 67
   is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health
   insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. Health
   insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the
   government.

   The United States life expectancy of 78.4 years at birth, up from 75.2
   years in 1990, ranks it 50th among 221 nations, and 27th out of the 34
   industrialized OECD countries, down from 20th in 1990.^[3]^[4] Of 17
   high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in
   2013, the United States had the highest or near-highest prevalence of
   infant mortality, heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted
   infections, adolescent pregnancies, injuries, homicides, and
   disability. Together, such issues place the U.S. at the bottom of the
   list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to
   live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country.^[5]

   According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States
   spent more on health care per capita ($8,608), and more on health care
   as percentage of its GDP (17.2%), than any other nation in 2011. The
   Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of
   health care among similar countries, and notes U.S. care costs the
   most. In a 2013 Bloomberg ranking of nations with the most efficient
   health care systems, the United States ranks 46th among the 48
   countries included in the study.^[6]^[7]

   The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 49.9 million residents, 16.3% of
   the population, were uninsured in 2010 (up from 49.0 million residents,
   16.1% of the population, in 2009). A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM)
   report said: "The United States is among the few industrialized nations
   in the world that does not guarantee access to health care for its
   population." A 2004 OECD report said: "With the exception of Mexico,
   Turkey, and the United States, all OECD countries had achieved
   universal or near-universal (at least 98.4% insured) coverage of their
   populations by 1990." Recent evidence demonstrates that lack of health
   insurance causes some 45,000 to 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in
   the United States.^[8]^[9] In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies
   claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all
   senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are
   forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence.^[10]

   On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
   (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.
   The medical system will be forced to change normal procedures.^[1] They
   will be required to prepare for upcoming programs to meet federal
   regulations.^[11]

   world

Statistics[edit]

   Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector
   businesses. Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily
   provided by the government.^[citation needed] 60–65% of healthcare
   provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid,
   TRICARE, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans
   Health Administration.^[citation needed] Most of the population under
   65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health
   insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured.

   Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of
   Health in 2013, the United States was at or near the bottom in infant
   mortality, heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections,
   adolescent pregnancies, injuries, homicides, and rates of disability.
   Together, such issues place the U.S. at the bottom of the list for life
   expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four
   fewer years than those in the top-ranked country.^[5]

   A study by the National Institutes of Health reported that the lifetime
   per capita expenditure at birth, using year 2000 dollars, showed a
   large difference between health care costs of females ($361,192) and
   males ($268,679). A large portion of this cost difference is in the
   shorter lifespan of men, but even after adjustment for age (assume men
   live as long as women), there still is a 20% difference in lifetime
   health care expenditures.^[12]

   There is evidence, however, that a large proportion of health outcomes
   and early mortality can be attributed to other factors. As a study by
   the National Research Council concluded, more than half the men who die
   before 50 die due to murder (19%), traffic accidents (18%), and other
   accidents (16%). For women the percentages are different. 53% of women
   who die before 50 die due to disease, whereas 38% die due to accidents,
   homicide, and suicide.^[13]

   A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found
   that there were 38.6 million hospital stays in the U.S. in 2011, an 11
   percent increase since 1997. Since the population also grew during this
   period, the hospitalization rate remained stable at approximately 1,200
   stays per 10,000 population.^[14]

   The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 49.9 million residents, 16.3% of
   the population, were uninsured in 2010 (up from 49.0 million residents,
   16.1% of the population, in 2009).^[15]^[16] According to the World
   Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on health care
   per capita ($7,146), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP
   (15.2%), than any other nation in 2008.^[17] The United States had the
   fourth highest level of government health care spending per capita
   ($3,426), behind three countries with higher levels of GDP per capita:
   Monaco, Luxembourg, and Norway.^[17] A 2001 study in five states found
   that medical debt contributed to 46.2% of all personal bankruptcies and
   in 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical
   expenses.^[18] Since then, health costs and the numbers of uninsured
   and underinsured have increased.^[19] A 2013 study found that about 25%
   of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses.^[10]

   Active debate about health care reform in the United States concerns
   questions of a right to health care, access, fairness, efficiency,
   cost, choice, value, and quality. Some have argued that the system does
   not deliver equivalent value for the money spent. The U.S. pays twice
   as much as Canada yet lags behind other wealthy nations in such
   measures as infant mortality and life expectancy. Currently, the U.S.
   has a higher infant mortality rate than most of the world's
   industrialized nations.^[nb 1]^[20] In the United States life
   expectancy is 42nd in the world, after some other industrialized
   nations, lagging the other nations of the G5 (Japan, France, Germany,
   U.K., U.S.) and just after Chile (35th) and Cuba (37th).^[21]

   Life expectancy at birth in the U.S., 78.49, is 50th in the world,
   below most developed nations and some developing nations. Monaco is
   first with 89.68. Chad is last with 48.69. With 72.4% Americans of
   European ancestry,^[22] life expectancy is below the average life
   expectancy for the European Union.^[23]^[24] The World Health
   Organization (WHO), in 2000, ranked the U.S. health care system as the
   highest in cost, first in responsiveness, 37th in overall performance,
   and 72nd by overall level of health (among 191 member nations included
   in the study).^[25]^[26] The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States
   last in the quality of health care among similar countries,^[27] and
   notes U.S. care costs the most.^[28]

   United States ranks close to the bottom compared to other
   industrialized countries on several important health issues affecting
   mortality: low birth weight and infant mortality, injuries and murder,
   teen pregnancy and STDs, HIV and AIDS, deaths resulting from drug
   overdoses, obesity and diabetes, heart disease, COPD, and general
   disability.^[29]

   A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report said: "The United States is
   among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not
   guarantee access to health care for its population."^[30] A 2004 OECD
   report said: "With the exception of Mexico, Turkey, and the United
   States, all OECD countries had achieved universal or near-universal (at
   least 98.4% insured) coverage of their populations by 1990."^[31] The
   2004 IOM report observed "lack of health insurance causes roughly
   18,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States."^[30] while
   a 2009 Harvard study estimated that 44,800 excess deaths occurred
   annually due to lack of health insurance.^[32]

   On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
   (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health
   insurance.^[33]

Providers[edit]

   Health care providers in the U.S. encompass individual health care
   personnel, health care facilities and medical products.

Facilities[edit]

   Main article: Medical centers in the United States

   In the U.S., ownership of the health care system is mainly in private
   hands, though federal, state, county, and city governments also own
   certain facilities.

   The non-profit hospitals share of total hospital capacity has remained
   relatively stable (about 70%) for decades.^[34] There are also
   privately owned for-profit hospitals as well as government hospitals in
   some locations, mainly owned by county and city governments. The
   Hill-Burton Act was passed in 1946, which provided federal funding for
   hospitals in exchange for treating poor patients.^[35]

   There is no nationwide system of government-owned medical facilities
   open to the general public but there are local government-owned medical
   facilities open to the general public. The U.S. Department of Defense
   operates field hospitals as well as permanent hospitals via the
   Military Health System to provide military-funded care to active
   military personnel.

   The federal Veterans Health Administration operates VA hospitals open
   only to veterans, though veterans who seek medical care for conditions
   they did not receive while serving in the military are charged for
   services. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates facilities open only
   to Native Americans from recognized tribes. These facilities, plus
   tribal facilities and privately contracted services funded by IHS to
   increase system capacity and capabilities, provide medical care to
   tribespeople beyond what can be paid for by any private insurance or
   other government programs.^[36]

   Hospitals provide some outpatient care in their emergency rooms and
   specialty clinics, but primarily exist to provide inpatient care.
   Hospital emergency departments and urgent care centers are sources of
   sporadic problem-focused care. Surgicenters are examples of specialty
   clinics. Hospice services for the terminally ill who are expected to
   live six months or less are most commonly subsidized by charities and
   government. Prenatal, family planning, and dysplasia clinics are
   government-funded obstetric and gynecologic specialty clinics
   respectively, and are usually staffed by nurse practitioners.

Physicians (M.D. and D.O.)[edit]

   Main article: Physician in the United States

   Physicians in the U.S. include those trained by the U.S. medical
   education system, and those that are international medical graduates
   who have progressed through the necessary steps to acquire a medical
   license to practice in a state.

   The American College of Physicians, uses the term physician to describe
   all medical practitioners holding a professional medical degree. In the
   U.S., however, most physicians have either an Doctor of Medicine (M.D.)
   or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. The American Medical
   Association as well as the American Osteopathic Association both
   currently use the term physician to describe members.

Medical products, research and development[edit]

   As in most other countries, the manufacture and production of
   pharmaceuticals and medical devices is carried out by private
   companies. The research and development of medical devices and
   pharmaceuticals is supported by both public and private sources of
   funding. In 2003, research and development expenditures were
   approximately $95 billion with $40 billion coming from public sources
   and $55 billion coming from private sources.^[37]^[38] These
   investments into medical research have made the United States the
   leader in medical innovation, measured either in terms of revenue or
   the number of new drugs and devices introduced.^[39]^[40] In 2006, the
   United States accounted for three quarters of the world's biotechnology
   revenues and 82% of world R&D spending in biotechnology.^[39]^[40]
   According to multiple international pharmaceutical trade groups, the
   high cost of patented drugs in the U.S. has encouraged substantial
   reinvestment in such research and development.^[39]^[40]^[41] Though
   PPACA, also known as Obamacare or ACA, will force industry to sell
   medicine at a cheaper price. Reference behind paywall ^[42] Due to
   this, it is possible budget cuts will be made on research and
   development of human health and medicine in America. Reference behind
   paywall ^[42]

Spending[edit]

   Main article: Health care spending in the United States
   U.S. healthcare costs exceed those of other countries, relative to the
   size of the economy or GDP.

   Health care spending in the U.S. is characterized as being the most
   costly per person as compared to all other countries, and despite this
   spending, the quality of health care outcomes overall is relatively low
   by some measures (e.g., infant mortality).^[citation needed]

   Aggregate U.S. hospital costs were $387.3 billion in 2011—a 63%
   increase since 1997 (inflation adjusted). Costs per stay increased 47%
   since 1997, averaging $10,000 in 2011.^[14]

   According to the World Health Organization (WHO), total health care
   spending in the U.S. was 17.9% of its GDP in 2011, the highest in the
   world.^[17] The Health and Human Services Department expects that the
   health share of GDP will continue its historical upward trend, reaching
   19.5% of GDP by 2017.^[43]^[44] Of each dollar spent on health care in
   the United States, 31% goes to hospital care, 21% goes to
   physician/clinical services, 10% to pharmaceuticals, 4% to dental, 6%
   to nursing homes and 3% to home health care, 3% for other retail
   products, 3% for government public health activities, 7% to
   administrative costs, 7% to investment, and 6% to other professional
   services (physical therapists, optometrists, etc.).^[45] The
   Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of
   health care among similar countries,^[27] and notes U.S. care costs the
   most.^[28]

   Around 84.7% of Americans have some form of health insurance; either
   through their employer or the employer of their spouse or parent
   (59.3%), purchased individually (8.9%), or provided by government
   programs (27.8%; there is some overlap in these figures).^[46] All
   government health care programs have restricted eligibility, and there
   is no government health insurance company which covers all Americans.
   Americans without health insurance coverage in 2007 totaled 15.3% of
   the population, or 45.7 million people.^[46]

   Among those whose employer pays for health insurance, the employee may
   be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the
   employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups,
   negotiates with the insurance company. Government programs directly
   cover 27.8% of the population (83 million),^[46] including the elderly,
   disabled, children, veterans, and some of the poor, and federal law
   mandates public access to emergency services regardless of ability to
   pay. Public spending accounts for between 45% and 56.1% of U.S. health
   care spending.^[47]

   Some Americans do not qualify for government-provided health insurance,
   are not provided health insurance by an employer, and are unable to
   afford, cannot qualify for, or choose not to purchase, private health
   insurance. When charity or "uncompensated" care is not available, they
   sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment. This problem has
   become a source of considerable political controversy on a national
   level.^[verification needed]

Regulation and oversight[edit]

   Further information: American Board of Medical Specialties, United
   States Medical Licensing Examination and National Association of
   Insurance Commissioners

Involved organizations and institutions[edit]

   Healthcare is subject to extensive regulation at both the federal and
   the state level, much of which "arose haphazardly".^[48] Under this
   system, the federal government cedes primary responsibility to the
   states under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Essential regulation includes
   the licensure of health care providers at the state level and the
   testing and approval of pharmaceuticals and medical devices by the U.S.
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and laboratory testing. These
   regulations are designed to protect consumers from ineffective or
   fraudulent healthcare. Additionally, states regulate the health
   insurance market and they often have laws which require that health
   insurance companies cover certain procedures,^[49] although state
   mandates generally do not apply to the self-funded health care plans
   offered by large employers, which exempt from state laws under
   preemption clause of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In
   2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was passed
   by President Barack Obama and includes various new regulations, with
   one of the most notable being a health insurance mandate which requires
   all citizens to purchase health insurance. While not regulation per se,
   the federal government also has a major influence on the healthcare
   market through its payments to providers under Medicare and Medicaid,
   which in some cases are used as a reference point in the negotiations
   between medical providers and insurance companies.^[48]

   At the federal level, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
   oversees the various federal agencies involved in health care. The
   health agencies are a part of the U.S. Public Health Service, and
   include the Food and Drug Administration, which certifies the safety of
   food, effectiveness of drugs and medical products, the Centers for
   Disease Prevention, which prevents disease, premature death, and
   disability, the Agency of Health Care Research and Quality, the Agency
   Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which regulates hazardous spills
   of toxic substances, and the National Institutes of Health, which
   conducts medical research.

   State governments maintain state health departments, and local
   governments (counties and municipalities) often have their own health
   departments, usually branches of the state health department.
   Regulations of a state board may have executive and police strength to
   enforce state health laws. In some states, all members of state boards
   must be health care professionals. Members of state boards may be
   assigned by the governor or elected by the state committee. Members of
   local boards may be elected by the mayor council. The McCarran–Ferguson
   Act, which cedes regulation to the states, does not itself regulate
   insurance, nor does it mandate that states regulate insurance. "Acts of
   Congress" that do not expressly purport to regulate the "business of
   insurance" will not preempt state laws or regulations that regulate the
   "business of insurance." The Act also provides that federal anti-trust
   laws will not apply to the "business of insurance" as long as the state
   regulates in that area, but federal anti-trust laws will apply in cases
   of boycott, coercion, and intimidation. By contrast, most other federal
   laws will not apply to insurance whether the states regulate in that
   area or not.

   Self-policing of providers by providers is a major part of oversight.
   Many health care organizations also voluntarily submit to inspection
   and certification by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital
   Organizations, JCAHO. Providers also undergo testing to obtain board
   certification attesting to their skills. A report issued by Public
   Citizen in April 2008 found that, for the third year in a row, the
   number of serious disciplinary actions against physicians by state
   medical boards declined from 2006 to 2007, and called for more
   oversight of the boards.^[50]

   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publishes an
   on-line searchable database of performance data on nursing homes.^[51]
   In 2004, conservative think tank Cato Institute published a study which
   concluded that regulation provides benefits in the amount of
   $170 billion but costs the public up to $340 billion.^[52] The study
   concluded that the majority of the cost differential arises from
   medical malpractice, FDA regulations, and facilities regulations.^[52]

"Certificates of need" for hospitals[edit]

   In 1978, the federal government required that all states implement
   Certificate of Need (CON) programs for cardiac care, meaning that
   hospitals had to apply and receive certificates prior to implementing
   the program; the intent was to reduce cost by reducing duplicate
   investments in facilities.^[53] It has been observed that these
   certificates could be used to increase costs through weakened
   competition.^[48] Many states removed the CON programs after the
   federal requirement expired in 1986, but some states still have these
   programs.^[53] Empirical research looking at the costs in areas where
   these programs have been discontinued have not found a clear effect on
   costs, and the CON programs could decrease costs because of reduced
   facility construction or increase costs due to reduced
   competition.^[53]

Licensing of providers[edit]

   The American Medical Association (AMA) has lobbied the government to
   highly limit physician education since 1910, currently at 100,000
   doctors per year,^[54] which has led to a shortage of doctors^[55] and
   physicians' wages in the U.S. are double those in the Europe, which is
   a major reason for the more expensive health care.^[56]

   An even bigger problem may be that the doctors are paid for procedures
   instead of results.^[56]

   The AMA has also aggressively lobbied for many restrictions that
   require doctors to carry out operations that might be carried out by
   cheaper workforce. For example, in 1995, 36 states banned or restricted
   midwifery even though it delivers equally safe care to that by doctors,
   according to studies ^[clarification needed]. The regulation lobbied by
   the AMA has decreased the amount and quality of health care, according
   to the consensus of economist: the restrictions do not add to quality,
   they decrease the supply of care.^[54]^[57] ^[clarification needed]
   Moreover, psychologists, nurses and pharmacists are not allowed to
   prescribe medicines.^[clarification needed] Previously nurses were not
   even allowed to vaccinate the patients without direct supervision by
   doctors.

   36 states require that health care workers undergo criminal background
   checks.^[58]

Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)[edit]

   Main article: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act

   EMTALA, enacted by the federal government in 1986, requires that
   hospital emergency departments treat emergency conditions of all
   patients regardless of their ability to pay and is considered a
   critical element in the "safety net" for the uninsured, but established
   no direct payment mechanism for such care. Indirect payments and
   reimbursements through federal and state government programs have never
   fully compensated public and private hospitals for the full cost of
   care mandated by EMTALA. More than half of all emergency care in the
   U.S. now goes uncompensated.^[59] According to some analyses, EMTALA is
   an unfunded mandate that has contributed to financial pressures on
   hospitals in the last 20 years, causing them to consolidate and close
   facilities, and contributing to emergency room overcrowding. According
   to the Institute of Medicine, between 1993 and 2003, emergency room
   visits in the U.S. grew by 26%, while in the same period, the number of
   emergency departments declined by 425.^[60]

   Mentally ill patients present a unique challenge for emergency
   departments and hospitals. In accordance with EMTALA, mentally ill
   patients who enter emergency rooms are evaluated for emergency medical
   conditions. Once mentally ill patients are medically stable, regional
   mental health agencies are contacted to evaluate them. Patients are
   evaluated as to whether they are a danger to themselves or others.
   Those meeting this criterion are admitted to a mental health facility
   to be further evaluated by a psychiatrist. Typically, mentally ill
   patients can be held for up to 72 hours, after which a court order is
   required.^[citation needed]

Quality assurance[edit]

   Health care quality assurance consists of the "activities and programs
   intended to assure or improve the quality of care in either a defined
   medical setting or a program. The concept includes the assessment or
   evaluation of the quality of care; identification of problems or
   shortcomings in the delivery of care; designing activities to overcome
   these deficiencies; and follow-up monitoring to ensure effectiveness of
   corrective steps."^[61]

   One innovation in encouraging quality of health care is the public
   reporting of the performance of hospitals, health professionals or
   providers, and healthcare organizations. However, there is "no
   consistent evidence that the public release of performance data changes
   consumer behaviour or improves care."^[62]

Overall system effectiveness[edit]

Measures of effectiveness[edit]

   The US health care delivery system unevenly provides medical care of
   varying quality to its population.^[63] In a highly effective health
   care system, individuals would receive reliable care that meets their
   needs and is based on the best scientific knowledge available. In order
   to monitor and evaluate system effectiveness, researchers and policy
   makers track system measures and trends over time. The US Department of
   Health and Human Services(HHS) populates a publicly available dashboard
   called, the Health System Measurement Project
   (healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov), to ensure a robust monitoring system.
   The dashboard captures the access, quality and cost of care; overall
   population health; and health system dynamics (e.g., workforce,
   innovation, health information technology). Included measures align
   with other system performance measuring activities including the HHS
   Strategic Plan,^[64] the Government Performance and Results Act,
   Healthy People 2020, and the National Strategies for Quality and
   Prevention.^[65]^[66]

Access to care: Cost, affordability, coverage[edit]

   The US health system does not provide health care to the country’s
   entire population.^[67] Individuals acquire health insurance to offset
   health care spending. However, lack of adequate health insurance
   persists and is a known barrier to accessing the healthcare system and
   receiving appropriate and timely care.^[68]^[69] Measures of
   accessibility and affordability tracked by national health surveys
   include: having a usual source of medical care, visiting the dentist
   yearly, rates of preventable hospitalizations, reported difficulty
   seeing a specialist, delaying care due to cost, and rates of health
   insurance coverage.^[70]
     * As a country, rising health care costs have raised concerns among
       the public and private sector alike. Between 2000 and 2011, health
       care expenditures nearly doubled, growing from $1.2 trillion to
       $2.3 trillion [CDC Health, United States, 2013]. Evidence suggests
       the rate of growth has slowed in recent years.^[71] Other measures
       of cost captured by national surveys include: health insurance
       premiums, high out of pocket costs (e.g., deductibles, copayments),
       and national health expenditures including individual, employer,
       and government expenditures.^[72]

Population health: Quality, prevention, vulnerable populations[edit]

   The health of the population is also viewed as a measure of the overall
   effectiveness of the healthcare system. The extent to which the
   population lives longer healthier lives signals an effective system.
     * While life expectancy is one measure, HHS uses a composite health
       measure that estimates not only the average length of life, but
       also, the part of life expectancy that is expected to be “in good
       or better health, as well as free of activity limitations." Between
       1997 and 2010, the number of expected high quality life years
       increased from 61.1 to 63.2 years for newborns.^[73]
     * The underutilization of preventative measures, rates of preventable
       illness and prevalence of chronic disease suggest that the US
       healthcare system does not sufficiently promote wellness.^[65] Over
       the past decade rates of teen pregnancy and low birth rates have
       come down significantly, but not disappeared.^[74] Rates of
       obesity, heart disease (high blood pressure, controlled high
       cholesterol), and diabetes are areas of major concern. While
       chronic disease and multiple co-morbidities became increasingly
       common among a population of elderly Americans who were living
       longer, the public health system has also found itself fending off
       a rise of chronically ill younger generation. According to the US
       Surgeon General “The prevalence of obesity in the U.S. more than
       doubled (from 15% to 34%) among adults and more than tripled (from
       5% to 17%) among children and adolescents from 1980 to 2008.”^[75]
     * A concern for the health system is that the health gains do not
       accrue equally to the entire population. In the United States,
       disparities in health care and health outcomes are widespread.^[76]
       Minorities are more likely to suffer from serious illnesses (e.g.,
       diabetes, heart disease and colon cancer) and less likely to have
       access to quality health care, including preventative
       services.^[77] Efforts are underway to close the gap and to provide
       a more equitable system of care.

Innovation: Workforce, healthcare IT, R&D[edit]

   Finally, the United States tracks investment in the healthcare system
   in terms of a skilled healthcare workforce, meaningful use of
   healthcare IT, and R&D output. This aspect of the healthcare system
   performance dashboard is important to consider when evaluating cost of
   care in America. That is because in much of the policy debate around
   the high cost of US healthcare, proponents of highly specialized and
   cutting edge technologies point to innovation as a marker of an
   effective health care system.^[78]

Compared to other countries[edit]

   Life expectancy compared to healthcare spending from 1970 to 2008, in
   the US and the next 19 most wealthy countries by total GDP.^[79]

   A 2014 study by the private American foundation The Commonwealth Fund
   found that although the U.S. health care system is the most expensive
   in the world, it ranks last on most dimensions of performance when
   compared with Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New
   Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The study
   found that the United States failed to achieve better outcomes than
   other countries, and is last or near last in terms of access,
   efficiency and equity. Study date came from international surveys of
   patients and primary care physicians, as well as information on health
   care outcomes from The Commonwealth Fund, the World Health
   Organization, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development.^[80]^[81]

   The U.S. stands 50th in the world with a life expectancy of 78.49.^[82]
   The CIA World Factbook ranked the United States 174th worst (out of
   222) – meaning 48th best – in the world for infant mortality rate
   (5.98/1,000 live births).^[83]

   A study found that between 1997 and 2003, preventable deaths declined
   more slowly in the United States than in 18 other industrialized
   nations.^[84] A 2008 study found that 101,000 people a year die in the
   U.S. that would not if the health care system were as effective as that
   of France, Japan, or Australia.^[85]

   The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found
   that the U.S. ranked poorly in terms of years of potential life lost
   (YPLL), a statistical measure of years of life lost under the age of 70
   that were amenable to being saved by health care. Among OECD nations
   for which data are available, the United States ranked third last for
   the health care of women (after Mexico and Hungary) and fifth last for
   men (Slovakia and Poland also ranked worse).
   Further information: Years of potential life lost

   Recent studies find growing gaps in life expectancy based on income and
   geography. In 2008, a government-sponsored study found that life
   expectancy declined from 1983 to 1999 for women in 180 counties, and
   for men in 11 counties, with most of the life expectancy declines
   occurring in the Deep South, Appalachia, along the Mississippi River,
   in the Southern Plains and in Texas. The difference is as high as three
   years for men, six years for women. The gap is growing between rich and
   poor and by educational level, but narrowing between men and women and
   by race.^[86] Another study found that the mortality gap between the
   well-educated and the poorly educated widened significantly between
   1993 and 2001 for adults ages 25 through 64; the authors speculated
   that risk factors such as smoking, obesity and high blood pressure may
   lie behind these disparities.^[87] In 2011 the U.S. National Research
   Council forecasted that deaths attributed to smoking, on the decline in
   the US, will drop dramatically, improving life expectancy; it also
   suggested that one-fifth to one-third of the life expectancy difference
   can be attributed to obesity which is the worst in the world and has
   been increasing.^[88] In an analysis of breast cancer, colorectal
   cancer, and prostate cancer diagnosed during 1990–1994 in 31 countries,
   the U.S. had the highest five-year relative survival rate for breast
   cancer and prostate cancer, although survival was systematically and
   substantially lower in black U.S. men and women.^[89]

   The debate about U.S. health care concerns questions of access,
   efficiency, and quality purchased by the high sums spent. The World
   Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 ranked the U.S. health care system
   first in responsiveness, but 37th in overall performance and 72nd by
   overall level of health (among 191 member nations included in the
   study).^[25]^[26] The WHO study has been criticized by the free market
   advocate David Gratzer because "fairness in financial contribution" was
   used as an assessment factor, marking down countries with high
   per-capita private or fee-paying health treatment.^[90] The WHO study
   has been criticized, in an article published in Health Affairs, for its
   failure to include the satisfaction ratings of the general public.^[91]
   The study found that there was little correlation between the WHO
   rankings for health systems and the stated satisfaction of citizens
   using those systems.^[92] Countries such as Italy and Spain, which were
   given the highest ratings by WHO were ranked poorly by their citizens
   while other countries, such as Denmark and Finland, were given low
   scores by WHO but had the highest percentages of citizens reporting
   satisfaction with their health care systems.^[92] WHO staff, however,
   say that the WHO analysis does reflect system "responsiveness" and
   argue that this is a superior measure to consumer satisfaction, which
   is influenced by expectations.^[93] Furthermore, the relationship
   between patient satisfaction and health care utilization, expenditures,
   and outcomes is complex and not well defined.^[94]

   A report released in April 2008 by the Foundation for Child
   Development, which studied the period from 1994 through 2006, found
   mixed results for the health of children in the U.S. Mortality rates
   for children ages 1 through 4 dropped by a third, and the percentage of
   children with elevated blood lead levels dropped by 84%. The percentage
   of mothers who smoked during pregnancy also declined. On the other
   hand, both obesity and the percentage of low-birth weight babies
   increased. The authors note that the increase in babies born with low
   birth weights can be attributed to women delaying childbearing and the
   increased use of fertility drugs.^[95]^[96]

System efficiency and equity[edit]

   Variations in the efficiency of health care delivery can cause
   variations in outcomes. The Dartmouth Atlas Project, for instance,
   reported that, for over 20 years, marked variations in how medical
   resources are distributed and used in the United States were
   accompanied by marked variations in outcomes.^[97] The willingness of
   physicians to work in an area varies with the income of the area and
   the amenities it offers, a situation aggravated by a general shortage
   of doctors in the United States, particularly those who offer primary
   care. The Affordable Care Act, if implemented, will produce an
   additional demand for services which the existing stable of primary
   care doctors will be unable to fill, particularly in economically
   depressed areas. Training additional physicians would require some
   years.^[98]

   Lean manufacturing techniques such as value stream mapping can help
   identify and subsequently mitigate waste associated with costs of
   healthcare.^[99] Other product engineering tools such as FMEA and Fish
   Bone Diagrams have been used to improve efficiencies in healthcare
   delivery.^[100]

Efficiency[edit]

Preventable deaths[edit]

   In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic
   obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most
   years of life lost in the US. Low back pain, depression,
   musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years
   lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet,
   tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar,
   physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse,
   kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years
   of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.^[4]

   Between 1990 and 2010, among the 34 countries in the OECD, the US
   dropped from 18th to 27th in age-standardized death rate. The US
   dropped from 23rd to 28th for age-standardized years of life lost. It
   dropped from 20th to 27th in life expectancy at birth. It dropped from
   14th to 26th for healthy life expectancy.^[4]

   According to a 2009 study conducted at Harvard Medical School and
   published by the American Journal of Public Health, lack of health
   coverage is associated with nearly 45,000 excess preventable deaths
   annually.^[8]^[101] Since then, as the number of uninsured has risen
   from about 46 million in 2009 to 48.6 million in 2012, the number of
   preventable deaths due to lack of insurance has grown to about 48,000
   per year.^[9]

Value for money[edit]

   A study of international health care spending levels published in the
   health policy journal Health Affairs in the year 2000 found that the
   United States spends substantially more on health care than any other
   country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
   (OECD), and that the use of health care services in the U.S. is below
   the OECD median by most measures. The authors of the study conclude
   that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the
   U.S. than elsewhere.^[102] While the 19 next most wealthy countries by
   GDP all pay less than half what the U.S. does for health care, they
   have all gained about six years of life expectancy more than the U.S.
   since 1970.^[79]

Delays in seeking care and increased use of emergency care[edit]

   Uninsured Americans are less likely to have regular health care and use
   preventive services. They are more likely to delay seeking care,
   resulting in more medical crises, which are more expensive than ongoing
   treatment for such conditions as diabetes and high blood pressure. A
   2007 study published in JAMA concluded that uninsured people were less
   likely than the insured to receive any medical care after an accidental
   injury or the onset of a new chronic condition. The uninsured with an
   injury were also twice as likely as those with insurance to have
   received none of the recommended follow-up care, and a similar pattern
   held for those with a new chronic condition.^[103] Uninsured patients
   are twice as likely to visit hospital emergency rooms as those with
   insurance; burdening a system meant for true emergencies with
   less-urgent care needs.^[104]

   In 2008 researchers with the American Cancer Society found that
   individuals who lacked private insurance (including those covered by
   Medicaid) were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer than
   those who had such insurance.^[105]

Shared costs of the uninsured[edit]

   Main article: Uninsured in the United States

   The costs of treating the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers
   as charity care, passed on to the insured via cost shifting and higher
   health insurance premiums, or paid by taxpayers through higher
   taxes.^[106] However, hospitals and other providers are reimbursed for
   the cost of providing uncompensated care via a federal matching fund
   program. Each state enacts legislation governing the reimbursement of
   funds to providers. In Missouri, for example, providers assessments
   totaling $800 million are matched – $2 for each assessed $1 – to create
   a pool of approximately $2 billion. By federal law these funds are
   transferred to the Missouri Hospital Association for disbursement to
   hospitals for the costs incurred providing uncompenstated care
   including Disproportionate Share Payments (to hospitals with high
   quantities of uninsured patients), Medicaid shortfalls, Medicaid
   managed care payments to insurance companies and other costs incurred
   by hospitals.^[107] In New Hampshire, by statute, reimbursable
   uncompensated care costs shall include: charity care costs, any portion
   of Medicaid patient care costs that are unreimbursed by Medicaid
   payments, and any portion of bad debt costs that the commissioner
   determines would meet the criteria under 42 U.S.C. section 1396r-4(g)
   governing hospital-specific limits on disproportionate share hospital
   payments under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.^[108]

   A report published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2008 found
   that economic downturns place a significant strain on state Medicaid
   and SCHIP programs. The authors estimated that a 1% increase in the
   unemployment rate would increase Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by
   1 million, and increase the number uninsured by 1.1 million. State
   spending on Medicaid and SCHIP would increase by $1.4 billion (total
   spending on these programs would increase by $3.4 billion). This
   increased spending would occur at the same time state government
   revenues were declining. During the last downturn, the Jobs and Growth
   Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) included federal
   assistance to states, which helped states avoid tightening their
   Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility rules. The authors conclude that
   Congress should consider similar relief for the current economic
   downturn.^[109]

Variations in provider practices[edit]

   The treatment given to a patient can vary significantly depending on
   which health care providers they use. Research suggests that some
   cost-effective treatments are not used as often as they should be,
   while overutilization occurs with other health care services.
   Unnecessary treatments increase costs and can cause patients
   unnecessary anxiety.^[110] The use of prescription drugs varies
   significantly by geographic region.^[111] The overuse of medical
   benefits is known as moral hazard – individuals who are insured are
   then more inclined to consume health care. The way the Health care
   system tries to eliminate this problem is through cost sharing tactics
   like co-pays and deductibles. If patients face more of the economic
   burden they will then only consume health care when it is necessary.
   According to the RAND health insurance experiment, individuals with
   higher Coinsurance rates consumed less health care than those with
   lower rates. The experiment concluded that with less consumption of
   care there was generally no loss in societal welfare but, for the
   poorer and sicker groups of people there were definitely negative
   effects. These patients were forced to forgo necessary preventative
   care measures in order to save money leading to late diagnosis of
   easily treated diseases and more expensive procedures later. With less
   preventative care, the patient is hurt financially with an increase in
   expensive visits to the ER.The Health Care costs in the U.S will also
   rise with these procedures as well. More expensive procedures lead to
   greater costs.^[112]^[113]

   One study has found significant geographic variations in Medicare
   spending for patients in the last two years of life. These spending
   levels are associated with the amount of hospital capacity available in
   each area. Higher spending did not result in patients living
   longer.^[114]^[115]

Care coordination[edit]

   Primary care doctors are often the point of entry for most patients
   needing care, but in the fragmented health care system of the U.S.,
   many patients and their providers experience problems with care
   coordination. For example, a Harris Interactive survey of California
   physicians found that:
     * Four of every ten physicians report that their patients have had
       problems with coordination of their care in the last 12 months.
     * More than 60% of doctors report that their patients "sometimes" or
       "often" experience long wait times for diagnostic tests.
     * Some 20% of doctors report having their patients repeat tests
       because of an inability to locate the results during a scheduled
       visit.^[116]

   According to an article in The New York Times, the relationship between
   doctors and patients is deteriorating.^[117] A study from Johns Hopkins
   University found that roughly one in four patients believe their
   doctors have exposed them to unnecessary risks, and anecdotal evidence
   such as self-help books and web postings suggest increasing patient
   frustration. Possible factors behind the deteriorating doctor/patient
   relationship include the current system for training physicians and
   differences in how doctors and patients view the practice of medicine.
   Doctors may focus on diagnosis and treatment, while patients may be
   more interested in wellness and being listened to by their
   doctors.^[117]

   Many primary care physicians no longer see their patients while they
   are in the hospital. Instead, hospitalists are used, which fragments
   care because hospitalists usually have had no previous relationship
   with the patient they are treating and do not have a personal knowledge
   of the patient's medical history.^[118]^[119] The use of hospitalists
   is sometimes mandated by health insurance companies as a cost-saving
   measure which is resented by some primary care physicians.^[120]

Administrative costs[edit]

   The health care system in the U.S. has a vast number of players. There
   are hundreds, if not thousands, of insurance companies in the
   U.S.^[121]^[122] This system has considerable administrative overhead,
   far greater than in nationalized, single-payer systems, such as
   Canada's. An oft-cited study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian
   Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of U.S.
   health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to
   health care administrative costs, nearly double the administrative
   overhead in Canada, on a percentage basis.^[123]

   According to the insurance industry group America's Health Insurance
   Plans, administrative costs for private health insurance plans have
   averaged approximately 12% of premiums over the last 40 years. There
   has been a shift in the type and distribution of administrative
   expenses over that period. The cost of adjudicating claims has fallen,
   while insurers are spending more on other administrative activities,
   such as medical management, nurse help lines, and negotiating
   discounted fees with health care providers.^[124]

   A 2003 study published by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association
   (BCBSA) also found that health insurer administrative costs were
   approximately 11% to 12% of premiums, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield
   plans reporting slightly lower administrative costs, on average, than
   commercial insurers.^[125] For the period 1998 through 2003, average
   insurer administrative costs declined from 12.9% to 11.6% of premiums.
   The largest increases in administrative costs were in customer service
   and information technology, and the largest decreases were in provider
   services and contracting and in general administration.^[126] The
   McKinsey Global Institute estimated that excess spending on "health
   administration and insurance" accounted for as much as 21% of the
   estimated total excess spending ($477 billion in 2003).^[127]

   According to a report published by the CBO in 2008, administrative
   costs for private insurance represent approximately 12% of premiums.
   Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely
   attributable to economies of scale. Coverage for large employers has
   the lowest administrative costs. The percentage of premium attributable
   to administration increases for smaller firms, and is highest for
   individually purchased coverage.^[128] A 2009 study published by BCBSA
   found that the average administrative expense cost for all commercial
   health insurance products was represented 9.18% of premiums in
   2008.^[129] Administrative costs were 11.12% of premiums for small
   group products and 16.35% in the individual market.^[129]

   One study of the billing and insurance-related (BIR) costs borne not
   only by insurers but also by physicians and hospitals found that BIR
   among insurers, physicians, and hospitals in California represented
   20–22% of privately insured spending in California acute care
   settings.^[130]

Third-party payment problem and consumer-driven insurance[edit]

   Most Americans pay for medical services largely through insurance, and
   this can distort the incentives of consumers since the consumer pays
   only a portion of the ultimate cost directly.^[48] The lack of price
   information on medical services can also distort incentives.^[48] The
   insurance which pays on behalf of insureds negotiate with medical
   providers, sometimes using government-established prices such as
   Medicaid billing rates as a reference point.^[48] This reasoning has
   led for calls to reform the insurance system to create a
   consumer-driven health care system whereby consumers pay more
   out-of-pocket.^[131] In 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
   Improvement, and Modernization Act was passed, which encourages
   consumers to have a high-deductible health plan and a health savings
   account.

Overall costs[edit]

   U.S. Healthcare Costs as a Percentage of GDP 2000–2011
   U.S. Healthcare Costs per Capita 2000–2011

   The U.S. spends more as a percentage of GDP than similar countries, and
   this can be explained either through higher prices for services
   themselves, higher costs to administer the system, or more utilization
   of these services, or to a combination of these elements.^[132]

   Free-market advocates claim that the health care system is
   "dysfunctional" because the system of third-party payments from
   insurers removes the patient as a major participant in the financial
   and medical choices that affect costs. The Cato Institute claims that
   because government intervention has expanded insurance availability
   through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, this has exacerbated
   the problem.^[133] According to a study paid for by America's Health
   Insurance Plans (a Washington lobbyist for the health insurance
   industry) and carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, increased
   utilization is the primary driver of rising health care costs in the
   U.S.^[134] The study cites numerous causes of increased utilization,
   including rising consumer demand, new treatments, more intensive
   diagnostic testing, lifestyle factors, the movement to broader-access
   plans, and higher-priced technologies.^[134] The study also mentions
   cost-shifting from government programs to private payers. Low
   reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid have increased
   cost-shifting pressures on hospitals and doctors, who charge higher
   rates for the same services to private payers, which eventually affects
   health insurance rates.^[135]

   Health care costs rising far faster than inflation have been a major
   driver for health care reform in the United States. Surgical, injury,
   and maternal and neonatal health hospital visit costs increased by more
   than 2% each year from 2003-2011. Further, while average hospital
   discharges remained stable, hospital costs rost from $9,100 in 2003 to
   $10,600 in 2011, and were projected to be $11,000 by 2013.^[136]

   In March 2010, Massachusetts released a report on the cost drivers
   which it called "unique in the nation".^[137] The report noted that
   providers and insurers negotiate privately, and therefore the prices
   can vary between providers and insurers for the same services, and it
   found that the variation in prices did not vary based on quality of
   care but rather on market leverage; the report also found that price
   increases rather than increased utilization explained the spending
   increases in the past several years.^[137]

Equity[edit]

Coverage[edit]

   Enrollment rules in private and governmental programs result in
   millions of Americans going without health care coverage, including
   children. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 45.7 million Americans
   (15.3% of the total population) had no health insurance coverage in
   2007.^[46] However, statistics regarding the insured population are
   difficult to pinpoint for a number of factors, with the Census Bureau
   writing that "health insurance coverage is likely to be
   underreported".^[138] Further, such statistics do not provide insight
   into the reason a given person might be uninsured. Studies have shown
   that approximately one third of this 45.7 million person population of
   uninsured persons is actually eligible for government insurance
   programmes such as Medicaid/Medicare, but has elected not to enroll.
   The largest proportion of the population of uninsured Americans is
   persons earning in excess of $50,000 per annum, with those earning over
   $75,000 p.a. comprising the fastest-growing segment of the uninsured
   population. U.S. Citizens who earn too much money to qualify for
   government assistance with insurance programs but who do not earn
   enough to purchase a private health insurance plan make up
   approximately 2.7% percent of the total US population (8.2 million of
   approximately 300 million total population, by 2003 figures).^[139]

   States like California offer insurance coverage for children of low
   income families, but not for adults; other states do not offer such
   coverage at all: both parent and child are caught in the notorious
   coverage "gap." Although EMTALA^[140] certainly keeps alive many
   working-class people who are badly injured, the 1986 law neither
   requires the provision of preventive or rehabilitative care, nor
   subsidizes such care, and it does nothing about the difficulties in the
   American mental health system.

   Coverage gaps also occur among the insured population. Johns Hopkins
   University professor Vicente Navarro stated in 2003, "the problem does
   not end here, with the uninsured. An even larger problem is the
   underinsured" and "The most credible estimate of the number of people
   in the United States who have died because of lack of medical care was
   provided by a study carried out by Harvard Medical School Professors
   Himmelstein and Woolhandler.^[141] They concluded that almost 100,000
   people died in the U.S. yearly because of lack of needed care."^[142]
   Another study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs
   estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The
   study defined underinsurance as characterized by at least one of the
   following conditions: annual out-of-pocket medical expenses totaling
   10% or more of income, or 5% or more among adults with incomes below
   200% of the federal poverty level; or health plan deductibles equaling
   or exceeding 5% of income. The underinsured were significantly more
   likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report
   financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps
   for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that
   underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes —
   73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes
   below 200% of the federal poverty level.^[143] Another study focusing
   on the effect of being uninsured found that individuals with private
   insurance were less likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer than
   either the uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries.^[105] A study examining
   the effects of health insurance cost-sharing more generally found that
   chronically ill patients with higher co-payments sought less care for
   both minor and serious symptoms while no effect on self-reported health
   status was observed. The authors concluded that the effect of cost
   sharing should be carefully monitored.^[144]

   Coverage gaps and affordability also surfaced in a 2007 international
   comparison by the Commonwealth Fund. Among adults surveyed in the U.S.,
   37% reported that they had foregone needed medical care in the previous
   year because of cost; either skipping medications, avoiding seeing a
   doctor when sick, or avoiding other recommended care. The rate was
   higher — 42% — among those with chronic conditions. The study reported
   that these rates were well above those found in the other six countries
   surveyed: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and
   the UK.^[145] The study also found that 19% of U.S. adults surveyed
   reported serious problems paying medical bills, more than double the
   rate in the next highest country.

Mental health[edit]

   See also: Emotional mental health in the United States

   A lack of mental health coverage for Americans bears significant
   ramifications to the U.S. economy and social system. A report by the
   U.S. Surgeon General found that mental illnesses are the second leading
   cause of disability in the nation and affect 20% of all
   Americans.^[146] It is estimated that less than half of all people with
   mental illnesses receive treatment (or specifically, an ongoing, much
   needed, and managed care; where medication alone, cannot easily remove
   mental conditions) due to factors such as stigma and lack of access to
   care.^[147]

   The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2008
   mandates that group health plans provide mental health and
   substance-related disorder benefits that are at least equivalent to
   benefits offered for medical and surgical procedures. The legislation
   renews and expands provisions of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996.
   The law requires financial equity for annual and lifetime mental health
   benefits, and compels parity in treatment limits and expands all equity
   provisions to addiction services. Insurance companies and third-party
   disability administrators (most notably, Sedgwick CMS) used loopholes
   and, though providing financial equity, they often worked around the
   law by applying unequal co-payments or setting limits on the number of
   days spent in inpatient or outpatient treatment facilities.^[148]^[149]

Medical underwriting and the uninsurable[edit]

   In most states in the U.S., people seeking to purchase health insurance
   directly must undergo medical underwriting. Insurance companies seeking
   to mitigate the problem of adverse selection and manage their risk
   pools screen applicants for pre-existing conditions. Insurers reject
   many applicants or quote increased rates for those with pre-existing
   conditions. Diseases that can make an individual uninsurable include
   serious conditions, such as arthritis, cancer, and heart disease, but
   also such common ailments as acne, being 20 pounds over or under
   weight, and old sports injuries.^[150] An estimated 5 million of those
   without health insurance are considered "uninsurable" because of
   pre-existing conditions.^[151]

   Proponents of medical underwriting argue that it ensures that
   individual health insurance premiums are kept as low as possible.^[152]
   Critics of medical underwriting believe that it unfairly prevents
   people with relatively minor and treatable pre-existing conditions from
   obtaining health insurance.^[153]

   One large industry survey found that 13% of applicants for individual
   health insurance who went through medical underwriting were denied
   coverage in 2004. Declination rates increased significantly with age,
   rising from 5% for those under 18 to just under one-third for those
   aged 60 to 64.^[154] Among those who were offered coverage, the study
   found that 76% received offers at standard premium rates, and 22% were
   offered higher rates.^[155] The frequency of increased premiums also
   increased with age, so for applicants over 40, roughly half were
   affected by medical underwriting, either in the form of denial or
   increased premiums. In contrast, almost 90% of applicants in their 20s
   were offered coverage, and three-quarters of those were offered
   standard rates. Seventy percent of applicants age 60–64 were offered
   coverage, but almost half the time (40%) it was at an increased
   premium. The study did not address how many applicants who were offered
   coverage at increased rates chose to decline the policy. A study
   conducted by the Commonwealth Fund in 2001 found that, among those aged
   19 to 64 who sought individual health insurance during the previous
   three years, the majority found it unaffordable, and less than a third
   ended up purchasing insurance. This study did not distinguish between
   consumers who were quoted increased rates due to medical underwriting
   and those who qualified for standard or preferred premiums.^[156] Some
   states have outlawed medical underwriting as a prerequisite for
   individually purchased health coverage.^[157] These states tend to have
   the highest premiums for individual health insurance.^[158]

Demographic differences[edit]

   Main articles: Health disparities and Race and health

   Health disparities are well documented in the U.S. in ethnic minorities
   such as African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics.^[159] When
   compared to whites, these minority groups have higher incidence of
   chronic diseases, higher mortality, and poorer health outcomes. Among
   the disease-specific examples of racial and ethnic disparities in the
   United States is the cancer incidence rate among African Americans,
   which is 25% higher than among whites.^[160] In addition, adult African
   Americans and Hispanics have approximately twice the risk as whites of
   developing diabetes and have higher overall obesity rates.^[161]
   Minorities also have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and
   HIV/AIDS than whites.^[160] Caucasian Americans have much lower life
   expectancy than Asian Americans.^[162] A 2001 study found large racial
   differences exist in healthy life expectancy at lower levels of
   education.^[163]

   Public spending is highly correlated with age; average per capita
   public spending for seniors was more than five times that for children
   ($6,921 versus $1,225). Average public spending for non-Hispanic blacks
   ($2,973) was slightly higher than that for whites ($2,675), while
   spending for Hispanics ($1,967) was significantly lower than the
   population average ($2,612). Total public spending is also strongly
   correlated with self-reported health status ($13,770 for those
   reporting "poor" health versus $1,279 for those reporting "excellent"
   health).^[47] Seniors comprise 13% of the population but take 1/3 of
   all prescription drugs. The average senior fills 38 prescriptions
   annually.^[164] A new study has also found that older men and women in
   the South are more often prescribed antibiotics than older Americans
   elsewhere, even though there is no evidence that the South has higher
   rates of diseases requiring antibiotics.^[165]

   There is considerable research into inequalities in health care. In
   some cases these inequalities are caused by income disparities that
   result in lack of health insurance and other barriers to receiving
   services.^[166] According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities
   Report, uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive
   services in health care.^[167] For example, minorities are not
   regularly screened for colon cancer and the death rate for colon cancer
   has increased among African Americans and Hispanic people. In other
   cases, inequalities in health care reflect a systemic bias in the way
   medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic
   groups. Raj Bhopal writes that the history of racism in science and
   medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the
   ethos of their times.^[168] Nancy Krieger wrote that racism underlies
   unexplained inequities in health care, including treatment for heart
   disease,^[169] renal failure,^[170] bladder cancer,^[171] and
   pneumonia.^[172] Raj Bhopal writes that these inequalities have been
   documented in numerous studies. The consistent and repeated findings
   were that black Americans received less health care than white
   Americans – particularly when the care involved expensive new
   technology.^[173] One recent study has found that when minority and
   white patients use the same hospital, they are given the same standard
   of care.^[174]^[175]

Drug efficiency and safety[edit]

   See also: Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States

   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)^[176] is the primary institution
   tasked with the safety and effectiveness of human and veterinary drugs.
   It also is responsible for making sure drug information is accurately
   and informatively presented to the public. The FDA reviews and approves
   products and establishes drug labeling, drug standards, and medical
   device manufacturing standards. It sets performance standards for
   radiation and ultrasonic equipment.

   One of the more contentious issues related to drug safety is immunity
   from prosecution. In 2004, the FDA reversed a federal policy, arguing
   that FDA premarket approval overrides most claims for damages under
   state law for medical devices. In 2008 this was confirmed by the
   Supreme Court in Riegel v. Medtronic.^[177]

   On 30 June 2006, an FDA ruling went into effect extending protection
   from lawsuits to pharmaceutical manufacturers, even if it was found
   that they submitted fraudulent clinical trial data to the FDA in their
   quest for approval. This left consumers who experience serious health
   consequences from drug use with little recourse. In 2007, opposition
   was raised in the Congressional House to the FDA ruling, but the Senate
   upheld the status quo. On 4 March 2009, an important U.S. Supreme Court
   decision was handed down. In Wyeth v. Levine, the court asserted that
   state-level rights of action could not be pre-empted by federal
   immunity and could provide "appropriate relief for injured
   consumers."^[178] In June 2009, under the Public Readiness and
   Emergency Preparedness Act, Secretary of Health and Human Services
   Kathleen Sebelius signed an order extending protection to vaccine
   makers and federal officials from prosecution during a declared health
   emergency related to the administration of the swine flu
   vaccine.^[179]^[180]

Impact of drug companies[edit]

   The U.S. is one of two countries in the world that allows
   direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. Critics note that
   drug advertisements cost money which they believe have raised the
   overall price of drugs.^[181]

   When health care legislation was being written in 2009, the drug
   companies were asked to support the legislation in return for not
   allowing importation of drugs from foreign countries.^[182]

Political issues[edit]

Prescription drug prices[edit]

   The following text needs to be harmonized with text in Prescription
   drug prices in the United States.
   Main article: Prescription drug prices in the United States

   During the 1990s, the price of prescription drugs became a major issue
   in American politics as the prices of many new drugs increased
   exponentially, and many citizens discovered that neither the government
   nor their insurer would cover the cost of such drugs. Per capita, the
   U.S. spends more on pharmaceuticals than any other country. National
   expenditures on pharmaceuticals accounted for 12.9% of total health
   care costs, compared to an OECD average of 17.7% (2003 figures).^[183]
   Some 25% of out-of-pocket spending by individuals is for prescription
   drugs.^[184]

   The U.S. government has taken the position (through the Office of the
   United States Trade Representative) that U.S. drug prices are rising
   because U.S. consumers are effectively subsidizing costs which drug
   companies cannot recover from consumers in other countries (because
   many other countries use their bulk-purchasing power to aggressively
   negotiate drug prices).^[185] The U.S. position (consistent with the
   primary lobbying position of the Pharmaceutical Research and
   Manufacturers of America) is that the governments of such countries are
   free riding on the backs of U.S. consumers. Such governments should
   either deregulate their markets, or raise their domestic taxes in order
   to fairly compensate U.S. consumers by directly remitting the
   difference (between what the companies would earn in an open market
   versus what they are earning now) to drug companies or to the U.S.
   government. In turn, pharmaceutical companies would be able to continue
   to produce innovative pharmaceuticals while lowering prices for U.S.
   consumers. Currently, the U.S., as a purchaser of pharmaceuticals,
   negotiates some drug prices but is forbidden by law from negotiating
   drug prices for the Medicare program due to the Medicare Prescription
   Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act passed in 2003. Democrats have
   charged that the purpose of this provision is merely to allow the
   pharmaceutical industry to profiteer off of the Medicare program, which
   is already in imminent danger of becoming financially insolvent.^[186]

Debate[edit]

   Main article: Health care reform in the United States

   A poll released in March 2008 by the Harvard School of Public Health
   and Harris Interactive found that Americans are divided in their views
   of the U.S. health system, and that there are significant differences
   by political affiliation. When asked whether the U.S. has the best
   health care system or if other countries have better systems, 45% said
   that the U.S. system was best and 39% said that other countries'
   systems are better. Belief that the U.S. system is best was highest
   among Republicans (68%), lower among independents (40%), and lowest
   among Democrats (32%). Over half of Democrats (56%) said they would be
   more likely to support a presidential candidate who advocates making
   the U.S. system more like those of other countries; 37% of independents
   and 19% of Republicans said they would be more likely to support such a
   candidate. 45% of Republicans said that they would be less likely to
   support such a candidate, compared to 17% of independents and 7% of
   Democrats.^[187]^[188]

   A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report said, "the United States is
   among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not
   guarantee access to health care for its population."^[30] There is
   currently an ongoing political debate centering around questions of
   access, efficiency, quality, and sustainability. Whether a
   government-mandated system of universal health care should be
   implemented in the U.S. remains a hotly debated political topic, with
   Americans divided along party lines in their views of the U.S. health
   system and what should be done to improve it. Those in favor of
   universal health care argue that the large number of uninsured
   Americans creates direct and hidden costs shared by all, and that
   extending coverage to all would lower costs and improve quality.^[189]
   Cato Institute Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds argues that people should be
   free to opt out of health insurance, citing a study by Economists Craig
   Perry and Harvey Rosen that found "the lack of health insurance among
   the self-employed does not affect their health. For virtually every
   subjective and objective measure of their health status, the
   self-employed and wage-earners are statistically indistinguishable for
   each other."^[190] Both sides of the political spectrum have also
   looked to more philosophical arguments,^[citation needed] debating
   whether people have a fundamental right to have health care provided to
   them by their government.^[191]^[192]

   An impediment to implementing any U.S. healthcare reform that does not
   benefit insurance companies or the private health care industry is the
   power of insurance company and health care industry
   lobbyists.^[193]^[194] Possibly as a consequence of the power of
   lobbyists, key politicians such as Senator Max Baucus have taken the
   option of single payer health care off the table entirely.^[195] In a
   June 2009 NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, 76% said it was either
   "extremely" or "quite" important to "give people a choice of both a
   public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan
   for their health insurance."^[196]

   Advocates for single-payer health care often point to other countries,
   where national government-funded systems produce better health outcomes
   at lower cost. Opponents deride this type of system as "socialized
   medicine", and it has not been one of the favored reform options by
   Congress or the President in both the Clinton and Obama reform
   efforts.^[197]^[198] It has been pointed out that socialized medicine
   is a system in which the government owns the means of providing
   medicine. England is an example of socialized system, as, in America,
   is the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare is an example of a
   mostly single-payer system, as is France. Both of these systems have
   private insurers to choose from, but the government is the dominant
   purchaser.^[199]

   As an example of how government intervention has had unintended
   consequences, in 1973, the federal government passed the Health
   Maintenance Organization Act, which heavily subsidized the HMO business
   model – a model that was in decline prior to such legislative
   intervention. The law was intended to create market incentives that
   would lower health care costs, but HMOs have never achieved their
   cost-reduction potential.^[200]

   Piecemeal market-based reform efforts are complex. One study evaluating
   current popular market-based reform policy packages concluded that if
   market-oriented reforms are not implemented on a systematic basis with
   appropriate safeguards, they have the potential to cause more problems
   than they solve.^[201]

   According to economist and former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert
   Reich, only a "big, national, public option" can force insurance
   companies to cooperate, share information, and reduce costs. Scattered,
   localized, "insurance cooperatives" are too small to do that and are
   "designed to fail" by the moneyed forces opposing Democratic health
   care reform.^[202]^[203] The Patient Protection and Affordable Care
   Act, signed into law in March, 2010, did not include such an option.

Reform[edit]

   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) is
   a health care reform bill that was signed into law in the United States
   by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Along with the Health Care
   and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (passed March 25), the Act is
   a product of the health care reform agenda of the Democratic 111th
   Congress and the Obama administration.

   The law includes a large number of health-related provisions to take
   effect over the next four years, including expanding Medicaid
   eligibility for people making up to 133% of FPL,^[204] subsidizing
   insurance premiums for peoples making up to 400% of FPL ($88,000 for
   family of 4) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" pay will be from 2% to
   9.8% of income for annual premium,^[205]^[206] providing incentives for
   businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of
   coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions,
   establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting insurers from
   establishing annual spending caps and support for medical research. The
   costs of these provisions are offset by a variety of taxes, fees, and
   cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for high-income
   brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage
   program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices
   and pharmaceutical companies;^[207] there is also a tax penalty for
   citizens who do not obtain health insurance (unless they are exempt due
   to low income or other reasons).^[208] The Congressional Budget Office
   estimates that the net effect (including the reconciliation act) will
   be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first
   decade.^[209]

   In May 2011, the state of Vermont became the first state to pass
   legislation establishing a Single-Payer health care system. The
   legislation, known as Act 48, establishes health care in the state as a
   "human right" and lays the responsibility on the state to provide a
   health care system which best meets the needs of the citizens of
   Vermont. The state is currently in the studying phase of how best to
   implement this system.^[citation needed]

Health Insurance Coverage for Immigrants[edit]

   Of the 26.2 million foreign immigrants living in the US in 1998, 62.9%
   were non-U.S. citizens. In 1997, 34.3% of non-U.S. citizens living in
   America did not have health insurance coverage opposed to the 14.2% of
   native-born Americans who do not have health insurance coverage. Among
   those immigrants who became citizens, 18.5% were uninsured, as opposed
   to noncitizens, who are 43.6% uninsured. In each age and income group,
   immigrants are less likely to have health insurance.^[210] With the
   recent healthcare changes, many legal immigrants with various
   immigration statuses now are able qualify for affordable health
   insurance.^[211]

Health Insurance Coverage for Visitors to the U.S.[edit]

   Visitors to the U.S. cannot purchase health insurance that is available
   for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Most domestic insurance
   policies purchased overseas cease to be effective inside the U.S., when
   individuals cross their home country borders during international
   travel. Currently, it is not mandatory for short-term visitors to U.S.
   to provide proof of travel medical insurance coverage to obtain a legal
   visa to enter the U.S. However, considering cost of healthcare for the
   uninsured in the U.S., many foreigners without residence in the U.S.,
   and visiting the U.S. can benefit by buying a visitors health insurance
   protection plan that covers emergency expenses such as medical
   evacuation and treatment for sickness or injuries while in the
   U.S.^[212]
