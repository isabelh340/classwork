   Household income is an economic measure that can be applied to one
   household, or aggregated across a large group such as a county, city,
   or the whole country. It is commonly used by the United States
   government and private institutions to describe a household's economic
   status or to track economic trends in the US.

   The distribution of household incomes has become more unequal during
   the post-2008 economic recovery, a first for the US but in line with
   the trend over the last ten economic recoveries since 1949.^[1]^[2]
   Income inequality in the United States has grown from 2005 to 2012 in
   more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas.^[3]

Definition[edit]

   A household's income can be calculated various ways but the US Census
   as of 2009 measured it the following way: the income of every resident
   over the age of 15, including wages and salaries, unemployment
   insurance, disability payments, child support payments received,
   regular rental receipts, as well as any personal business, investment,
   or other kinds of income received routinely.^[4]

   The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of
   the household for their earnings to be considered part of the
   household's income.^[5] As households tend to share a similar economic
   context, the use of household income remains among the most widely
   accepted measures of income. That the size of a household is not
   commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis
   of fluctuations within or among the household income categories, and
   may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even
   impossible.^[6]

Uses[edit]

   Use of individual household income: The government and organizations
   may look at one particular household's income to decide if a person is
   eligible for certain programs, such as nutrition assistance ^[7] or
   need-based financial aid,^[8] among many others.

   Use at the aggregate level: Summaries of household incomes across
   groups of people - often the entire country- are also studied as part
   of economic trends like standard of living and distribution of income
   and wealth. Household income as an economic measure can be represented
   as a median, a mean, a distribution, and other ways. Household income
   can be studied across time, region, education level, race/ethnicity,
   and many other dimensions. As an indicator of economic trends, it may
   be studied along with related economic measures such as disposable
   income, debt, household net worth (which includes debt and investments,
   durable goods like cars and houses), wealth, and employment statistics.

Quintiles[edit]

   Households are often divided into quintiles according to their gross
   income. Each quintile represents 20%, or one fifth, of all households.

   Household type is strongly correlated with household income. Married
   couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles,
   compared to the general population of households. Cross-referencing
   shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income
   earners in these families. Non-family households (individuals) are
   disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles. Households
   headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three
   quintiles; single females head households concentrated in the bottom
   three quintiles.

   The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own
   their homes rather than rent, but in the lowest quintile, the ratio of
   owners to renters is nearly one to one.

   The New York Times has used the quintiles to define class. It has
   assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as bottom fifth, lower
   middle, middle, upper middle, and top fifth.^[10]

Median inflation-adjusted ("real") household income[edit]

   Median inflation-adjusted ("real") household income generally increases
   and decreases with the business cycle, declining in each year during
   the periods 1979 through 1983, 1990 through 1993, 2000 through 2004 and
   2008 through 2012, while rising in each of the intervening years.^[12]
   Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less
   than $2 per day before government benefits, more than doubled from
   636,000 to 1.46 million households (including 2.8 million children)
   between 1996 and 2011.^[13]

Median Household Income over Time[edit]

After 2010[edit]

   The 2011 Median Income of US households was $50,054 per annum.^[14]
   This graph shows the distribution of annual household income in the
   United States in 2012. The last two columns look larger because they
   show a much larger range of income than the preceding columns.

Before 2010[edit]

   In 2006, the "real" (adjusted for inflation) median annual household
   income rose 1.3% to $50,233.00 according to the Census Bureau.^[15] The
   real median earnings of men who worked full-time, year-round climbed
   between 2006 and 2007, from $43,460 to $45,113 (about 3.6 times minimum
   wage in 2006 to 3.7 times minimum wage in 2007). For women, the
   corresponding increase was from $33,437 to $35,102 (2.8 and 2.9 times
   minimum wage respectively). The median income per household member
   (including all working and non-working members above the age of 14) was
   $26,036 in 2006.^[16]

   In 2006, there were approximately 116,011,000 households in the United
   States. The percent of all households had annual incomes exceeding
   $250,000 was 1.93% .^[17] About 12.3% fell below the federal poverty
   threshold^[18] and the bottom 20% earned less than $19,178.^[19] The
   aggregate income distribution is highly concentrated towards the top,
   with the top 6.37% earning roughly one third of all income, and those
   with upper-middle incomes controlling a large, though declining, share
   of the total earned income.^[6]^[20]

   Income inequality in the United States, which had decreased slowly
   after World War II until 1970, began to increase in the 1970s until
   reaching a peak in 2006. It declined a little in 2007.^[21] Households
   in the top quintile (i.e., top 20%), 77% of which had two or more
   income earners, had incomes exceeding $91,705. Households in the mid
   quintile, most of which had one income earner per household, had
   incomes between $36,000 and $57,607. Households in the lowest quintile
   had incomes less than $19,178 and the majority had no income
   earner.^[22]

   The 2006 economic survey also found that households in the top two
   income quintiles, those with an annual household income exceeding
   $60,000, had a median of two income earners while those in the lower
   quintiles (2nd and middle quintile) had median of only one income
   earner per household. Overall, the United States followed the trend of
   other developed nations with a relatively large population of
   relatively affluent households outnumbering the poor. Among those in
   between the extremes of the income strata are a large number of
   households with moderately high middle class incomes^[20] and an even
   larger number of households with moderately low incomes.^[17]

   While the median household income had increased 30% from 1990 to 2006,
   it has increased only slightly when considering inflation.^[17] In
   1990, the median annual household income was $30,056 or $44,603 in 2003
   dollars. While personal income has remained relatively stagnant over
   the past few decades, household income has risen due to the rising
   percentage of households with two or more income earners. Between 1999
   and 2004 household income stagnated showing a slight increase since
   2004.^[23]^[24]
   This graph shows the income of the given percentiles from 1967 to 2003,
   in 2003 dollars.^[25]
   This graph shows the income of the given racial and ethnic groups, in
   2011 dollars.^[26]

   Since 1966, the median household income in the United States has risen
   by 31%, fluctuating several times. The rise in household income is
   largely the result of an increase in personal income among college
   graduates, a group that has doubled in size since the 1960s, and women
   entering the labor force. Today, 42% of all households have two income
   earners. Household income increased dramatically faster for affluent
   households with income inequality having increased steadily since the
   1970s.^[27]^[28]

   While household income has increased, its growth has been slowed by a
   decrease in married-couple households who tend to have two earners and,
   therefore, higher incomes. While the proportion of wives working
   year-round in married couple households with children has increased
   from 17% in 1967 to 39% in 1996, the proportion of such households
   among the general population has decreased. This means that the share
   the most economically prosperous type of household has been dwindling
   in the United States.^[29]

   In 1969, more than 40% of all households consisted of a married couple
   with children. By 1996 only a rough quarter of US households consisted
   of married couples with children. As a result of these changing
   household demographics, median household income rose relatively slowly
   despite an ever-increasing female labor force and a considerable
   increase in the percentage of college graduates.^[29]
   “ "From 1969 to 1996, median household income rose a very modest 6.3
     percent in constant dollars... The 1969 to 1996 stagnation in median
     household income may, in fact, be largely a reflection of changes in
     the size and composition of households rather than a reflection of a
     stagnating economy."- John McNeil, US Census Bureau                 ”

   Overall, the median household income rose from $33,338 in 1967 to an
   all-time high of $44,922 in 1999, and has since decreased slightly to
   $43,318. Decreases in household income are visible during each
   recession, while increases are visible during economic upturns. These
   fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both
   the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by fluctuations in the
   economy. Income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew considerably
   faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer
   households.^[25]^[29]

   For example the household income for the 80th precentile, the lower
   threshold for the top quintile, rose from $55,265 in 1967 to $86,867 in
   2003, a 57.2% increase. The median household income rose by 30% while
   the income for the 20th percentile (the lower threshold for the second
   lowest quintile) rose by only 28% from $14,002 to $17,984. As the
   majority of households in the top quintile had two income earners,
   versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between
   the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing
   household demographics including the addition of women to the
   workforce.^[25]^[29]

   Household demographics are not, however, the cause of the growing gap
   between the top 5% and the rest of the upper quintile. The top 5% had
   fewer dual earner households and full-time workers than the top
   quintile overall. In 2003 a household in the 95th percentile earned
   77.2% more than a household in the 80th percentile, compared to 60.5%
   in 1967, a 27.6% increase in the earnings increase discrepancy between
   the two groups. Overall the income of the 95th percentile grew 15.2%
   faster than that of the 80th, 146.8% faster than that of the median and
   159.9% faster than that of the 20th percentile.^[30]

   Households in the top 1% experienced the by far greatest increases in
   household income. According to economist Janet Yellen "the growth [in
   real income] was heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top, that
   is, the top 1 percent."^[31] A 2006 analysis of IRS income data by
   economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkeley and
   Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics showed that the share
   of income held by the top 1% was as large in 2005 as in 1928. The data
   revealed that reported income increased by 9% in 2005, with the mean
   for the top 1% increasing by 14% and that for the bottom 90% dropping
   slightly by 0.6%.^[32]

   While per-capita disposable income has increased 469% since 1972, it
   has only increased moderately when inflation is considered. In 1972,
   disposable personal income was determined to be $4,129; $19,385 in 2005
   dollars. In 2005, disposable personal income was, however, $27,640, a
   43% increase.^[33]^[34] Since the late 1990s, household income has
   fallen slightly.^[35]

   20th, 50th, 80th and 95th percentile from 1967 to 2011, in 2011

   The median household income in the United States was $44,389 as of
   2004.^[17]^[dead link] The median income divides households in the US
   evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the
   median income and half of all households earning less than the median
   household income. According to the US Census Bureau, the median is
   "considerably lower than the average, and provides a more accurate
   representation."^[37]

Mean household income[edit]

   Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household
   income. Unlike the median household income, which divides all
   households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned
   by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all
   households is divided by the number of all households.^[38] The mean
   income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution
   of income which tilts towards the top.^[37] As a result, the mean tends
   to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households
   boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States,
   according to the US Census Bureau 2004 Economic Survey, was $60,528, or
   $17,210 (39.73%) higher than the median household income.^[39]

   The US Census Bureau also provides a breakdown by self-identified
   ethnic groups as follows (as of March 2005):

   CAPTION: Mean Household Income by Ethnicity^[39]

    Ethnic Category   Mean Household Income
   Asian alone        $76,747
   White alone        $65,317
   Hispanic or Latino $45,871
   Black              $40,685

Mean vs Median Household income[edit]

     Median income is the amount which divides the income distribution
     into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and
     half having income below that amount. Mean income (average) is the
     amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by
     the number of units in that group. The means and medians for
     households and families are based on all households and families.
     Means and medians for people are based on people 15 years old and
     over with income.

     Gov.^[38]

Aggregate income distribution[edit]

   The aggregate income measures the combined income earned by all persons
   in a particular income group. In 2007, all households in the United
   States earned roughly $7.723 trillion.^[40] One half, 49.98%, of all
   income in the US was earned by households with an income over $100,000,
   the top twenty percent. Over one quarter, 28.5%, of all income was
   earned by the top 8%, those households earning more than $150,000 a
   year. The top 3.65%, with incomes over $200,000, earned 17.5%.
   Households with annual incomes from $50,000 to $75,000, 18.2% of
   households, earned 16.5% of all income. Households with annual incomes
   from $50,000 to $95,000, 28.1% of households, earned 28.8% of all
   income. The bottom 10.3% earned 1.06% of all income.

   personal and household income
   in the United States Census
   in 2005

   Despite advances minorities have made to exit poverty, there is still
   an uneven racial distribution among the income quintiles. While White
   Americans made up roughly 75.1% of all persons in 2000,^[41] 87.93% of
   all households in the top 5% were headed by a person who identified as
   being White alone. Only 4.75% of all household in the top 5% were
   headed by someone who identified him or herself as being Hispanic or
   Latino of any race,^[42] versus 12.5% of persons identifying themselves
   as Hispanic or Latino in the general population.^[41]

   Overall, 86.01% of all households in the top two quintiles with
   upper-middle range incomes of over $55,331 were headed by a head of
   household who identified him or herself as White alone, while only
   7.21% were being headed by someone who identified as being Hispanic and
   7.37% by someone who identified as being African American or
   Black.^[42] Overall, households headed by Hispanics and African
   Americans were underrepresented in the top two quintiles and
   overrepresented in the bottom two quintiles. Households headed by
   persons who identified as being Asian alone, on the other hand, were
   overrepresented among the top two quintiles. In the top five percent
   the percentage of Asians was nearly twice as high as the percentage of
   Asians among the general population. Whites were relatively even
   distributed throughout the quintiles only being underrepresented in the
   lowest quintile and slightly overrepresented in the top quintile and
   the top five percent.^[42]

   In terms of race in 2010 data, Asian American households had the
   highest median household income of $57,518, European-American
   households ranked second with $48,977, Hispanic or Latino households
   ranked third with $34,241. African-American or Black households had the
   lowest median household income of all races with $30,134.^[43]

Education and gender[edit]

   This graph shows the median annual household income in accordance with
   the householder's educational attainment. The data only applies to
   household with a householder over the age of twenty-five.^[44]

   Household income as well as per capita income in the United States rise
   significantly as the educational attainment increases.^[45] In 2005
   graduates with a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) who accepted
   job offers were expected to earn a base salary of $88,626. They were
   also expected to receive an "average signing bonus of $17,428."^[46]

   According to the US Census Bureau persons with doctorates in the United
   States had an average income of roughly $81,400. The average for an
   advanced degree was $72,824 with men averaging $90,761 and women
   averaging $50,756 annually. Year-round full-time workers with a
   professional degree had an average income of $109,600 while those with
   a Master's degree had an average income of $62,300. Overall,
   "…[a]verage earnings ranged from $18,900 for high school dropouts to
   $25,900 for high school graduates, $45,400 for college graduates and
   $99,300 for workers with professional degrees (M.D., D.P.T., D.P.M.,
   D.O., J.D., Pharm.D., D.D.S., or D.V.M.).^[47]

   Considering how education significantly enhances the earnings potential
   of individuals, it should come as no surprise that individuals with
   graduate degrees have an average per capita income exceeding the median
   household income of married couple families among the general
   population ($63,813 annually).^[47]^[48] Higher educational attainment
   did not, however, help close the income gap between the genders as the
   life-time earnings for a male with a professional degree were roughly
   forty percent (39.59%) higher than those of a female with a
   professional degree. The lifetime earnings gap between males and
   females was the smallest for those individuals holding an Associate
   degrees with male life-time earnings being 27.77% higher than those of
   females. While educational attainment did not help reduce the income
   inequality between men and women, it did increase the earnings
   potential of individuals of both sexes, enabling many households with
   one or more graduate degree householders to enter the top household
   income quintile.^[47]

   Household income also increased significantly with the educational
   attainment of the householder. The US Census Bureau publishes
   educational attainment and income data for all households with a
   householder who was aged twenty-five or older. The biggest income
   difference was between those with some college education and those who
   had a Bachelor's degree, with the latter making $23,874 more annually.
   Income also increased substantially with increased post-secondary
   education. While the median annual household income for a household
   with a householder having an Associates degree was $51,970, the median
   annual household income for householders with a Bachelor's degree or
   higher was $73,446. Those with doctorates had the second highest median
   household with a median of $96,830; $18,289 more than that for those at
   the Master's degree level, but $3,170 lower than the median for
   households with a professional degree holding householder.^[44]

Age of householder[edit]

   Household income in the United States varies substantially with the age
   of the person who heads the household. Overall, the median household
   income increased with the age of householder until retirement age when
   household income started to decline.^[50] The highest median household
   income was found among households headed by working baby-boomers.^[50]

   Households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median
   household income of $61,111 and a mean household income of $77,634. The
   median income per member of household for this particular group was
   $27,924. The highest median income per member of household was among
   those between the ages of 54 and 64 with $30,544 [The reason this
   figure is lower than the next group is because Pensions and Social
   Security add to income while a portion of older individuals also have
   work-related income.]).^[50]

   The group with the second highest median household income, were
   households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median
   income of $56,785, followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64
   with $50,400. Not surprisingly the lowest income group was composed of
   those households headed by individuals younger than 24, followed by
   those headed by persons over the age of 75. Overall, households headed
   by persons above the age of seventy-five had a median household income
   of $20,467 with the median household income per member of household
   being $18,645. These figures support the general assumption that median
   household income as well as the median income per member of household
   peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons, increasing
   with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the
   householder reaches the age of 64. With retirement income replacing
   salaries and the size of the household declining, the median household
   income decreases as well.^[50]

Household Size[edit]

   While median household income has a tendency to increase up to four
   persons per household, it declines for households beyond four persons.
   According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey, two-person
   households had a median income of $39,755, with $48,957 for
   three-person households, $54,338 for four-person households, $50,905
   for five-person households, $45,435 for six-person households, with
   seven-or-more-person households having the second lowest median income
   of only $42,471.^[51]

Geography[edit]

   Considering other racial and geographical differences in regards to
   household income, it should come as no surprise that the median
   household income varies with race, size of household and geography. The
   state with the highest median household income in the United States as
   of the US Census Bureau 2009 is Maryland with $69,272, followed by New
   Jersey, Connecticut and Alaska, making the Northeastern United States
   the wealthiest area by income in the entire country.^[52]

   Regionally, in 2010, the Northeast reached a median income of $53,283,
   the West, $53,142, the South, $45,492, and the Midwest, $48,445.^[53]
   Each figure represents a decline from the previous year.

Income by state[edit]

   In 2010, the median household income by state ranged from $35,693 in
   Mississippi to $66,334 in Maryland. California, with the highest median
   home price in the nation^[54] and home prices that far outpaced
   incomes,^[55] only ranked ninth with a median household income of
   $61,021.^[56] While California's median income was not near enough to
   afford the average California home or even a starter home, West
   Virginia, which had one of the nation's lowest median household
   incomes, also had the nation's lowest median home price.^[54]^[56]

   By Census Bureau Region, of the 15 states with the highest median
   household income, only Minnesota is located in the Mid-West, while five
   are in the Northeast (New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
   Hampshire and New York) three are in the South (Delaware, Maryland and
   Virginia), and the other six (Alaska, Hawaii, California, Washington,
   Colorado and Utah) are in the West.

   The southern states had, on average, the lowest median household
   income, with nine of the country's fifteen poorest states located in
   the South. However, most of the poverty in the South is located in
   rural areas. Metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte,
   Raleigh, Richmond, Birmingham, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are areas
   within the southern states that have above average income levels.
   Overall, median household income tended to be the highest in the
   nation's most urbanized northeastern, upper midwestern and west coast
   states, while rural areas, mostly in the southern and mountain states
   (like New Mexico, Montana and Idaho), had the lowest median household
   income.^[56]

Social class[edit]

   Main article: Social class in the United States

   Household income is one of the most commonly used measures of income
   and, therefore, also one of the most prominent indicators of social
   class. Household income and education do not, however, always reflect
   perceived class status correctly. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert
   acknowledges that "... the class structure... does not exactly match
   the distribution of household income" with "the mismatch [being]
   greatest in the middle..." (Gilbert, 1998: 92) As social classes
   commonly overlap, it is not possible to define exact class boundaries.

   According to Leonard Beeghley^[citation needed] a household income of
   roughly $95,000 would be typical of a dual-earner middle class
   household while $60,000 would be typical of a dual-earner working class
   household and $18,000 typical for an impoverished household. William
   Thompson and Joseph Hickey^[citation needed] see common incomes for the
   upper class as those exceeding $500,000 with upper middle class incomes
   ranging from the high 5-figures to most commonly in excess of $100,000.
   They claim the lower middle class ranges from $35,000 to $75,000;
   $16,000 to $30,000 for the working class and less than $2,000 for the
   lower class.
