   The United States of America is the world's largest national
   economy.^[22] The United States' nominal GDP was estimated to be
   $17.311 trillion as of Q2 2014,^[23] approximately a quarter of nominal
   global GDP.^[24]^[25] Its GDP at purchasing power parity is the 2nd
   largest of any single country in the world, approximately a 18% of the
   global total.^[26]^[27] The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in
   international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve
   currency.^[28] Several countries use it as their official currency, and
   in many others it is the de facto currency.^[29] The United States has
   a mixed economy^[30]^[31] and has maintained a stable overall GDP
   growth rate, a moderate unemployment rate, and high levels of research
   and capital investment.^[32] Its six largest trading partners are
   Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, Germany, and Italy.^[33]

   The US has abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure,
   and high productivity.^[34] It had the world's ninth-highest per capita
   GDP (nominal) and sixth-highest per capita GDP (PPP) as of
   2013.^[35]^[36] The U.S. is the world's third-largest producer of oil
   and largest producer of natural gas.^[37] It is the second-largest
   trading nation in the world behind China.^[38] It has been the world's
   largest national economy (not including colonial empires) since at
   least the 1890s.^[39] As of 2010, the country remains the world's
   largest manufacturer, representing a fifth of the global manufacturing
   output.^[40] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 132 are
   headquartered in the US, twice that of any other country.^[41]

   The United States has one of the world's largest and most influential
   financial markets. The New York Stock Exchange is by far the world's
   largest stock exchange by market capitalization.^[42] Foreign
   investments made in the US total almost $2.4 trillion,^[43] while
   American investments in foreign countries total over
   $3.3 trillion.^[44] Consumer spending comprises 71% of the US economy
   in 2013.^[45] The United States has the largest consumer market in the
   world, with a household final consumption expenditure five times larger
   than the Japan's.^[46] The labor market has attracted immigrants from
   all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in
   the world.^[47] The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in
   studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global
   Competitiveness Report, and others.^[48]

   The US economy is currently embroiled in the economic downturn which
   followed the financial crisis of 2007–08, with output still below
   potential according to the Congressional Budget Office^[49] and
   unemployment still above historic trends while household incomes have
   stagnated.^[50] As of August 2014, the unemployment rate was 6.1%,^[51]
   while the government's broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes
   the part-time underemployed, was 12.0%.^[52] At 11.3%, the U.S. has one
   of the lowest labor union participation rates in the OECD.^[53]
   Households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits,
   doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including
   2.8 million children.^[54] The wealthiest 10% of the population possess
   80% of all financial assets.^[55] Total public and private debt was
   $50.2 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2010, or 3.5 times
   GDP.^[56] In December 2013, the total of the public debt was about 0.7
   times GDP.^[57] Domestic financial assets totaled $131 trillion and
   domestic financial liabilities totaled $106 trillion.^[58]

   US real GDP contracted by 2.1% in the first quarter of 2014, the first
   decline since 2011.^[2] However in the second quarter of 2014, the US
   GDP grew by 4.2%, reversing the contraction seen in the first quarter
   and surpassing previous estimates.^[2]

History[edit]

   Main article: Economic history of the United States

Colonial era[edit]

   The economic history of the United States has its roots in European
   settlements in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The American
   colonies went from marginally successful colonial economies to a small,
   independent farming economy, which in 1776 became the United States of
   America. In 180 years, the US grew to a huge, integrated,
   industrialized economy that made up around one fifth of the world
   economy. As a result, the US GDP per capita converged on and eventually
   surpassed that of the U.K., as well as other nations that it previously
   trailed economically. The economy maintained high wages, attracting
   immigrants by the millions from all over the world.^[59]

1800s[edit]

   In the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with financial
   crises. The Panic of 1837 was followed by a five-year depression, with
   the failure of banks and then-record-high unemployment levels.^[60]
   Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, it is
   difficult to compare the severity of modern recessions to early
   recessions.^[61] Recessions after World War II appear to have been less
   severe than earlier recessions, but the reasons for this are
   unclear.^[62]

1900s[edit]

   The United States has been the world's largest national economy since
   at least the 1920s.^[39] For many years following the Great Depression
   of the 1930s, when danger of recession appeared most serious, the
   government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or
   cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering
   rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending.
   Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed
   substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the New Deal era
   that began in 1933, to the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s,
   national policy makers relied principally on fiscal policy to influence
   the economy.^[citation needed]

   The approach, advanced by British economist John Maynard Keynes, gave
   elected officials a leading role in directing the economy, since
   spending and taxes are controlled by the U.S. President and the
   Congress. The "Baby Boom" saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the
   period 1942–1957; it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing
   during depression years, a surge in prosperity, a demand for suburban
   single-family homes (as opposed to inner city apartments) and new
   optimism about the future. The boom crested about 1957, then slowly
   declined.^[63] A period of high inflation, interest rates and
   unemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool
   for regulating the overall pace of economic activity.^[64]

   The U.S. economy grew by an average of 3.8% from 1946 to 1973, while
   real median household income surged 74% (or 2.1% a year).^[65]^[66] The
   economy since 1973, however, has been characterized by both slower
   growth (averaging 2.7%), and nearly stagnant living standards, with
   household incomes increasing by 10%, or only 0.3% annually.^[67]

   The worst recession in recent decades, in terms of lost output,
   occurred during the financial crisis of 2007–08, when GDP fell by 5.0%
   from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009. Other significant
   recessions took place in 1957–58, when GDP fell 3.7%, following the
   1973 oil crisis, with a 3.1% fall from late 1973 to early 1975, and in
   the 1981–82 recession, when GDP dropped by 2.9%.^[68]^[69] Recent, mild
   recessions have included the 1990–91 downturn, when output fell by
   1.3%, and the 2001 recession, in which GDP slid by 0.3%; the 2001
   downturn lasted just eight months.^[69] The most vigorous, sustained
   periods of growth, on the other hand, took place from early 1961 to
   mid-1969, with an expansion of 53% (5.1% a year), from mid-1991 to late
   in 2000, at 43% (3.8% a year), and from late 1982 to mid-1990, at 37%
   (4% a year).^[68]

   In the 1970s and 1980s, it was popular in the U.S. to believe that
   Japan's economy would surpass that of the U.S., but this did not
   happen.^[70]

   Since the 1970s, several emerging countries have begun to close the
   economic gap with the United States. In most cases, this has been due
   to moving the manufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to
   countries where they could be made for sufficiently less money to cover
   the cost of shipping plus a higher profit.

   In other cases, some countries have gradually learned to produce the
   same products and services that previously only the U.S. and a few
   other countries could produce. Real income growth in the U.S. has
   slowed.

   The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, created one of the
   largest trade blocs in the world in 1994.

   Since 1976, the U.S. has sustained merchandise trade deficits with
   other nations, and since 1982, current account deficits. The nation's
   long-standing surplus in its trade in services was maintained, however,
   and reached a record US$231 billion in 2013.^[11] In recent years, the
   primary economic concerns have centered on: high household debt
   ($11 trillion, including $2.5 trillion in revolving debt),^[71] high
   net national debt ($9 trillion), high corporate debt ($9 trillion),
   high mortgage debt (over $15 trillion as of 2005 year-end), high
   external debt (amount owed to foreign lenders), high trade deficits, a
   serious deterioration in the United States net international investment
   position (NIIP) (−24% of GDP),^[72] and high unemployment.^[73] In
   2006, the U.S. economy had its lowest saving rate since 1933.^[74]
   These issues have raised concerns among economists and national
   politicians.^[75]

2000s[edit]

   U.S. public net debt and the total public debt

   The United States economy experienced a crisis in 2008 led by a
   derivatives market and subprime mortgage crisis, and a declining dollar
   value.^[76] On December 1, 2008, the NBER declared that the United
   States entered a recession in December 2007, citing employment and
   production figures as well as the third quarter decline in GDP.^[77]
   The recession did, however, lead to a reduction in record trade
   deficits, which fell from $840 billion annually during the 2006–08
   period, to $500 billion in 2009,^[68]^[78] as well as to higher
   personal savings rates, which jumped from a historic low of 1% in early
   2008, to nearly 5% in late 2009. The merchandise trade deficit rose to
   $670 billion in 2010; savings rates, however, remained at around
   5%.^[79]

   The U.S. public debt was $909 billion in 1980, an amount equal to 33%
   of America's gross domestic product (GDP; by 1990, that number had more
   than tripled to $3.2 trillion – or 56% of GDP.^[80] In 2001 the
   national debt was $5.7 trillion; however, the debt-to-GDP ratio
   remained at 1990 levels.^[81] Debt levels rose quickly in the following
   decade, and on January 28, 2010, the US debt ceiling was raised to
   $14.3 trillion.^[82] Based on the 2010 United States federal budget,
   total national debt will grow to nearly 100% of GDP, versus a level of
   approximately 80% in early 2009.^[83] The White House estimates that
   the government’s tab for servicing the debt will exceed $700 billion a
   year in 2019,^[84] up from $202 billion in 2009.^[85]

   The U.S. Treasury statistics indicate that, at the end of 2006, non-US
   citizens and institutions held 44% of federal debt held by the
   public.^[86] As of 2014^[update], China, holding $1.26 trillion in
   treasury bonds, is the largest foreign financier of the U.S. public
   debt.^[87]

   The distribution of household incomes in the United States has become
   more unequal during the post-2008 economic recovery, a first for the US
   but in line with the trend over the last ten economic recoveries since
   1949.^[88]^[89] Income inequality in the United States has grown from
   2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas.^[90] Median
   household wealth fell 35% in the US, from $106,591 to $68,839 between
   2005 and 2011.^[91]

Overview[edit]

   The growth in total US GDP vs median US household income, 1989–2011.

   The United States is the world's largest national economy. Some of the
   key contributors to this status are abundant natural resources, a
   well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.^[34] The U.S. is
   the world's third-largest producer of oil and largest producer of
   natural gas.^[37] It is the second-largest trading nation in the world
   behind China.^[92] It has been the world's largest national economy
   (not including colonial empires) since at least the 1890s.^[39] As of
   2010, the country remains the world's largest manufacturer,
   representing a fifth of the global manufacturing output.^[40] Of the
   world's 500 largest companies, 132 are headquartered in the US, twice
   that of any other country.^[41]

   The United States has one of the world's largest and most influential
   financial markets. The New York Stock Exchange is by far the world's
   largest stock exchange by market capitalization.^[42] Foreign
   investments made in the US total almost $2.4 trillion,^[43] while
   American investments in foreign countries total over
   $3.3 trillion.^[44] Consumer spending comprises 71% of the US economy
   in 2013.^[45] The United States has the largest consumer market in the
   world, with a household final consumption expenditure five times larger
   than the Japan's.^[46] The labor market has attracted immigrants from
   all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in
   the world.^[47] The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in
   studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global
   Competitiveness Report, and others.^[48]

   The US economy is currently embroiled in the economic downturn which
   followed the financial crisis of 2007–08, with output still below
   potential according to the Congressional Budget Office^[93] and
   unemployment still above historic trends while household incomes have
   stagnated.^[94] As of August 2014, the unemployment rate was 6.1%,^[95]
   while the government's broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes
   the part-time underemployed, was 12.2%.^[52] At 11.3%, the U.S. has one
   of the lowest labor union participation rates in the OECD.^[96]
   Households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits,
   doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including
   2.8 million children.^[54] The wealthiest 10% of the population possess
   80% of all financial assets.^[55] According to PolitiFact and others,
   in 2011 the top 400 wealthiest Americans "have more wealth than half of
   all Americans combined."^[97]^[98]^[99]^[100]

   Total public and private debt was $50.2 trillion at the end of the
   first quarter of 2010, or 3.5 times GDP.^[56] In December 2013, the
   total of the public debt was about 0.7 times GDP.^[101] Domestic
   financial assets totaled $131 trillion and domestic financial
   liabilities totaled $106 trillion.^[58] In 2013, the Legatum Institute
   announced that the US is facing economic decline, ranking 11th on the
   Prosperity Index.^[102] In a December 2013 paper by Sean Starrs of
   Toronto’s York University, it is argued that the U.S. economy didn't
   decline, but globalized. American firms still own 46% of the world’s
   top 500 corporations.^[103]^[104]^[105]

Business culture[edit]

   A central feature of the U.S. economy is the economic freedom afforded
   to the private sector by allowing the private sector to make the
   majority of economic decisions in determining the direction and scale
   of what the U.S. economy produces. This is enhanced by relatively low
   levels of regulation and government involvement,^[106] as well as a
   court system that generally protects property rights and enforces
   contracts. Today, the United States is home to 29.6 million small
   businesses, 30% of the world's millionaires, 40% of the world's
   billionaires, as well as 139 of the world's 500 largest
   companies.^[41]^[107]^[108]^[109]

   From its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has
   encouraged science and innovation. As a result, the United States has
   been the birthplace of 161 of Britannica's 321 Great Inventions,
   including items such as the airplane, internet, microchip, laser,
   cellphone, refrigerator, email, microwave, personal computer, LCD and
   LED technology, air conditioning, assembly line, supermarket, bar code,
   electric motor, ATM, and many more.^[110]

   The United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil,
   and it is fortunate to have a moderate climate. It also has extensive
   coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as on the
   Gulf of Mexico. Rivers flow from far within the continent and the Great
   Lakes—five large, inland lakes along the U.S. border with
   Canada—provide additional shipping access. These extensive waterways
   have helped shape the country's economic growth over the years and
   helped bind America's 50 individual states together in a single
   economic unit.^[111]

   The number of workers and, more importantly, their productivity help
   determine the health of the U.S. economy. Consumer spending in the US
   rose to about 62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and
   has since risen to 71% in 2013.^[45] Throughout its history, the United
   States has experienced steady growth in the labor force, a phenomenon
   that is both cause and effect of almost constant economic expansion.
   Until shortly after World War I, most workers were immigrants from
   Europe, their immediate descendants, or African Americans who were
   mostly slaves taken from Africa, or their descendants.^[112]

Demographic shift[edit]

   See also: Demographics of the United States

   Beginning in the late 20th century, many Latin Americans immigrated,
   followed by large numbers of Asians after the removal of nation-origin
   based immigration quotas.^[113] The promise of high wages brings many
   highly skilled workers from around the world to the United States, as
   well as millions of illegal immigrants seeking work in the informal
   economy. Over 13 million people officially entered the United States
   during the 1990s alone.^[114]

   Labor mobility has also been important to the capacity of the American
   economy to adapt to changing conditions. When immigrants flooded labor
   markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland
   waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial,
   northern cities attracted black Americans from southern farms in the
   first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the Great
   Migration.

   In the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of
   owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed
   by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of
   mass production, corporations, such as General Electric, have been
   instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the stock market,
   American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and
   withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of
   globalization, American investors and corporations have influence all
   over the world. The American government is also included among the
   major investors in the American economy. Government investments have
   been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the Hoover
   Dam), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.

Unemployment[edit]

   Main articles: Unemployment in the United States and List of U.S.
   states by unemployment rate

   As of February 2013, the unemployment rate in the United States was
   7.7%^[130] or 12.0 million people,^[131] while the government's broader
   U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the part-time underemployed was
   14.3%^[132] or 22.2 million people. These figures were calculated with
   a civilian labor force of approximately 155 million people,^[133]
   relative to a U.S. population of approximately 315 million
   people.^[134]

   In 2009 through 2013, following the Great Recession, the emerging
   problem of jobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long-term
   unemployment with over 6 million workers looking for work longer than 6
   months as of January 2010. This particularly affected older
   workers.^[73] In the year following the recession's end in June 2009 in
   the United States, immigrants gained 656,000 jobs, while U.S.-born
   workers lost more than a million jobs.^[135]

   In April 2010, the official unemployment rate was 9.9%, but the
   government’s broader U-6 unemployment rate was 17.1%.^[136] In the
   period between February 2008 and February 2010, the number of people
   working part-time for economic reasons has increased by 4 million to
   8.8 million, an 83% increase in part-time workers during the two-year
   period.^[137] By 2013, although the unemployment rate had fallen below
   8%, the record proportion of long term unemployed and continued
   decreasing household income remained indicative of a jobless
   recovery.^[138]

   After being higher in the postwar period, the U.S. unemployment rate
   fell below the rising eurozone unemployment rate in the mid-1980s and
   has remained significantly lower almost continuously
   since.^[139]^[140]^[141] In 1955, 55% of Americans worked in services,
   between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15% in
   agriculture. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25%
   and 30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture.^[142] Male
   unemployment continued to be significantly higher than female
   unemployment (9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009). The unemployment among Caucasians
   continues to be much lower than African-American unemployment (at 8.5%
   vs. 15.8% in 2009).^[143]

   The youth unemployment rate was 18.5% in July 2009, the highest July
   rate since 1948.^[144] The unemployment rate of young African Americans
   was 28.2% in May 2013.^[145] Officially, Detroit’s unemployment rate is
   27%, but Detroit News suggests that nearly half of this city’s
   working-age population may be unemployed.^[146]

Research, development, and entrepreneurship[edit]

   Tennessee in 1897. The US was a leader in the adoption of electric
   lighting

   The United States has been a leader in scientific research and
   technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876,
   Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the
   telephone. Thomas Edison's laboratory developed the phonograph, the
   first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.
   Nikola Tesla pioneered the AC induction motor and high frequency power
   transmission used in radio. In the early 20th century, the automobile
   companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly
   line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and
   controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.^[149]
   Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the best-known American
   entrepreneurs.

   American society highly emphasizes entrepreneurship and business.
   Entrepreneurship is the act of being an entrepreneur, which can be
   defined as "one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen
   in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods". This may
   result in new organizations or may be part of revitalizing mature
   organizations in response to a perceived opportunity.^[150]

   The most obvious form of entrepreneurship refers to the process and
   engagement of starting new businesses (referred as Startup Company);
   however, in recent years, the term has been extended to include social
   and political forms of entrepreneurial activity. When entrepreneurship
   is describing activities within a firm or large organization it is
   referred to as intra-preneurship and may include corporate venturing,
   when large entities spin-off organizations.^[150]

   According to Paul Reynolds, entrepreneurship scholar and creator of the
   Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, "by the time they reach their
   retirement years, half of all working men in the United States probably
   have a period of self-employment of one or more years; one in four may
   have engaged in self-employment for six or more years. Participating in
   a new business creation is a common activity among U.S. workers over
   the course of their careers."^[151] And in recent years, business
   creation has been documented by scholars such as David Audretsch to be
   a major driver of economic growth in both the United States and Western
   Europe.

   Venture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States and it
   is still dominated by the U.S.^[152] According to the National Venture
   Capital Association 11% of private sector jobs come from venture
   capital backed companies and venture capital backed revenue accounts
   for 21% of US GDP.^[153]

   Some new American businesses raise investments from angel investors
   (venture capitalists). In 2010 healthcare/medical accounted for the
   largest share of angel investments, with 30% of total angel investments
   (vs. 17% in 2009), followed by software (16% vs. 19% in 2007), biotech
   (15% vs. 8% in 2009), industrial/energy (8% vs. 17% in 2009), retail
   (5% vs. 8% in 2009) and IT services (5%).^[154] ^[clarification needed]

   Americans are “venturesome consumers” who are unusually willing to try
   new products of all sorts, and to pester manufacturers to improve their
   products.^[155]

   As of Q4 2013, total household net worth in the United States is
   $80.664 trillion, an increase of $9.8 trillion from 2012. Employee
   compensation amounts to $8.969 trillion, while gross private investment
   totals $2.781 trillion.^[156] The mean net worth of US adults increased
   to $301,140 in 2013, with the majority being held in financial assets,
   due to higher activity by shareholders and more private
   investment.^[157] Including human capital such as skills, the United
   Nations estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be
   $118 trillion.^[158]

   While inflation-adjusted household income had been increasing almost
   every year from 1945 to 2007, it has since been flat and even decreased
   recently.^[159] U.S. median household income fell from $51,144 in 2010
   to $50,502 in 2011.^[160] Middle class incomes in the United States
   fell into a tie with those in Canada in 2010, and may have fallen
   behind by 2014, while several other advanced economies have closed the
   gap in recent years.^[161]

   The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 95 percent of the
   income gains from 2009 to 2012,^[162] while their share of total income
   has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in
   2011.^[163] According to a 2014 OECD report, 80% of total income growth
   went to the top 10% from 1975 to 2007.^[164] The top 10% wealthiest
   possess 80% of all financial assets.^[55] Wealth inequality in the U.S.
   is greater than in most developed countries other than Switzerland and
   Denmark.^[165] Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who
   have become rich may have had a "substantial head start".^[166]^[167]
   In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, "over
   60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans "grew up in substantial
   privilege".^[168]

   A number of economists and others have expressed growing concern about
   income inequality, calling it "deeply worrying",^[169] unjust,^[170] a
   danger to democracy/social stability,^[171]^[172]^[173] or a sign of
   national decline.^[174] Yale professor Robert Shiller has said, "The
   most important problem that we are facing now today, I think, is rising
   inequality in the United States and elsewhere in the world."^[175]
   Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics argues that the
   post-1980 increase in inequality played a role in the 2008 crisis by
   contributing to the nation's financial instability.^[176]

   Others disagree, saying there is a lack of evidence that the success of
   some harms others, and that the inequality issue is a political
   distraction from what they consider real problems like chronic
   unemployment and sluggish growth.^[177]^[178] George Mason University
   economics professor Tyler Cowen has called inequality a "red
   herring",^[179] saying that factors driving its increase within a
   nation can simultaneously be driving its reduction globally, and
   arguing that redistributive policies intended to reduce inequality can
   do more harm than good regarding the real problem of stagnant
   wages.^[180] Robert Lucas, Jr. has argued that the salient problem
   American living standards face is a government that has grown too much,
   and that recent policy shifts in the direction of European style
   taxation, welfare spending, and regulation may be indefinitely putting
   the US on a significantly lower, European level income
   trajectory.^[181]^[182] Some researchers have disputed the accuracy of
   the underlying data regarding claims about inequality
   trends,^[183]^[184] and economists Michael Bordo and Christopher M.
   Meissner have argued that inequality cannot be blamed for the 2008
   financial crisis.^[185]

   About 30% of the entire world's millionaire population resides in the
   United States (as of 2009^[update]).^[186] The Economist Intelligence
   Unit estimated in 2008 that there were 16,600,000 millionaires in the
   U.S.^[187] Furthermore, 34% of the world's billionaires are American
   (in 2011).^[107]^[188]
   Productivity and Real Median Family Income Growth 1947-2009. There has
   been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the
   1970s.^[189] The primary cause for the gap between productivity and
   income growth is the decline in per capita hours worked.^[190] Other
   causes include the rise in non-cash benefits as a share of worker
   compensation (which aren't counted in CPS income data), immigrants
   entering the labor force, statistical distortions including the use of
   different inflation adjusters by the BLS and CPS, productivity gains
   being skewed toward less labor-intensive sectors, income shifting from
   labor to capital, a skill gap-driven wage disparity, productivity being
   falsely inflated by hidden technology-driven depreciation increases and
   import price measurement problems, and/or a natural period of
   adjustment following an income surge during aberrational postwar
   circumstances.^[177]^[191]^[192]^[193]

   According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, decreased
   progressiveness in capital gains taxes was the largest contributor to
   the increase in overall income inequality in the US from 1996 to
   2006.^[194] According to the Federal Reserve Board, in 2010 single
   Black and Hispanic women ages 18–64 had a median wealth of $100 and
   $120 respectively, excluding vehicles, while the median for single
   white women was $41,500.^[195]

   As of 2010 The U.S. had the fourth widest income distribution among
   OECD nations, behind Turkey, Mexico and Chile.^[196]^[197]^[198] The
   Brookings Institution said in March 2013 that income inequality was
   increasing and becoming permanent, sharply reducing social mobility in
   the US.^[199] The OECD ranks the US 10th in social mobility, behind the
   Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and France.^[200]
   This has been partly attributed to the depth of American poverty, which
   leaves poor children economically disadvantaged,^[201] though others
   have observed that a relative rise in the U.S. is mathematically harder
   due to its higher and more widely distributed income range than in
   nations with artificial income compression, even if one enjoys more
   absolute mobility in the U.S., and have questioned how meaningful such
   international comparisons are.^[202]

Home ownership[edit]

   Further information: Homeownership in the United States

   The average home in the United States has more than 700 square feet per
   person, which is 50%–100% more than the average in other high-income
   countries. Similarly, ownership rates of gadgets and amenities are
   relatively high compared to other countries.^[203]^[204]^[205]

   Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling
   asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a
   quarter of their value.^[206] Since peaking in the second quarter of
   2007, household wealth is down $14 trillion.^[207] The Fed also said
   that at the end of 2008, the debt owed by nonfinancial sectors was
   $33.5 trillion, including household debt valued at
   $13.8 trillion.^[208]

Profits and wages[edit]

   Real compensation per hour in the USA (1947-2013).

   In March 2013, as the stock market's Dow Jones Industrial Average set
   record highs, household and personal income were both down sharply from
   their 2007 peaks. In 1970, wages represented more than 51% of the U.S.
   GDP and profits were less than 5%. But by 2013, wages had fallen to 44%
   of the economy, while profits had more than doubled to 11%.^[209]
   Inflation-adjusted ("real") per-capita disposable personal income rose
   steadily in the U.S. from 1945 to 2008, but has since remained
   generally level.^[210]^[211]

   In 2005, median personal income for those over the age of 18 ranged
   from $3,317 for an unemployed, married Asian American female^[212] to
   $55,935 for a full-time, year-round employed Asian American male.^[213]
   According to the US Census men tended to have higher income than women
   while Asians and Whites earned more than African Americans and
   Hispanics. The overall median personal income for all individuals over
   the age of 18 was $24,062^[214] ($32,140 for those age 25 or above) in
   the year 2005.^[215]

   The overall median income for all 155 million persons over the age of
   15 who worked with earnings in 2005 was $28,567.^[216] As a reference
   point, the minimum wage rate in 2009 was $7.25 per hour or $15,080 for
   the 2080 hours in a typical work year. The minimum wage is a little
   more than the poverty level for a single person unit and about 50% of
   the poverty level for a family of four.

Poverty[edit]

   Main article: Poverty in the United States

   The gap in income between rich and poor is greater in the United States
   than in any other developed country.^[217] Starting in the 1980s
   relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other
   wealthy nations, though analyses using a common data set for
   comparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty
   rate by market income than most other wealthy nations.^[198] Extreme
   poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2
   per day before government benefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5
   million households in 2011, including 2.8 million children.^[54] In
   2013, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million
   children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007
   levels.^[218]

   Half of the U.S. population lives in poverty or is low-income,
   according to U.S. census data.^[219] According to a survey by the
   Associated Press, four out of five U.S. adults struggle with
   joblessness, near-poverty or reliance on welfare for at least parts of
   their lives.^[220] Feeding America reported in 2014 that 49 million
   Americans are "food insecure."^[221]

   The population in extreme-poverty neighborhoods rose by one-third from
   2000 to 2009.^[222] People living in such neighborhoods tend to suffer
   from inadequate access to quality education; higher crime rates; higher
   rates of physical and psychological ailment; limited access to credit
   and wealth accumulation; higher prices for goods and services; and
   constrained access to job opportunities.^[222] As of 2013, 44% of
   America's poor are considered to be in "deep poverty," with an income
   50% or more below the government's official poverty line.^[223]

   There were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in
   the U.S. in January 2009. Almost two-thirds stayed in an emergency
   shelter or transitional housing program and the other third were living
   on the street, in an abandoned building, or another place not meant for
   human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S.
   population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program
   between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.^[224] Around 44% of
   homeless people are employed.^[225]

   The United States has one of the least extensive social safety nets in
   the developed world, reducing both relative poverty and absolute
   poverty by considerably less than the mean for wealthy
   nations.^[226]^[227]^[228]^[229] The living standards for the poor in
   the United States are also among the highest in the world.^[198]^[not

Financial position[edit]

   Main article: Financial position of the United States
   Assets of the United States as a fraction of GDP 1960-2008
   Liabilities of the United States as a fraction of GDP 1960-2009

   The overall financial position of the United States as of 2014 includes
   $269.6 trillion of assets owned by households, businesses, and
   governments within its borders, representing more than 15.7 times the
   annual gross domestic product of the United States. Debts owed during
   this same period amounted to $145.8 trillion, about 8.5 times the
   annual gross domestic product.^[230]^[231]

   Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest
   rates on government debt.^[232] Such low rates, outpaced by the
   inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no
   alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional
   investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money
   market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest
   sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against
   risk.^[233]^[234] Lawrence Summers, Matthew Yglesias and other
   economists state that at such low rates, government debt borrowing
   saves taxpayer money, and improves creditworthiness.^[235]^[236]

   In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced
   their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking
   advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee
   that government debt rates will continue to stay so low.^[233]^[237] In
   January 2012, the U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the
   Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association unanimously
   recommended that government debt be allowed to auction even lower, at
   negative absolute interest rates.^[238]

   Now that the connection between public and private debt is
   better-known,^[239]^[240] U.S. combined debts are worrisome. See Causes
   of the Great Depression: Debt Deflation.

Composition of economic sectors[edit]

   Agriculture in the United States

   A wheat harvest in Idaho

   The United States is the world's 2nd largest manufacturer, with a 2013
   industrial output of US$2.4 trillion. Its manufacturing output is
   greater than of Germany, France, India, and Brazil combined.^[241] Its
   main industries include petroleum, steel, automobiles, construction
   machinery, aerospace, agricultural machinery, telecommunications,
   chemicals, electronics, food processing, consumer goods, lumber, and
   mining.

   The US leads the world in airplane manufacturing,^[242] which
   represents a large portion of US industrial output. American companies
   such as Boeing, Cessna (see: Textron), Lockheed Martin (see: Skunk
   Works), and General Dynamics produce a vast majority of the world's
   civilian and military aircraft in factories stretching across the
   United States.^[citation needed]

   The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has experienced
   substantial job losses over the past several years.^[243]^[244] In
   January 2004, the number of such jobs stood at 14.3 million, down by
   3.0 million jobs, or 17.5 percent, since July 2000 and about
   5.2 million since the historical peak in 1979. Employment in
   manufacturing was its lowest since July 1950.^[245] The number of steel
   workers fell from 500,000 in 1980 to 224,000 in 2000.^[246]

   The U.S. produces approximately 18% of the world's manufacturing
   output, a share that has declined as other nations developed
   competitive manufacturing industries.^[247] The job loss during this
   continual volume growth is the result of multiple factors including
   increased productivity, trade, and secular economic trends.^[248] In
   addition, growth in telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, aircraft,
   heavy machinery and other industries along with declines in low end,
   low skill industries such as clothing, toys, and other simple
   manufacturing have resulted in some U.S. jobs being more highly skilled
   and better paying. There has been much debate within the United States
   on whether the decline in manufacturing jobs are related to American
   unions, lower foreign wages, or both.^[249]^[250]^[251]

   Although agriculture comprises less than two percent of the economy,
   the United States is a net exporter of food. With vast tracts of
   temperate arable land, technologically advanced agribusiness, and
   agricultural subsidies, the United States controls almost half of world
   grain exports.^[252] Products include wheat, corn, other grains,
   fruits, vegetables, cotton; beef, pork, poultry, dairy products; forest
   products; fish.^[citation needed]

   The Port of Houston, one of the largest ports in the United States.

   The United States is the second largest energy consumer in total
   use.^[264] The U.S. ranks seventh in energy consumption per-capita
   after Canada and a number of other countries.^[265]^[266] The majority
   of this energy is derived from fossil fuels: in 2005, it was estimated
   that 40% of the nation's energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and
   23% from natural gas. Nuclear power supplied 8.4% and renewable energy
   supplied 6.8%, which was mainly from hydroelectric dams although other
   renewables are included.^[267]

   American dependence on oil imports grew from 24% in 1970 to 65% by the
   end of 2005.^[268] Transportation has the highest consumption rates,
   accounting for approximately 68.9% of the oil used in the United States
   in 2006,^[269] and 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch
   report.^[citation needed]

   In 2013, the United States imported 2,808 million barrels of crude oil,
   compared to 3,377 million barrels in 2010.^[270] While the U.S. is the
   largest importer of fuel, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that
   the country was about to become a net fuel exporter for the first time
   in 62 years. The paper reported expectations that this would continue
   until 2020.^[271] In fact, petroleum was the major export from the
   country in 2011.^[272]

   Measured by value of its listed companies' securities, the New York
   Stock Exchange is more than three times larger than any other stock
   exchange in the world.^[274] As of October 2008, the combined
   capitalization of all domestic NYSE listed companies was
   US$10.1 trillion.^[275] NASDAQ is another American stock exchange and
   the world's 3rd largest exchange after the New York Stock Exchange and
   Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange. However NASDAQ's trade value is larger
   than Japan's TSE.^[274] NASDAQ is the largest electronic screen-based
   equity securities trading market in the U.S. With approximately 3,800
   companies and corporations, it has more trading volume per hour than
   any other stock exchange.^[276]

   The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business
   profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period,
   finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%,
   and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from
   10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to
   all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income
   earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New
   York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in
   2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to
   $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than
   $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by
   2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in

Health care[edit]

   Main article: Health care in the United States
   Life expectancy compared to healthcare spending from 1970 to 2008, in
   the US and the next 19 most wealthy countries by total GDP.^[283]

   Many distinct organizations provide health care in the US. Facilities
   are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. Health
   insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the
   government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from
   programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the Children's Health
   Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the
   population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer,
   some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are
   uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health
   insurance.^[284] Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National
   Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States ranked at or near the
   top in obesity rate, frequency of automobile use and accidents,
   homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence of heart and lung disease,
   sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, recreational
   drug or alcohol deaths, injuries, and rates of disability. Together,
   such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at the bottom of
   that list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected
   to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country,
   though Americans who reach age 75 live longer than those who reach that
   age in peer nations.^[285]

   A comprehensive 2007 study by European doctors found the five-year
   cancer survival rate was significantly higher in the U.S. than in all
   21 European nations studied, 66.3% for men versus the European mean of
   47.3% and 62.9% versus 52.8% for women.^[286]^[287] Americans undergo
   cancer screenings at significantly higher rates than people in other
   developed countries, and access MRI and CT scans at the highest rate of
   any OECD nation.^[288] People in the U.S. diagnosed with high
   cholesterol or hypertension access pharmaceutical treatments at higher
   rates than those diagnosed in other developed nations, and are more
   likely to successfully control the conditions.^[289]^[290] Diabetics
   are more likely to receive treatment and meet treatment targets in the
   U.S. than in Canada, England, or Scotland.^[291]^[292]

   The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely
   developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most
   important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of
   physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.
   Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine than
   the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more
   money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than
   in Europe.^[293]^[294]

   According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States
   spent more on health care per capita ($7,146), and more on health care
   as percentage of its GDP (15.2%), than any other nation in 2008. In
   2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population reported not
   carrying health insurance to the U.S. Census. Of that number 18.3
   million had annual household incomes at or greater than $50,000, 9.5
   million had household incomes of $75,000 or higher, 16.2 million had
   household incomes of less than $25,000, 27.2 million were under age 35,
   and 9.7 million were non-citizens.^[295] The Census has stated that its
   surveys likely underreport insurance coverage. For example, a quality
   control analysis revealed that 16.9% of those enrolled in Medicaid
   incorrectly reported being uninsured.^[295]^[296] Analyses have also
   shown that millions of uninsured are eligible for coverage through
   programs like Medicaid but have not signed up or have let their
   enrollments expire.^[297] According to Physicians for a National Health
   Program, this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary
   deaths per year.^[298] The group's methodology has been criticized by
   John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or tracking insurance
   status changes over time, including the time of death.^[299] A 2009
   study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no
   increased mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors
   were controlled for.^[300]

   The high cost of health care in the United States is attributed
   variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing,
   suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more
   medical care than people in other countries, the high wages of doctors,
   government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment
   systems insulating consumers from the full cost of
   treatments.^[301]^[302]^[303] The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals,
   medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans.
   Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other
   countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the
   United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery
   after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than
   Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts
   are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private
   insurers and drug companies.^[302]^[304] Government plans often pay
   less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost
   to the privately insured through higher prices.^[305]^[306]

International trade[edit]

   Main article: Foreign trade of the United States

   Economic Complexity

   The United States is the world's second largest trading nation.^[307]
   There is a large amount of U.S. dollars in circulation all around the
   planet; about 60% of funds used in international trade are U.S.
   dollars. The dollar is also used as the standard unit of currency in
   international markets for commodities such as gold and
   petroleum.^[308]^[309]

   In 2013, U.S. exports goods and services amounted to $2.27 trillion and
   imports goods and services amounted to $2.74 trillion, with a trade
   deficit was $450.3 billion.^[11] The deficit on petroleum products was
   $232 billion. The trade deficit with China was $318 billion in
   2013,^[310] a new record and up from $304 million in 1983.^[311]
   U.S. Trade in Goods and Services 1960–2010.

   The United States had a $231 billion surplus on trade in services, and
   $703 billion deficit on trade in goods in 2013.^[11] China has expanded
   its foreign exchange reserves, which included $1.6 trillion of U.S.
   securities as of 2013^[update].^[312] In 2010, the ten largest trading
   partners of the U.S. were Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, Germany, the
   United Kingdom, South Korea, France, Taiwan, and Brazil.^[313]

   According to the KOF Index of Globalization and the Globalization Index
   by A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Magazine, the U.S. has a relatively high
   degree of globalization. U.S. workers send a third of all remittances
   in the world.^[314]

Currency and central bank[edit]

   Main articles: United States dollar and Federal Reserve System
   United States historical inflation rate, 1666–2004.

   The United States dollar is the unit of currency of the United States.
   The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international
   transactions.^[315] Several countries use it as their official
   currency, and in many others it is the de facto currency.^[316]

   The federal government attempts to use both monetary policy (control of
   the money supply through mechanisms such as changes in interest rates)
   and fiscal policy (taxes and spending) to maintain low inflation, high
   economic growth, and low unemployment. A private central bank, known as
   the Federal Reserve, was formed in 1913 to supposedly provide a stable
   currency and monetary policy. The U.S. dollar has been regarded as one
   of the more stable currencies in the world and many nations back their
   own currency with U.S. dollar reserves.^[28]^[29]

   The U.S. dollar has maintained its position as the world's primary
   reserve currency, although it is gradually being challenged in that
   role.^[317] Almost two-thirds of currency reserves held around the
   world are held in US dollars, compared to around 25% for the next most
   popular currency, the Euro.^[318] Rising US national debt and
   quantitative easing has caused some to predict that the US Dollar will
   lose its status as the world's reserve currency, however these
   predictions have not come to fruition.^[319]

   Deficit and debt increases 2001–2012.

   The United States ranked 4th in the Ease of Doing Business Index in
   2012, 18th in the Economic Freedom of the World index by the Fraser
   Institute in 2012, 10th in the Index of Economic Freedom by the Wall
   Street Journal and Heritage Foundation in 2012, 15th in the 2014 Global
   Enabling Trade Report,^[320] and 3rd on the Global Competitiveness
   Report.^[321]

   According to the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, released by the Wall
   Street Journal and Heritage Foundation, the US has dropped out of the
   top 10 most economically free countries. The US has been on a steady 7
   year economic freedom decline and is the only country to do so.^[322]
   The index measures each nation's commitment to free enterprise on a
   scale of 0 to 100. Countries losing economic freedom and receiving low
   index scores are at risk of economic stagnation, high unemployment
   rates, and diminishing social conditions.^[323]^[324] The 2014 Index of
   Economic Freedom gave the United States a score of 75.5 and is listed
   as the 12th freest economy in world. It dropped two rankings and its
   score is half a point lower than in 2013. The US is ranked the 2nd
   freest economy out of the three countries in the North America
   region.^[322]

Regulations[edit]

   The U.S. federal government regulates private enterprise in numerous
   ways. Regulation falls into two general categories.

   Some efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices.
   Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated
   monopolies such as electric utilities from while allowing prices in the
   level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government
   has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In
   the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system
   to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate
   wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of
   other industries—trucking and, later, airlines—successfully sought
   regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful
   price-cutting, a process called regulatory capture.^[325]

   Another form of economic regulation, antitrust law, seeks to strengthen
   market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The
   government—and, sometimes, private parties—have used antitrust law to
   prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit
   competition.^[325]

   Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to
   other G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator.
   In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level.
   The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments
   in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness
   related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud
   prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending,
   and promoting lending to lower-income segments.

   Since the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private
   companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's
   health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example,
   the Occupational Safety and Health Administration provides and enforces
   standards for workplace safety, and the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency provides standards and regulations to maintain air,
   water, and land resources. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
   regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards
   of disclosure for food products.^[325]

   American attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the
   final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy
   makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected
   companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines
   and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new
   competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once
   were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a
   succession of laws easing regulation.^[325]

   While leaders of America's two most influential political parties
   generally favored economic deregulation during the 1970s, 1980s, and
   1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to
   achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance
   in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in
   the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor,
   consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation
   interfered with free enterprise, increased the costs of doing business,
   and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is
   mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events
   or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some
   areas, including environmental protection.^[325]

   Where legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have
   turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly. For
   instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually the government
   itself, sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette
   smoking. The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement provided states
   with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related
   illnesses.^[325]

   Between 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the
   most rapid expansion since the early 1970s.^[326] The number of new
   pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose
   from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record
   amount of regulation.^[326] Economically significant regulations,
   defined as regulations which cost more than $100 million a year,
   increased by 70%.^[326] Spending on regulation increased by 62% from
   $26.4 billion to $42.7 billion.^[326]

Taxation[edit]

   projected for 2014 by the Tax Policy Center.^[327]^[328]
   CBO estimates of historical effective federal tax rates broken down by
   income level.^[329]

   Taxation in the United States is a complex system which may involve
   payment to at least four different levels of government and many
   methods of taxation. Taxes are levied by the federal government, by the
   state governments, and often by local governments, which may include
   counties, municipalities, township, school districts, and other
   special-purpose districts, which include fire, utility, and transit
   districts.^[330]

   Forms of taxation include taxes on income, property, sales, imports,
   payroll, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. When taxation by
   all government levels taken into consideration, the total taxation as
   percentage of GDP was approximately a quarter of GDP in 2011.^[331]
   Share of black market in the U.S. economy is very low compared to other
   countries.^[332]

   Although a federal wealth tax is prohibited by the United States
   Constitution unless the receipts are distributed to the States by their
   populations, state and local government property tax amount to a wealth
   tax on real estate, and because capital gains are taxed on nominal
   instead of inflation-adjusted profits, the capital gains tax amounts to
   a wealth tax on the inflation rate.^[333]

   U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially at the federal
   level, and is among the most progressive in the developed
   world.^[329]^[334]^[335]^[336] There is debate over whether taxes
   should be more or less progressive.^[333]^[337]^[338]^[339]

Expenditure[edit]

   debt

   2012.^[340]

   Fiscal Year 2012 U.S. Federal Receipts

   The United States public-sector spending amounts to about 30% of GDP.

   Each level of government provides many direct services. The federal
   government, for example, is responsible for national defense, research
   that often leads to the development of new products, conducts space
   exploration, and runs numerous programs designed to help workers
   develop workplace skills and find jobs (including higher education).
   Government spending has a significant effect on local and regional
   economies—and on the overall pace of economic activity.

   State governments, meanwhile, are responsible for the construction and
   maintenance of most highways. State, county, or city governments play
   the leading role in financing and operating public schools. Local
   governments are primarily responsible for police and fire protection.

   The welfare system in the United States began in the 1930s, during the
   Great Depression, with the passage of the New Deal. The welfare system
   was later expanded in the 1960s through Great Society legislation,
   which included Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act and federal
   education funding.

   Overall, federal, state, and local spending accounted for almost 28% of
   gross domestic product in 1998.^[341]

   As of January 20, 2009, the total U.S. federal debt was
   $10.627 trillion.^[342] The borrowing-cap debt ceiling as of 2005 stood
   at $8.18 trillion.^[343] In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an
   additional $0.79 trillion to $8.97 trillion, which is approximately 68%
   of GDP.^[344] Congress has used this method to deal with an encroaching
   debt ceiling in previous years, as the federal borrowing limit was
   raised in 2002 and 2003.^[345] As of October 4, 2008, the "Emergency
   Economic Stabilization Act of 2008" raised the current debt ceiling to
   US$11.3 trillion.^[346]

   The federal government's debt rose by $680 billion in 2013,^[15] and
   now stands at $17.091 trillion.^[347] While the U.S. public debt is the
   world's largest in absolute size, another measure is its size relative
   to the nation's GDP. As of October 2013 the debt was 107.0% of
   GDP.^[348] This debt, as a percent of GDP, is still less than the debt
   of Japan (192%) and roughly equivalent to those of a few western
   European nations.^[349]

Budget[edit]

   Further information: United States budget

   In Fiscal Year 2012, the U.S. federal government ran a budget deficit
   of $1.09 trillion.^[350] The U.S. federal public debt was $17.07
   trillion (107% of GDP) as of October 26, 2013.^[351]
