   Crime in the United States has been present since colonization. Crime
   rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after World War II,
   before peaking between the 1970s and early 1990s. Since the early
   1990s, crime has declined in the United States,^[1] and current crime
   rates are approximately the same as those of the 1960s.^[2]

   Statistics on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime
   Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual
   National Crime Victimization Surveys by the Bureau of Justice
   Statistics.^[3] In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known
   as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the
   status of law enforcement in the United States.^[2] The report's
   definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American
   law enforcement agencies.^[4] According to the FBI, index crime in the
   United States includes violent crime and property crime.^[5] Violent
   crime consists of four criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent
   manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; property
   crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and
   arson.^[5]

Crime over time[edit]

   beginning in 1960. Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics.

   In the long term, violent crime in the United States has been in
   decline since colonial times.^[6] However, during the early 20th
   century, crime rates in the United States were higher compared to parts
   of Western Europe. For example, 198 homicides were recorded in the
   American city of Chicago in 1916, a city of slightly over 2 million at
   the time. This level of crime was not exceptional when compared to
   other American cities such as New York, but was much higher relative to
   European cities, such as London, which then had three times the
   population but recorded only 45 homicides in the same year.^[7]

   After World War II, crime rates increased in the United States, peaking
   from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Violent crime nearly quadrupled
   between 1960 and its peak in 1991. Property crime more than doubled
   over the same period. Since the 1990s, however, crime in the United
   States has declined steeply. Several theories have been proposed to
   explain this decline:
    1. The number of police officers increased considerably in the
       1990s.^[8]
    2. On September 16, 1994, President Clinton signed the Violent Crime
       Control and Law Enforcement Act into law. Under the act, over $30
       billion in federal aid was spent over a six year period to improve
       state and local law enforcement, prisons and crime prevention
       programs.^[9] Proponents of the law, including the President,
       touted it as a lead contributor to the sharp drop in crime which
       occurred throughout the 1990s,^[9] while critics have dismissed it
       as an unprecedented federal boondoggle.^[9]
    3. The prison population has been expanded since the mid-1970s.^[8]
    4. Starting in the mid-1980s, the crack cocaine market grew rapidly
       before declining again a decade later. Some authors have pointed
       towards the link between violent crimes and crack use.^[8]
    5. One hypothesis suggests a causal link between legalized abortion
       and the drop in crime during the 1990s.^[10]
    6. Changing demographics of an aging population has been cited for the
       drop in overall crime.^[11]
    7. Another hypothesis suggests reduced lead exposure as the cause;
       Scholar Mark A.R. Kleiman writes: "Given the decrease in lead
       exposure among children since the 1980s and the estimated effects
       of lead on crime, reduced lead exposure could easily explain a very
       large proportion—certainly more than half—of the crime decrease of
       the 1994-2004 period. A careful statistical study relating local
       changes in lead exposure to local crime rates estimates the
       fraction of the crime decline due to lead reduction as greater than
       90 percent.^[12]

Arrests[edit]

   Each state has a set of statutes enforceable within its own borders. A
   state has no jurisdiction outside of its borders, even though still in
   the United States. It must request extradition from the state in which
   the suspect has fled. In 2014, there were 186,873 felony suspects
   outside specific states jurisdiction against whom no extradition would
   be sought. Philadelphia has about 20,000 of these since it is near a
   border with four other states. The cost of extradition is estimated to
   cost a few hundred dollars per case.^[17]

   persons were male and 37.1% were female.^[21]

   For violent crime by race in 2011, 59.4% of those arrested were white,
   38.3% were black, and 2.2% were of other races.^[25] For persons
   arrested for homicide in 2011, 49.7% were black, 48% were white, and
   2.3% were of other races.^[25] For persons arrested for rape in 2011,
   65% were white, 32.9% were black, and 2.1% were of other races.^[25]
   For property crime in 2011, 68.1% of arrested persons were white, 29.5%
   were black, and 2.4% were of other races.^[25]

   In 2011, law enforcement reported 6,222 bias-motivated incidents, known
   as hate crimes, for which 5,731 offenders were identified.^[26] Of
   these, 59% were white, 20.9% were black, 7.1% were of various races,
   1.4% were Asian or Pacific Islanders, 0.8% were Native American, and
   10.8% were of unknown race.^[26]

   Reporting at the annual meeting of the American Sociological
   Association (August 3, 2008), sociologists at Bowling Green State
   University found that men who attend college are more likely to commit
   property crimes during their college years than their
   non-college-attending peers. The research draws from three waves of
   data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and
   examines education, crime levels, substance abuse and socializing among
   adolescents and young adults.^[27] Also, according to Naci Mocan of the
   University of Colorado and Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University, "We
   find that unattractive individuals commit more crime in comparison to
   average-looking ones, and very attractive individuals commit less crime
   in comparison to those who are average-looking."^[28]

Crime victimology[edit]

   This graph shows the homicide victimization rate for whites and blacks,
   according to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.

   In 2011, surveys indicated more than 5.8 million violent victimizations
   and 17.1 million property victimizations took place in the United
   States; according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, each property
   victimization corresponded to one household, while violent
   victimizations is the number of victims of a violent crime.^[29]

   Patterns are found within the victimology of crime in the United
   States. Overall, males, people with lower incomes, those younger than
   25, and non-whites were more likely to report being the victim of
   crime.^[29] Income, gender, and age had the most dramatic effect on the
   chances of a person being victimized by crime, while the characteristic
   of race depended upon the crime being committed.^[29]

   In terms of gender, males were more likely to become crime victims than
   were females,^[30] with 79% percent of all murder victims being male.
   Males were twice as likely to be carjacked as females.^[30] In terms of
   income, households with a 2008 income of less than $15,000 were
   significantly more likely to have their homes burgled.^[30]

   Concerning age, those younger than twenty-five were more likely to fall
   victim to crime, especially violent crime.^[31] The chances of being
   victimized by violent crime decreased far more substantially with age
   than the chances of becoming the victim of property crime.^[31] For
   example, 3.03% of crimes committed against a young person were theft,
   while 20% of crimes committed against an elderly person were
   theft.^[31]

   Bias motivation reports showed that of the 7,254 hate crimes reported
   in 2011, 47.7% (3,465) were motivated by race, with 72% (2,494) of
   race-motivated incidents being anti-black.^[26] In addition, 20.8%
   (1,508) of hate crimes were motivated by sexual orientation, with 57.8%
   (871) of orientation-motivated incidents being anti-male
   homosexual.^[26] The third largest motivation factor for hate crime was
   religion, representing 18.2% (1,318) incidents, with 62.2% (820) of
   religion-motivated incidents being anti-Jewish.^[26]

   As of 2007, violent crime against homeless people is
   increasing.^[32]^[33] The rate of such documented crimes in 2005 was
   30% higher than of those in 1999.^[34] 75% of all perpetrators are
   under the age of 25. Studies and surveys indicate that homeless people
   have a much higher criminal victimization rate than the non-homeless,
   but that most incidents never get reported to authorities.^[citation
   needed] In recent years, largely due to the efforts of the National
   Coalition for the Homeless (NCH) and academic researchers the problem
   of violence against the homeless has gained national attention. The NCH
   called deliberate attacks against the homeless hate crimes in their
   report Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA (they retain the
   definition of the American Congress).^[citation needed] The Center for
   the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San
   Bernardino in conjunction with the NCH found that 155 homeless people
   were killed by non-homeless people in "hate killings", while 76 people
   were killed in all the other traditional hate crime homicide categories
   such as race and religion, combined.^[33] The CSHE contends that
   negative and degrading portrayals of the homeless contribute to a
   climate where violence takes place.

   The likelihood of falling victim to crime relates to both demographic
   and geographic characteristics.^[1] Overall, men, minorities, the
   young, and those in urban areas are more likely to be crime
   victims.^[1] The likelihood of perpetrating crime also relates to
   demography. Also, Human Rights Watch has reported that much of the rape
   in prison is black against white: "Past studies have documented the
   prevalence of black on white sexual aggression in prison. These
   findings are further confirmed by Human Rights Watch's own research.
   Overall, our correspondence and interviews with white, black, and
   Hispanic inmates convince us that white inmates are disproportionately
   targeted for abuse. Although many whites reported being raped by white
   inmates, black on white abuse appears to be more common. To a much
   lesser extent, non-Hispanic whites also reported being victimized by
   Hispanic inmates."^[35] Critics such as Jared Taylor contend that the
   media downplays such violence against whites.

   In 2010, according to the UNODC, 67.5% of all homicides in the United
   States were perpetrated using a firearm.^[36]

Incarceration[edit]

   population of 100,000 in 2008.^[37]
   As of 2001, the chances of going to prison in percentages for various
   demographic groups

   The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world
   (which includes pre-trial detainees and sentenced prisoners).^[38] As
   of 2009, 2.3 million people were incarcerated in the United States,
   including federal and state prisons and local jails, creating an
   incarceration rate of 793 persons per 100,000 of national
   population.^[38] During 2011, 1.6 million people were incarcerated
   under the jurisdiction of federal and state authorities.^[39] At the
   end of 2011, 492 persons per 100,000 U.S. residents were incarcerated
   in federal and state prisons.^[39] Of the 1.6 million state and federal
   prisoners, nearly 1.4 million people were under state jurisdiction,
   while 215,000 were under federal jurisdiction.^[39] Demographically,
   nearly 1.5 million prisoners were male, and 115,000 were female, while
   581,000 prisoners were black, 516,000 were white, and 350,000 were
   Hispanic.^[39]

   Among the 1.35 million sentenced state prisoners in 2011, 725,000
   people were incarcerated for violent crimes, 250,000 were incarcerated
   for property crimes, 237,000 people were incarcerated for drug crimes,
   and 150,000 were incarcerated for other offenses.^[39] Of the 200,000
   sentenced federal prisoners in 2011, 95,000 were incarcerated for drug
   crimes, 69,000 were incarcerated for public order offenses, 15,000 were
   incarcerated for violent crimes, and 11,000 were incarcerated for
   property crimes.^[39]

International comparison[edit]

   The manner in which America's crime rate compared to other countries of
   similar wealth and development depends on the nature of the crime used
   in the comparison.^[40] Overall crime statistic comparisons are
   difficult to conduct, as the definition and categorization of crimes
   varies across countries. Thus an agency in a foreign country may
   include crimes in its annual reports which the United States omits, and
   vice-versa.

   Some countries such as Canada, however, have similar definitions of
   what constitutes a violent crime, and nearly all countries had the same
   definition of the characteristics that constitutes a
   homicide.^[citation needed] Overall the total crime rate of the United
   States is similar to that of other industrialized countries. Some types
   of reported property crime in the U.S. survey as lower than in Germany
   or Canada, yet the homicide rate in the United States is substantially
   higher.

Homicide[edit]

   The US homicide rate, which has declined substantially since 1992 from
   a rate per 100,000 persons of 9.8 to 4.8 in 2010, is still among the
   highest in the industrialized world. There were 14,748 homicides in the
   United States in 2010, including non-negligent manslaughter.^[41]
   (666,160 murders from 1960 to 1996).^[42] In 2004, there were 5.5
   homicides for every 100,000 persons, roughly three times as high as
   Canada (1.9) and six times as high as Germany (0.9).^[43]^[44] A closer
   look at The National Archive of Criminal Justice Data indicates that
   per-capita homicide rates over the last 30 plus years on average, of
   major cities, New Orleans' average annual per capita homicide rate of
   52 murders per 100,000 people overall (1980–2012) is the highest of
   U.S. cities with average annual homicide totals that were among the top
   10 highest during the same period.

   Year 2010 2007 2007 2006 2012 2012 2004 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010

   In the United States, the number of homicides where the victim and
   offender relationship was undetermined has been increasing since 1999
   but has not reached the levels experienced in the early 1990s. In 14%
   of all murders, the victim and the offender were strangers. Spouses and
   family members made up about 15% of all victims, about one-third of the
   victims were acquaintances of the assailant, and the victim and
   offender relationship was undetermined in over one-third of homicides.
   Gun involvement in homicides were gang-related homicides which
   increased after 1980, homicides that occurred during the commission of
   a felony which increased from 55% in 1985 to 77% in 2005, homicides
   resulting from arguments which declined to the lowest levels recorded
   recently, and homicides resulting from other circumstances which
   remained relatively constant. Because gang killing has become a normal
   part of inner cities, many including police hold preconceptions about
   the causes of death in inner cities. When a death is labeled
   gang-related it lowers the chances that it will be investigated and
   increases the chances that the perpetrator will remain at large. In
   addition, victims of gang killings often determine the priority a case
   will be given by police. Jenkins (1988) argues that many serial murder
   cases remain unknown to police and that cases involving Black offenders
   and victims are especially likely to escape official attention.^[53]

Violent crime[edit]

   See also: Violent crime in the United States and Gun violence in the
   United States
   The burglary rates of selected industrialized countries as published by
   the US Bureau of Justice Statistics

   The reported US violent crime rate includes murder, rape and sexual
   assault, robbery, and assault,^[54] whereas the Canadian violent crime
   rate includes all categories of assault, including Assault level 1
   (i.e., assault not using a weapon and not resulting in serious bodily
   harm).^[43]^[44] A Canadian government study concluded that direct
   comparison of the 2 countries' violent crime totals or rates was
   "inappropriate".^[55]

   France and the U.S. do not count minor violence,^[citation needed] such
   as punching or slapping, as assault, whereas Austria, Germany, and
   Finland do count such occurrences.^[56]

   Crime rates are necessarily altered by averaging neighborhood higher or
   lower local rates over a larger population which includes the entire
   city. Having small pockets of dense crime may lower a city's average
   crime rate.

Property crime[edit]

   According to a 2004 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, looking
   at the period from 1981 to 1999, the United States had a lower surveyed
   residential burglary rate in 1998 than Scotland, England, Canada, the
   Netherlands, and Australia. The other two countries included in the
   study, Sweden and Switzerland, had only slightly lower burglary rates.
   (Note: The rate of burglary in police records remained higher in the
   U.S. than most other countries during the study period (see graph)).
   For the first nine years of the study period the same surveys of the
   public showed only Australia with rates higher than the U.S. The
   authors noted various problems in doing the comparisons including
   infrequent data points (The U.S. performed 5 surveys from 1995 to 1999
   when its rate dipped below Canada's while Canada ran a single telephone
   survey during that period for comparison).^[40]

Physical abuse and neglect of children[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (September 2014)

   According to a 2001 report from UNICEF, the United States has the
   highest rate of deaths from child abuse and neglect of any
   industrialized nation, at 2.4 per 100,000 children; France has 1.4,
   Japan 1, UK 0.9 and Germany 0.8. According to the US Department of
   Health, the state of Texas has the highest death rate, at 4.05 per
   100,000 children, New York has 2.46, Oregon 1.49 and New Hampshire
   0.35. ^[57] A UNICEF report on child wellbeing stated that the United
   States and the United Kingdom ranked lowest among industrial nations
   with respect to the wellbeing of children.^[58]

Geography of crime[edit]

   Crime rates vary in the United States depending on the type of
   community.^[59] Within metropolitan statistical areas, both violent and
   property crime rates are higher than the national average; in cities
   located outside metropolitan areas, violent crime was lower than the
   national average, while property crime was higher.^[59] For rural
   areas, both property and violent crime rates were lower than the
   national average.^[59]

Regions[edit]

   For regional comparisons, the FBI divides the United States into four
   regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.^[60] For 2011, the region
   with the lowest violent crime was the Midwest, with a rate of 349.9 per
   100,000 residents, while the region with the highest violent crime rate
   was the South, with a rate of 428.8 per 100,000.^[60] For 2011, the
   region with the lowest property crime rate was the Northeast, with a
   rate of 2,121.8 per 100,000 residents, while the region with the
   highest property crime rate was the South, with a rate of 3,370.8 per
   100,000.^[60]

               >700-800
                         >800

   Crime rates vary greatly among U.S. states.^[61] In 2011, the state
   with the lowest violent crime rate was Maine, with a rate of 123.2 per
   100,000 residents, while the state with the highest violent crime rate
   was Tennessee, with a rate of 608.2 per 100,000.^[61] However, the
   District of Columbia, the U.S. capital district, had a violent crime
   rate of 1,202.1 per 100,000 in 2011.^[61] In 2011, the state with the
   highest property crime rate was South Carolina, with a rate of 3,904.2
   per 100,000, while the state with the lowest property crime rate was
   South Dakota, with a rate of 1,817.7 per 100,000.^[61] However, Puerto
   Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, had a property
   crime rate of 1,395.2 per 100,000 in 2011.^[61]

   A closer look at annual per capita homicide rates for each state from
   FBI Uniform Crime Reports Bureau of Justice Statistics indicate that
   Louisiana's per capita homicide rate has ranked 1st every single year
   from 1989-2012, which is 24 consecutive years.

Metropolitan areas[edit]

   Further information: United States cities by crime rate

   Crime in metropolitan statistical areas tends to be above the national
   average; however, wide variance exists among and within metropolitan
   areas.^[62] Some responding jurisdictions report very low crime rates,
   while others have considerably higher rates; these variations are due
   to many factors beyond population.^[62] FBI crime statistics
   publications strongly caution against comparison rankings of cities,
   counties, metropolitan statistical areas, and other reporting units
   without considering factors other than simply population.^[62] For
   2011, the metropolitan statistical area with the highest violent crime
   rate was the Memphis metropolitan area, with a rate of 980.4 per
   100,000 residents, while the metropolitan statistical area with the
   lowest violent crime rate was Logan metropolitan area, with a rate of
   47.7.^[63]^[64]

   It is quite common for crime in American cities to be highly
   concentrated in a few, often economically disadvantaged areas. For
   example, San Mateo County, California had a population of approximately
   707,000 and 17 homicides in 2001. Six of these 17 homicides took place
   in poor East Palo Alto, which had a population of roughly 30,000. So,
   while East Palo Alto accounted for a mere 4.2% of the population, about
   one-third of the homicides took place there.^[65]

Number and growth of criminal laws[edit]

   There are conflicting opinions on the number of federal
   crimes,^[66]^[67] but many have argued that there has been explosive
   growth and it has become overwhelming.^[68]^[69]^[70] In 1982, the U.S.
   Justice Department could not come up with a number, but estimated 3,000
   crimes in the United States Code.^[66]^[67]^[71] In 1998, the American
   Bar Association (ABA) said that it was likely much higher than 3,000,
   but didn't give a specific estimate.^[66]^[67] In 2008, the Heritage
   Foundation published a report that put the number at a minimum of
   4,450.^[67] When staff for a task force of the U.S. House Judiciary
   Committee asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to update its
   2008 calculation of criminal offenses in the United States Code in
   2013, the CRS responded that they lack the manpower and resources to
   accomplish the task.^[72]
