   Labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in
   many industries in the United States. Their activity today centers on
   collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for
   their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with
   management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also
   typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state
   and federal level. Organized labor usually supports Democratic Party
   candidates in elections.

   Most unions in the United States are aligned with one of two larger
   umbrella organizations: the AFL-CIO created in 1955, and the Change to
   Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate
   policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and
   Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially
   concerned with global trade issues.

   In 2013 there were 14.5 million members in the U.S., compared with 17.7
   million in 1983. In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a
   union in the United States (or total labor union "density") was 11.3%,
   compared to 20.1% in 1983.^[1] From a global perspective, the density
   in 2010 was 11.4% in the U.S., 18.4% in Germany, 27.5% in Canada, and
   70% in Finland.^[2] Union membership in the private sector has fallen
   under 7%^[3] — levels not seen since 1932.

   In the 21st century the most prominent unions are among public sector
   employees such as city employees, government workers, teachers and
   police. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male, and
   residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.^[4] Union
   workers average 10-30% higher pay than non-union in the United States
   after controlling for individual, job, and labor market
   characteristics.^[5]

   Although much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s,
   American unions remain a political factor, both through mobilization of
   their own memberships and through coalitions with like-minded activist
   organizations around issues such as immigrant rights, trade policy,
   health care, and living wage campaigns. Of special concern are efforts
   by cities and states to reduce the pension obligations owed to
   unionized workers who retire in the future.^[6] Republicans elected
   with Tea Party support in 2010 have launched major efforts against
   public sector unions due in part to state government pension
   obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too
   powerful.^[7]

History[edit]

   Main article: Labor history of the United States

   Unions began forming in the mid-19th century in response to the social
   and economic impact of the industrial revolution. National labor unions
   began to form in the post-Civil War Era. The Knights of Labor emerged
   as a major force in the late 1880s, but it collapsed because of poor
   organization, lack of effective leadership, disagreement over goals,
   and strong opposition from employers and government forces.

   The American Federation of Labor, founded in 1886 and led by Samuel
   Gompers until his death in 1924, proved much more durable. It arose as
   a loose coalition of various local unions. It helped coordinate and
   support strikes and eventually became a major player in national
   politics, usually on the side of the Democrats.

   American labor unions benefitted greatly from the New Deal policies of
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s. The Wagner Act, in particular,
   legally protected the right of unions to organize. Unions from this
   point developed increasingly closer ties to the Democratic Party, and
   are considered a backbone element of the New Deal Coalition.

Post-war[edit]

   Pro-business conservatives gained control of Congress in 1946, and in
   1947 passed the Taft-Hartley Act, drafted by Senator Robert A. Taft.
   President Truman vetoed it but the Conservative coalition overrode the
   veto. The new law (still in effect today) banned union contributions to
   political candidates, restricted the power of unions to call strikes
   that "threatened national security," and forced the expulsion of
   Communist union leaders. The unions campaigned vigorously for years to
   repeal the law but failed. During the late 1950s, the Landrum Griffith
   Act of 1959 passed in the wake of Congressional investigations of
   corruption and undemocratic internal politics in the Teamsters and
   other unions.^[8]^[9]

   The percentage of workers belonging to a union (or "density") in the
   United States peaked in 1954 at almost 35% and the total number of
   union members peaked in 1979 at an estimated 21.0 million. Membership
   has declined since (currently 14.5 million and 11.3% of the labor
   force^[3]). Private sector union membership then began a steady decline
   that continues into the 2010s, but the membership of public sector
   unions grew steadily (now 37%).^[10]

   After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and
   high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming
   steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled
   from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million
   in 2009.^[11] Adding in the 3.7 million federal civilian employees, in
   2010 8.4 million government workers were represented by unions,^[12]
   including 31% of federal workers, 35% of state workers and 46% of local
   workers.^[13] As Daniel Disalvo notes, "In today's public sector, good
   pay, generous benefits, and job security make possible a stable
   middle-class existence for nearly everyone from janitors to
   jailors."^[14]

   By the 1970s, a rapidly increasing flow of imports (such as
   automobiles, steel and electronics from Germany and Japan, and clothing
   and shoes from Asia) undercut American producers.^[15] By the 1980s
   there was a large-scale shift in employment with fewer workers in
   high-wage sectors and more in the low-wage sectors.^[16] Many companies
   closed or moved factories to Southern states (where unions were
   weak),^[17] countered the threat of a strike by threatening to close or
   move a plant,^[18] or moved their factories offshore to low-wage
   countries.^[19] The number of major strikes and lockouts fell by 97%
   from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010.^[18]^[20] On the
   political front, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic
   Party, and pro-Union liberal Republicans faded away.^[21] Union
   membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically,
   though after 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal,
   state and local governments.^[22]^[23] The intellectual mood in the
   1970s and 1980s favored deregulation and free competition.^[24]
   Numerous industries were deregulated, including airlines, trucking,
   railroads and telephones, over the objections of the unions
   involved.^[25] The climax came when President Ronald Reagan—a former
   union president—broke the Professional Air Traffic Controllers
   Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981, dealing a major blow to
   unions.^[20]^[26]

   Republicans, using conservative think tanks as idea farms, began to
   push through legislative blueprints to curb the power of public
   employee unions as well as eliminate business
   regulations.^[19]^[27]^[28]

   leaders in the United States

   Today most labor unions in the United States are members of one of two
   larger umbrella organizations: the American Federation of
   Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) or the Change to
   Win Federation, which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005-2006. Both
   organizations advocate policies and legislation favorable to workers in
   the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics
   favoring the Democratic party but not exclusively so. The AFL-CIO is
   especially concerned with global trade and economic issues.

   Private sector unions are regulated by the National Labor Relations Act
   (NLRA), passed in 1935 and amended since then. The law is overseen by
   the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal
   agency. Public sector unions are regulated partly by federal and partly
   by state laws. In general they have shown robust growth rates, for
   wages and working conditions are set through negotiations with elected
   local and state officials. The unions' political power thus comes into
   play, and of course the local government cannot threaten to move
   elsewhere, nor is there any threat from foreign competition.

   To join a traditional labor union, workers must either be given
   voluntary recognition from their employer or have a majority of workers
   in a bargaining unit vote for union representation. In either case, the
   government must then certify the newly formed union. Other forms of
   unionism include minority unionism, Solidarity unionism, and the
   practices of organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World,
   which do not always follow traditional organizational models.

   Public sector worker unions are governed by labor laws and labor boards
   in each of the 50 states. Northern states typically model their laws
   and boards after the NLRA and the NLRB. In other states, public workers
   have no right to establish a union as a legal entity. (About 40% of
   public employees in the USA do not have the right to organize a legally
   established union.)

   The median weekly income for union workers was $943 in 2012, compared
   with $742 for nonunion workers.^[30]

   A review conducted by the federal government^[vague] on pay scale shows
   that employees in a labor union earn up to 33% more income than their
   nonunion counterparts, as well as having more job security, safer and
   higher-quality work conditions, and additional benefits.^[31]

Labor negotiations[edit]

   Once the union has won the support of a majority of the bargaining unit
   and is certified in a workplace, it has the sole authority to negotiate
   the conditions of employment. However, under the NLRA, if a minority of
   employees voted for a union, those employees can then form a union
   which represents the rights of only those members who voted for the
   union. This minority model was once widely used, but was discarded when
   unions began to consistently win majority support. Unions are beginning
   to revisit the "members only" model of unionism because of new changes
   to labor law which unions view as curbing workers' ability to organize.

   The employer and the union write the terms and conditions of employment
   in a legally binding contract. When disputes arise over the contract,
   most contracts call for the parties to resolve their differences
   through a grievance process to see if the dispute can be mutually
   resolved. If the union and the employer still cannot settle the matter,
   either party can choose to send the dispute to arbitration, where the
   case is argued before a neutral third party.

   Right-to-work statutes forbid unions from negotiating agency shops.
   Thus, while unions do exist in "right-to-work" states, they are
   typically weaker.

   Members of labor unions enjoy "Weingarten Rights." If management
   questions the union member on a matter that may lead to discipline or
   other changes in working conditions, union members can request
   representation by a union representative. Weingarten Rights are named
   for the first Supreme Court decision to recognize those rights.^[32]

   The NLRA goes farther in protecting the right of workers to organize
   unions. It protects the right of workers to engage in any "concerted
   activity" for mutual aid or protection. Thus, no union connection is
   needed. Concerted activity "in its inception involves only a speaker
   and a listener, for such activity is an indispensable preliminary step
   to employee self-organization."^[33]

   Unions are currently advocating new federal legislation, the Employee
   Free Choice Act (EFCA), that would allow workers to elect union
   representation by simply signing a support card (card check). The
   current process established by federal law requires at least 30% of
   employees to sign cards for the union, then wait 45 to 90 days for a
   federal official to conduct a secret ballot election in which a simple
   majority of the employees must vote for the union in order to obligate
   the employer to bargain.

   Unions report that, under the present system, many employers use the 45
   to 90 day period to conduct anti-union campaigns. Some opponents of
   this legislation fear that removing secret balloting from the process
   will lead to the intimidation and coercion of workers on behalf of the
   unions. During the 2008 elections, the Employee Free Choice Act had
   widespread support of many legislators in the House and Senate, and of
   the President. Since then, support for the "card check" provisions of
   the EFCA subsided substantially.

Membership[edit]

   See also: Union affiliation by U.S. state

   Union membership had been declining in the US since 1954, and since
   1967, as union membership rates decreased, middle class incomes shrank
   correspondingly.^[34] In 2007, the labor department reported the first
   increase in union memberships in 25 years and the largest increase
   since 1979. Most of the recent gains in union membership have been in
   the service sector while the number of unionized employees in the
   manufacturing sector has declined. Most of the gains in the service
   sector have come in West Coast states like California where union
   membership is now at 16.7% compared with a national average of about
   12.1%.^[35] Historically, the rapid growth of public employee unions
   since the 1960s has served to mask an even more dramatic decline in
   private-sector union membership.

   At the apex of union density in the 1940s, only about 9.8% of public
   employees were represented by unions, while 33.9% of private,
   non-agricultural workers had such representation. In this decade, those
   proportions have essentially reversed, with 36% of public workers being
   represented by unions while private sector union density had plummeted
   to around 7%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics most recent survey
   indicates that union membership in the US has risen to 12.4% of all
   workers, from 12.1% in 2007. For a short period, private sector union
   membership rebounded, increasing from 7.5% in 2007 to 7.6% in
   2008.^[36] However, that trend has since reversed. In 2013 there were
   14.5 million members in the U.S., compared with 17.7 million in 1983.
   In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a union was 11.3%,
   compared to 20.1% in 1983. The rate for the private sector was 6.7%,
   and for the public sector 35.3%.^[1]

Labor education programs[edit]

   In the US, labor education programs such as the Harvard Trade Union
   Program ^[37] created in 1942 by Harvard University professor John
   Thomas Dunlop sought to educate union members to deal with important
   contemporary workplace and labor law issues of the day. The Harvard
   Trade Union Program is currently part of a broader initiative at
   Harvard Law School called the Labor and Worklife Program^[38] that
   deals with a wide variety of labor and employment issues from union
   pension investment funds to the effects of nanotechnology on labor
   markets and the workplace.

Jurisdiction[edit]

   Labor unions use the term jurisdiction to refer to their claims to
   represent workers who perform a certain type of work and the right of
   their members to perform such work. For example, the work of unloading
   containerized cargo at United States ports, which the International
   Longshoremen's Association the International Longshore and Warehouse
   Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have claimed
   rightfully should be assigned to workers they represent. A
   jurisdictional strike is a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a
   union to assert its members' right to such job assignments and to
   protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or
   to unorganized workers. Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in
   the United States in the construction industry.^[39]

   Unions also use jurisdiction to refer to the geographical boundaries of
   their operations, as in those cases in which a national or
   international union allocates the right to represent workers among
   different local unions based on the place of those workers' employment,
   either along geographical lines or by adopting the boundaries between
   political jurisdictions.^[39]

Possible causes of drop in membership[edit]

   Rise and fall of union membership in the United States.

   Although most industrialized countries have seen a drop in unionization
   rates, the drop in union density (the unionized proportion of the
   working population) has been more significant in the United States than
   elsewhere. Dropping unionization rates cannot be attributed entirely to
   changing market structures. In fact, scholars have shown the tremendous
   complexity inherent in explaining the decline of union density.

Popularity[edit]

   A historical comparison of union membership as a percentage of all
   workers and union support in the United States.

   Public approval of unions climbed during the 1980s much as it did in
   other industrialized nations,^[40] but declined to below 50% for the
   first time in 2009 during the Great Recession. It is not clear if this
   is a long term trend or a function of a high unemployment rate which
   historically correlates with lower public approval of labor
   unions.^[41] Another factor argued by both sides is business interests
   and supporters work together to undermine, challenge and campaign
   against unions and the benefits by "corporatizing" its leadership by
   calling union leadership "bosses". Drawing parallels between what a
   worker views an employer or "boss" being responsible for a less than
   satisfactory work life and the union being equal partnership in that
   dissatisfaction, may contribute to loss of faith in unions.

   One explanation for loss of public support is simply the lack of union
   power or critical mass. No longer do a sizable percentage of American
   workers belong to unions, or have family members who do. Unions no
   longer carry the “threat effect”: the power of unions to raise wages of
   non-union shops by virtue of the threat of unions to organize those
   shops.^[41]

Recent Polls of Public Opinion and Labor Unions[edit]

   A New York Times/CBS Poll found that 60% of Americans opposed
   restricting collective bargaining while 33% were for it. The poll also
   found that 56% of Americans opposed reducing pay of public employees
   compared to 37%. The details of the poll also stated that 26% of those
   surveyed, thought pay and benefits for public employees were too high,
   25% thought too low, and 36% thought about right. Mark Tapscott of the
   Washington Examiner criticized the poll, accusing it of over-sampling
   union and public employee households.^[42]

   A Gallup poll released on March 9, 2011, showed that Americans were
   more likely to support limiting the collective bargaining powers of
   state employee unions to balance a state's budget (49%) than disapprove
   of such a measure (45%), while 6% had no opinion. 66% of Republicans
   approved of such a measure as did 51% of independents. Only 31% of
   Democrats approved.^[43]

   A Gallup poll released on March 11, 2011, showed that nationwide,
   Americans were more likely to give unions a negative word or phrase
   when describing them (38%) than a positive word or phrase (34%). 17%
   were neutral and 12% didn't know. Republicans were much more likely to
   say a negative term (58%) than Democrats (19%). Democrats were much
   more likely to say a positive term (49%) than Republicans (18%).^[44]

   A nationwide Gallup poll (margin of error ±4%) released on April 1,
   2011,^[45] showed the following;
     * When asked if they supported the labor unions or the governors in
       state disputes; 48% said they supported the unions, 39% said the
       governors, 4% said neither, and 9% had no opinion.
     * Women supported the governors much less than men. 45% of men said
       they supported the governors, while 46% said they supported the
       unions. This compares to only 33% of women who said they supported
       the governors and 50% who said they supported the unions.
     * All areas of the US (East, Midwest, South, West) were more likely
       to support unions than the governors. The largest gap being in the
       East with 35% supporting the governors and 52% supporting the
       unions, and the smallest gap being in the West with 41% supporting
       the governors and 44% the unions.
     * 18- to 34-year-olds were much more likely to support unions than
       those over 34 years of age. Only 27% of 18- to 34-year-olds
       supported the governors, while 61% supported the unions. Americans
       ages 35 to 54 slightly supported the unions more than governors,
       with 40% supporting the governors and 43% the unions. Americans 55
       and older were tied when asked, with 45% supporting the governors
       and 45% the unions.
     * Republicans were much more likely to support the governors when
       asked with 65% supporting the governors and 25% the unions.
       Independents slightly supported unions more, with 40% supporting
       the governors and 45% the unions. Democrats were overwhelmingly in
       support of the unions. 70% of Democrats supported the unions, while
       only 19% supported the governors.
     * Those who said they were following the situation not too closely or
       not at all supported the unions over governors, with a 14–point
       (45% to 31%) margin. Those who said they were following the
       situation somewhat closely supported the unions over governors by a
       52–41 margin. Those who said that they were following the situation
       very closely were only slightly more likely to support the unions
       over the governors, with a 49-48 margin.

   A nationwide Gallup poll released on August 31, 2011, revealed the
   following:^[46]
     * 52% of Americans approved of labor unions, unchanged from 2010.
     * 78% of Democrats approved of labor unions, up from 71% in 2010.
     * 52% of Independents approved of labor unions, up from 49% in 2010.
     * 26% of Republicans approved of labor unions, down from 34% in 2010.

   A nationwide Gallup poll released on September 1, 2011, revealed the
   following:^[47]
     * 55% of Americans believed that labor unions will become weaker in
       the United States as time goes by, an all time high. This compared
       to 22% who said their power would stay the same, and 20% who said
       they would get stronger.
     * The majority of Republicans and Independents believed labor unions
       would further weaken by a 58% and 57% percentage margin
       respectively. A plurality of Democrats believed the same, at 46%.
     * 42% of Americans want labor unions to have less influence, tied for
       the all-time high set in 2009. 30% wanted more influence and 25%
       wanted the same amount of influence.
     * The majority of Republicans wanted labor unions to have less
       influence, at 69%.
     * A plurality of Independents wanted labor unions to have less
       influence, at 40%.
     * A plurality of Democrats wanted labor unions to have more
       influence, at 45%.
     * The majority of Americans believed labor unions mostly helped
       members of unions by a 68 to 28 margin.
     * A plurality of Americans believed labor unions mostly helped the

Institutional environments[edit]

   A broad range of forces have been identified as potential contributors
   to the drop in union density across countries. Sano and Williamson
   outline quantitative studies that assess the relevance of these factors
   across countries.^[48] The first relevant set of factors relate to the
   receptiveness of unions’ institutional environments. For example, the
   presence of a Ghent system (where unions are responsible for the
   distribution of unemployment insurance) and of centralized collective
   bargaining (organized at a national or industry level as opposed to
   local or firm level) have both been shown to give unions more
   bargaining power and to correlate positively to higher rates of union
   density.^[48]

   Unions have enjoyed higher rates of success in locations where they
   have greater access to the workplace as an organizing space (as
   determined both by law and by employer acceptance), and where they
   benefit from a corporatist relationship to the state and are thus
   allowed to participate more directly in the official governance
   structure. Moreover, the fluctuations of business cycles, particularly
   the rise and fall of unemployment rates and inflation, are also closely
   linked to changes in union density.^[48]

Labor legislation[edit]

   Labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan attributes the drop to the long-term
   effects of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which slowed and then halted
   labor's growth and then, over many decades, enabled management to roll
   back labor's previous gains.^[49]

     First, it ended organizing on the grand, 1930s scale. It outlawed
     mass picketing, secondary strikes of neutral employers, sit downs:
     in short, everything [Congress of Industrial Organizations founder
     John L.] Lewis did in the 1930s.

     The second effect of Taft-Hartley was subtler and slower-working. It
     was to hold up any new organizing at all, even on a quiet, low-key
     scale. For example, Taft-Hartley ended "card checks." … Taft-Hartley
     required hearings, campaign periods, secret-ballot elections, and
     sometimes more hearings, before a union could be officially
     recognized.
     It also allowed and even encouraged employers to threaten workers
     who want to organize. Employers could hold "captive meetings," bring
     workers into the office and chew them out for thinking about the
     Union.
     And Taft-Hartley led to the "union-busting" that started in the late
     1960s and continues today. It started when a new "profession" of
     labor consultants began to convince employers that they could
     violate the [pro-labor 1935] Wagner Act, fire workers at will, fire
     them deliberately for exercising their legal rights, and nothing
     would happen. The Wagner Act had never had any real sanctions.
     […]
     So why hadn't employers been violating the Wagner Act all along?
     Well, at first, in the 1930s and 1940s, they tried, and they got
     riots in the streets: mass picketing, secondary strikes, etc. But
     after Taft-Hartley, unions couldn't retaliate like this, or they
     would end up with penalty fines and jail sentences.^[49]

   In general, scholars debate the influence of politics in determining
   union strength in the US and other countries. One argument is that
   political parties play an expected role in determining union strength,
   with left-wing governments generally promoting greater union density,
   while others contest this finding by pointing out important
   counterexamples and explaining the reverse causality inherent in this
   relationship.^[50]

Economic globalization[edit]

   More recently, as unions have become increasingly concerned with the
   impacts of market integration on their well-being, scholars have begun
   to assess whether popular concerns about a global “race to the bottom”
   are reflected in cross-country comparisons of union strength. These
   scholars use foreign direct investment (FDI) and the size of a
   country’s international trade as a percentage of its GDP to assess a
   country’s relative degree of market integration. These researchers
   typically find that globalization does affect union density, but is
   dependent on other factors, such as unions’ access to the workplace and
   the centralization of bargaining.^[51]

   Sano and Williamson argue that globalization’s impact is conditional
   upon a country’s labor history.^[52] In the United States in
   particular, which has traditionally had relatively low levels of union
   density, globalization did not appear to significantly affect union
   density.

Employer strategies[edit]

   Illegal union firing increased during the Reagan administration and has
   continued since.^[53]

   Studies focusing more narrowly on the U.S. labor movement corroborate
   the comparative findings about the importance of structural factors,
   but tend to emphasize the effects of changing labor markets due to
   globalization to a greater extent. Bronfenbrenner notes that changes in
   the economy, such as increased global competition, capital flight, and
   the transitions from a manufacturing to a service economy and to a
   greater reliance on transitory and contingent workers, accounts for
   only a third of the decline in union density.^[54]

   Bronfenbrenner claims that the federal government in the 1980s was
   largely responsible for giving employers the perception that they could
   engage in aggressive strategies to repress the formation of unions.
   Richard Freeman also points to the role of repressive employer
   strategies in reducing unionization, and highlights the way in which a
   state ideology of anti-unionism tacitly accepted these strategies ^[40]

   Goldfield writes that the overall effects of globalization on
   unionization in the particular case of the United States may be
   understated in econometric studies on the subject.^[55] He writes that
   the threat of production shifts reduces unions’ bargaining power even
   if it does not eliminate them, and also claims that most of the effects
   of globalization on labor’s strength are indirect. They are most
   present in change towards a neoliberal political context that has
   promoted the deregulation and privatization of some industries and
   accepted increased employer flexibility in labor markets.

Union responses to globalization[edit]

   Studies done by Kate Bronfenbrenner at Cornell University show the
   adverse effects of globalization towards unions due to illegal threats
   of firing.^[56]

   Regardless of the actual impact of market integration on union density
   or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged in a variety
   of strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor
   regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of
   this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives
   such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the
   Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In
   both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but
   to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in
   the agreement if one were to pass.^[57]

   However, Mayer has written that it was precisely unions’ opposition to
   NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor’s ability to influence
   the debate on labor standards in a significant way.^[58] During
   Clinton’s presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a
   side deal to provide for a kind of international social charter, a set
   of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and
   through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade
   representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he
   could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they
   were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.^[58]

   When it became clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an
   agreement, some critics from the labor movement would not settle for
   any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted
   to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for
   NAFTA’s rejection in Congress.^[58] Ultimately, the ambivalence of
   labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to
   believe that strengthening NAFTA’s labor side agreement too much would
   cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats,
   and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from
   Mexico.^[59]

   Graubart writes that, despite unions’ open disappointment with the
   outcome of this labor-side negotiation, labor activists, including the
   AFL-CIO have used the side agreement’s citizen petition process to
   highlight ongoing political campaigns and struggles in their home
   countries.^[60] He claims that despite the relative weakness of the
   legal provisions themselves, the side-agreement has served a
   legitimizing functioning, giving certain social struggles a new kind of
   standing.

Transnational labor regulation[edit]

   Unions have recently been engaged in a developing field of
   transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct.
   However, O’Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally
   involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential
   effects.^[61] They worry that these codes could have legitimizing
   effects on companies that don’t actually live up to good practices, and
   that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the
   repression of unions.

   Braun and Gearhart note that although unions do participate in the
   structure of a number of these agreements, their original interest in
   codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other
   non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct would
   be important first steps in creating written principles that a company
   would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but
   did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the
   Fair Labor Association. These authors point out that are motivated by
   power, want to gain insider status politically and are accountable to a
   constituency that requires them to provide them with direct
   benefits.^[62]

   In contrast, activists from the non-governmental sector are motivated
   by ideals, are free of accountability and gain legitimacy from being
   political outsiders. Therefore, the interests of unions are not likely
   to align well with the interests of those who draft and monitor
   corporate codes of conduct.

   Arguing against the idea that high union wages necessarily make
   manufacturing uncompetitive in a globalized economy is labor lawyer
   Thomas Geoghegan. Busting

     unions, in the U.S. manner, as the prime way of competing with China
     and other countries [does not work]. It's no accident that the
     social democracies, Sweden, France, and Germany, which kept on
     paying high wages, now have more industry than the U.S. or the UK. …
     [T]hat's what the U.S. and the UK did: they smashed the unions, in
     the belief that they had to compete on cost. The result? They
     quickly ended up wrecking their industrial base.^[63]

   Unions have made some attempts to organize across borders. Eder
   observes that transnational organizing is not a new phenomenon but has
   been facilitated by technological change.^[64] Nevertheless, he claims
   that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act
   largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the
   global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the
   South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production
   processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different
   regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder
   effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of
   international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need
   not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be
   contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the
   United Auto Workers’ strike against General Motors in 1998, can
   sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways
   that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration.
   Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around
   the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational
   corporation.^[65]
