   Elections to the United States House of Representatives for the 4th
   Congress were held on various dates in each state between August 25,
   1794 (New Hampshire) and September 5, 1795 (Kentucky). The election was
   held during President George Washington's second term. The voters of
   Tennessee elected their first congressional representative (Andrew
   Jackson) on October 7, 1796.

   In the second election for the House of Representatives with organized
   political parties, the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas
   Jefferson, once again defeated the Federalist Party, led by Alexander
   Hamilton, and slightly increased their majority. These new wins by the
   Democratic-Republicans can mostly be attributed to the popularity of
   Jeffersonian ideas of agrarian democracy in the Western territories of
   the United States.

Election summaries[edit]

   During this period, each state fixed its own date for a congressional
   general election. Elections took place both in the even-numbered year
   before and in the odd-numbered year when a Congress convened. In some
   states, the congressional delegation was not elected until after the
   legal start of the Congress (on the 4th day of March in the
   odd-numbered year).

   One new seat was added during the 4th Congress upon the admission of
   Tennessee on June 1, 1796.^[5] Tennessee was not represented in the 1st
   session.

Late elections to 3rd Congress[edit]

Non-voting delegates[edit]

   On September 3, 1796, the 3rd Congress admitted the first Delegate
   after some debate. The individual elected, James White, represented
   voters in the Southwest Territory. He also served during the 4th
   Congress. The delegate was elected by the Territorial legislature.

Massachusetts[edit]

   Massachusetts redistricted between the 3rd and 4th Congress, dividing
   itself into 14 districts. The 12th-14th districts were in the District
   of Maine (the modern State of Maine). A majority was required for
   election. Additional ballots were required in five districts due to the
   majority requirement not being met on the first ballot.

   Theodore Sedgwick (F) of the 1st district resigned upon being elected
   to the Senate and was replaced in a special election by Thomson J.
   Skinner (DR).

   In the 9th district, a petition by various citizens of Massachusetts
   contested the election of Varnum. The Committee on Elections ruled in
   Varnum's favor and added "that the attempt to deprive him of his seat
   was rather the act of malevolence than a desire to promote the public
   good." On January 25, 1797, these words were stricken out and
   expressions of compliment to the sitting Member were substituted, and
   the report was agreed to.^[19]

   Benjamin Goodhue (F) of the 10th district resigned upon being elected
   to the Senate and was replaced in a special election by Samuel Sewall
   (F).

New Hampshire[edit]

   Under New Hampshire's electoral laws, a majority of voters (12.5% of
   votes) was required for election. Only three candidates achieved a
   majority, and so a run-off election was held for the fourth seat.

   elected Absalom Tatom (DR). Tatom, in turn, resigned June 1, 1796 and a
   special election was held to fill that vacancy, won by William F.

Pennsylvania[edit]

   Main article: United States House of Representatives elections in
   Pennsylvania, 1794

   Pennsylvania once again divided itself into districts instead of
   electing representatives at-large, as it had for the 3rd Congress. The
   state divided intself into 12 districts, one of which (the 4th) had two
   seats. Pennsylvania would continue to use one or more plural districts
   until 1842.

   The 2nd seat in the 4th district was disputed between John Richards and

   Sitgreaves (F) leaving the other seat undecided. Morris died on July
   10, 1795, before the House could act. The House Committee on Elections
   ruled in favor of Richards on January 10, 1798.
