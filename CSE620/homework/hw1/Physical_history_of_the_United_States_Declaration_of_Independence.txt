   The signed, Engrossed Copy of the Declaration, now badly faded, is on
   display at the National Archives in Washington, DC.

   The United States Declaration of Independence, which announced that the
   thirteen American colonies then at war with Great Britain were no
   longer a part of the British Empire, exists in a number of drafts,
   handwritten copies, and published broadsides.

Drafts and pre-publication copies[edit]

Composition Draft[edit]

   The Composition Draft

   The earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence is a
   fragment known as the "Composition Draft."^[1] The draft, written in
   June 1776, is in the handwriting of Thomas Jefferson, principal author
   of the Declaration. It was discovered in 1947 by historian Julian P.
   Boyd in the Jefferson papers at the Library of Congress. Boyd was
   examining primary documents for publication in The Papers of Thomas
   Jefferson when he found the document, a piece of paper that contains a
   small part of the text of the Declaration, as well as some unrelated
   notes made by Jefferson.^[2] Prior to Boyd's discovery, the only known
   draft of the Declaration had been a document known as the "Rough Draft"
   (below). The discovery confirmed speculation by historians that
   Jefferson must have written more than one draft of the text.^[2]

   Many of the words from the Composition Draft were ultimately deleted by
   Congress from the final text of the Declaration. Phrases from the
   fragment to survive the editing process include "acquiesce in the
   necessity, which denounces our separation" and "hold them, as we hold
   the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends."^[2]

   Forensic examination has determined that the paper of the Composition
   Draft and the paper of the Rough Draft were made by the same
   manufacturer.^[3] In 1995, conservators at the Library of Congress
   undid some previous restoration work on the fragment and placed it in a
   protective mat. The document is stored in a cold storage vault. When it
   is exhibited, the fragment is placed in a temperature and humidity
   controlled display case.^[3]

Rough Draft[edit]

   The first page of Jefferson's rough draft.

   Thomas Jefferson preserved a four-page draft that late in life he
   called the "original Rough draught."^[4]^[5] Known to historians as the
   Rough Draft, early students of the Declaration believed that this was a
   draft written alone by Jefferson and then presented to the drafting
   committee. Scholars now believe that the Rough Draft was not actually
   an "original Rough draught", but was instead a revised version
   completed by Jefferson after consultation with the committee.^[4] How
   many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text
   was contributed by other committee members, is unknown.

   Jefferson showed the Rough Draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps
   other committee members, who made a few more changes.^[4] Franklin, for
   example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original
   phrase "We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable" to "We hold
   these truths to be self-evident."^[6] Jefferson incorporated these
   changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the
   committee. Jefferson kept the Rough Draft and made additional notes on
   it as Congress revised the text. He also made several copies of the
   Rough Draft without the changes made by Congress, which he sent to
   friends, including Richard Henry Lee and George Wythe, after July 4. At
   some point in the process, Adams also wrote out a copy.^[4]

Fair Copy[edit]

   In 1823, Jefferson wrote a letter to James Madison in which he
   recounted the drafting process. After making alterations to his draft
   as suggested by Franklin and Adams, he recalled that "I then wrote a
   fair copy, reported it to the Committee, and from them, unaltered, to
   Congress."^[7] If Jefferson's memories were correct, and he indeed
   wrote out a fair copy which was shown to the drafting committee and
   then submitted to Congress on June 28, this document has not been
   found.^[8] "If this manuscript still exists," wrote historian Ted
   Widmer, "it is the holy grail of American freedom."^[9]

   The Fair Copy was presumably marked up by Charles Thomson, the
   secretary of the Continental Congress, while Congress debated and
   revised the text.^[10] This document was the one that Congress approved
   on July 4, making it what Boyd called the first "official" copy of the
   Declaration. The Fair Copy was sent to be printed under the title "A
   Declaration by the Representatives of the united states of america, in
   General Congress assembled." Boyd argued that if a document was signed
   in Congress on July 4—which he thought unlikely—it would have been the
   Fair Copy, and probably would have been signed only by John Hancock and
   Thomson.^[11]

   The Fair Copy may have been destroyed in the printing process,^[12] or
   destroyed during the debates in accordance with Congress's secrecy
   rule.^[13]

Broadsides[edit]

   The Declaration was first published as a broadside printed by John
   Dunlap of Philadelphia. One broadside was pasted into Congress's
   journal, making it what Boyd called the "second official version" of
   the Declaration.^[14] Dunlap's broadsides were distributed throughout
   the thirteen states. Upon receiving these broadsides, many states
   issued their own broadside editions.^[15]

Dunlap broadside[edit]

   The Library of Congress's copy of the Dunlap broadside.

   The Dunlap broadsides were the first published copies of the
   Declaration of Independence, printed on the night of July 4, 1776. It
   is unknown exactly how many broadsides were originally printed, but the
   number is estimated at about 200.^[16] John Hancock's eventually famous
   signature was not on this document; his name appeared in type under
   "Signed by Order and in Behalf of the Congress", with secretary Charles
   Thomson listed as a witness.

   On July 4, 1776, Congress ordered the same committee charged with
   writing the document to "superintend and correct the press", that is,
   supervise the printing. Dunlap, an Irish immigrant then 29 years old,
   was tasked with the job; he apparently spent much of the night of July
   4 setting type, correcting it, and running off the broadside
   sheets.^[17]

   "There is evidence it was done quickly, and in excitement—watermarks
   are reversed, some copies look as if they were folded before the ink
   could dry and bits of punctuation move around from one copy to
   another," according to Ted Widmer, author of Ark of the Liberties:
   America and the World. "It is romantic to think that Benjamin Franklin,
   the greatest printer of his day, was there in Dunlap's shop to
   supervise, and that Jefferson, the nervous author, was also close at
   hand."^[17] John Adams later wrote that, "We were all in haste."^[17]
   The Dunlap broadsides were sent across the colonies over the next two
   days, including to Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George
   Washington, who directed that the Declaration be read to the troops.
   Another copy was sent to England.^[17]

   In 1949, 14 copies of the Dunlap broadside were known to exist.^[15]
   The number had increased to 21 by 1975.^[18] There were 24 known copies
   of the Dunlap broadside in 1989, when a 25th broadside was discovered
   behind a painting bought for four dollars at a flea market.

   On July 2, 2009, it was announced that a 26th Dunlap broadside was
   discovered in The National Archives in Kew, England. It is currently
   unknown how this copy came to the archive, but one possibility is that
   it was captured from an American coastal ship intercepted during the
   War of Independence.^[19]^[20]

Goddard broadside[edit]

   The Goddard broadside.

   In January 1777, Congress commissioned Mary Katherine Goddard to print
   a new broadside that, unlike the Dunlap broadside, listed the signers
   of the Declaration.^[23]^[24] With the publication of the Goddard
   broadside, the public learned for the first time who had signed the
   Declaration.^[24] One of the eventual signers of the Declaration,
   Thomas McKean, is not listed on the Goddard broadside, suggesting that
   he had not yet added his name to the signed document at that time.

   In 1949, nine Goddard broadsides were known to still exist. The
   reported locations of those copies at that time were:^[25]
    1. Library of Congress (Washington, D.C.)
    2. Connecticut State Library (Hartford, Connecticut)
    3. Library of the late John W. Garrett
    4. Maryland Hall of Records (Annapolis, Maryland)
    5. Maryland Historical Society (Baltimore, Maryland)
    6. Massachusetts Archives (Dorchester, Massachusetts)
    7. New York Public Library (New York, New York)
    8. Library Company of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)
    9. Rhode Island State Archives (Providence, Rhode Island)

Other broadsides[edit]

   A rare four-column broadside at Lauinger Library, Georgetown
   University.

   In addition to the broadsides authorized by Congress, many states and
   private printers also issued broadsides of the Declaration, using the
   Dunlap broadside as a source. In 1949, an article in the Harvard
   Library Review surveyed all the broadsides known to exist at that time
   and found 19 editions or variations of editions, including the Dunlap
   and Goddard printings. The author was able to locate 71 copies of these
   various editions.^[15]

   A number of copies have been discovered since that time. In 1971, a
   copy of a rare four-column broadside probably printed in Salem,
   Massachusetts was discovered in Georgetown University's Lauinger
   Library.^[26] In 2010, there were media reports that a copy of the
   Declaration was located in Shimla, India, having been discovered
   sometime during the 1990s. The type of copy was not specified.^[27]

Engrossed copy[edit]

   The copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the
   engrossed or parchment copy. This copy was probably handwritten by
   clerk Timothy Matlack, and given the title of "The unanimous
   declaration of the thirteen United States of America."^[28]

   Throughout the Revolutionary War, the engrossed copy was moved with the
   Continental Congress,^[29] which relocated several times to avoid the
   British army. In 1789, after creation of a new government under the
   United States Constitution, the engrossed Declaration was transferred
   to the custody of the secretary of state.^[29] The document was
   evacuated to Virginia when the British attacked Washington, D.C. during
   the War of 1812.^[29]
   National Bureau of Standards preserving the engrossed copy of the
   Declaration of Independence in 1951.

   After the War of 1812, the symbolic stature of the Declaration steadily
   increased even though the engrossed copy's ink was noticeably
   fading.^[16] In 1820, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams commissioned
   printer William J. Stone to create an engraving essentially identical
   to the engrossed copy.^[29] Stone's engraving was made using a wet-ink
   transfer process, where the surface of the document was moistened, and
   some of the original ink transferred to the surface of a copper plate,
   which was then etched so that copies could be run off the plate on a
   press. When Stone finished his engraving in 1823, Congress ordered 200
   copies to be printed on parchment.^[29] Because of poor conservation of
   the engrossed copy through the 19th century, Stone's engraving, rather
   than the original, has become the basis of most modern
   reproductions.^[30]

   From 1841 to 1876, the engrossed copy was publicly exhibited at the
   Patent Office building in Washington, D.C. Exposed to sunlight and
   variable temperature and humidity, the document faded badly. In 1876,
   it was sent to Independence Hall in Philadelphia for exhibit during the
   Centennial Exposition, which was held in honor of the Declaration's
   100th anniversary, and then returned to Washington the next year.^[29]
   In 1892, preparations were made for the engrossed copy to be exhibited
   at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, but the poor condition
   of the document led to the cancellation of those plans and the removal
   of the document from public exhibition.^[29] The document was sealed
   between two plates of glass and placed in storage. For nearly 30 years,
   it was exhibited only on rare occasions at the discretion of the
   Secretary of State.^[31]

   In 1921, custody of the Declaration, along with the United States
   Constitution, was transferred from the State Department to the Library
   of Congress. Funds were appropriated to preserve the documents in a
   public exhibit that opened in 1924.^[32] After the Japanese attack on
   Pearl Harbor in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the
   United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox in Kentucky, where they
   were kept until 1944.^[33]

   For many years, officials at the National Archives believed that they,
   rather than the Library of Congress, should have custody of the
   Declaration and the Constitution. The transfer finally took place in
   1952, and the documents, along with the Bill of Rights, are now on
   permanent display at the National Archives in the "Rotunda for the
   Charters of Freedom." Although encased in helium, by the early 1980s
   the documents were threatened by further deterioration. In 2001, using
   the latest in preservation technology, conservators treated the
   documents and re-encased them in encasements made of titanium and
   aluminum, filled with inert argon gas.^[34] They were put on display
   again with the opening of the remodeled National Archives Rotunda in
   2003.^[35]
