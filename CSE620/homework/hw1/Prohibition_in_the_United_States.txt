   Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide Constitutional ban on
   the sale, production, importation, and transportation of alcoholic
   beverages that remained in place from 1920 to 1933. It was promoted by
   "dry" crusaders movement, led by rural Protestants and social
   Progressives in the Democratic and Republican parties, and was
   coordinated by the Anti-Saloon League. Prohibition was mandated under
   the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Enabling
   legislation, known as the Volstead Act, set down the rules for
   enforcing the ban and defined the types of alcoholic beverages that
   were prohibited. For example, religious uses of wine were allowed.
   Private ownership and consumption of alcohol was not made illegal under
   federal law; however, in many areas local laws were more strict, with
   some states banning possession outright. Nationwide Prohibition ended
   with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the
   Eighteenth Amendment, on December 5, 1933.

   In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the introduction of
   alcohol prohibition and its subsequent enforcement in law was a
   hotly-debated issue. Prohibition supporters, called drys, presented it
   as a victory for public morals and health. Anti-prohibitionists, known
   as wets, criticized the alcohol ban as an intrusion of mainly rural
   Protestant ideals on a central aspect of urban, immigrant, and Catholic
   life. Though popular opinion believes that Prohibition failed, it
   succeeded in cutting overall alcohol consumption in half during the
   1920s, and consumption remained below pre-Prohibition levels until the
   1940s,^[1] suggesting that Prohibition did socialize a significant
   proportion of the population in temperate habits, at least temporarily.
   Some researchers contend that its political failure is attributable
   more to a changing historical context than to characteristics of the
   law itself.^[2] Criticism remains that Prohibition led to unintended
   consequences such as the growth of criminal organizations, including
   the modern American Mafia.^[citation needed]

History[edit]

   The U.S. Senate proposed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 18, 1917.
   Upon being approved by a 36th state on January 16, 1919, the amendment
   was ratified as a part of the Constitution. By the terms of the
   amendment, the country went dry one year later, on Jan. 17,
   1920.^[3]^[4]

   On November 18, 1918, prior to ratification of the Eighteenth
   Amendment, the U.S. Congress passed the temporary Wartime Prohibition
   Act, which banned the sale of alcoholic beverages having an alcohol
   content of greater than 2.75 percent.^[5] (This act, which was intended
   to save grain for the war effort, was passed after the armistice ending
   World War I was signed on November 11, 1918.) The Wartime Prohibition
   Act took effect June 30, 1919, with July 1, 1919, becoming known as the
   "Thirsty-First".^[6]^[7]

   On October 28, 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act, the popular name
   for the National Prohibition Act, over President Woodrow Wilson's veto.
   The act established the legal definition of intoxicating liquors as
   well as penalties for producing them.^[8] Although the Volstead Act
   prohibited the sale of alcohol, the federal government lacked resources
   to enforce it. By 1925, in New York City alone, there were anywhere
   from 30,000 to 100,000 speakeasy clubs.^[9]

   While Prohibition was successful in reducing the amount of liquor
   consumed, it stimulated the proliferation of rampant underground,
   organized and widespread criminal activity.^[10] Many were astonished
   and disenchanted with the rise of spectacular gangland crimes (such as
   Chicago's Saint Valentine's Day Massacre), when prohibition was
   supposed to reduce crime. Prohibition lost its advocates one by one,
   while the wet opposition talked of personal liberty, new tax revenues
   from legal beer and liquor, and the scourge of organized crime.^[11]

   On March 22, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the
   Cullen–Harrison Act, legalizing beer with an alcohol content of 3.2
   percent (by weight) and wine of a similarly low alcohol content. On
   December 5, 1933, ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed
   the Eighteenth Amendment. However, United States federal law still
   prohibits the manufacture of distilled spirits without meeting numerous
   licensing requirements that make it impractical to produce spirits for
   personal beverage use.^[12]

Origins[edit]

   The Drunkard's Progress: A lithograph by Nathaniel Currier supporting
   the temperance movement, January 1846

   Consumption of alcoholic beverages has been a contentious topic in
   America since the colonial period. In May 1657, the General Court of
   Massachusetts made the sale of strong liquor "whether known by the name
   of rumme, strong water, wine, brandy, etc." illegal.^[13]

   In general, informal social controls in the home and community helped
   maintain the expectation that the abuse of alcohol was unacceptable.
   "Drunkenness was condemned and punished, but only as an abuse of a
   God-given gift. Drink itself was not looked upon as culpable, any more
   than food deserved blame for the sin of gluttony. Excess was a personal
   indiscretion."^[14] When informal controls failed, there were legal
   options.

   Shortly after the United States obtained independence, the Whiskey
   Rebellion took place in western Pennsylvania in protest of
   government-imposed taxes on whiskey. Although the taxes were primarily
   levied to help pay down the newly formed national debt, it also
   received support from some social reformers, who hoped a "sin tax"
   would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.^[15]
   The whiskey tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's
   Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party of
   Alexander Hamilton and George Washington, came to power in 1800.^[16]

   Benjamin Rush, one of the foremost physicians of the late eighteenth
   century, believed in moderation rather than prohibition. In his
   treatise, "The Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the
   Human Body and Mind" (1784), Rush argued that the excessive use of
   alcohol was injurious to physical and psychological health, labeling
   drunkenness as a disease.^[17] Apparently influenced by Rush's widely
   discussed belief, about 200 farmers in a Connecticut community formed a
   temperance association in 1789. Similar associations were formed in
   Virginia in 1800 and New York in 1808.^[18] Within a decade, other
   temperance groups had formed in eight states, some of them being
   statewide organizations. The words of Rush and other early temperance
   reformers served to dichotomize the use of alcohol for men and women.
   While men enjoyed drinking and often considered it vital to their
   health, women who began to embrace the ideology of "true motherhood"
   refrained from consumption of alcohol. Middle-class women, who were
   considered the moral authorities of their households, consequently
   rejected the drinking of alcohol, which they believed to be a threat to
   the home.^[18] In 1830, on average, Americans consumed 1.7 bottles of
   hard liquor per week, three times the amount consumed in 2010.^[10]

   The 1898 Congressional Record, when reporting on a proposed tax on
   distilled spirits (H.R. 10253), noted that the relationship between
   populations, tax on distilled spirits (made from things other than
   fruit), and consumption was thus: (The Aggregates are grouped by tax
   rate)

Development of the prohibition movement[edit]

   Union's campaign against the producers and sellers of beers in Hawaii

   The American Temperance Society (ATS), formed in 1826, helped initiate
   the first temperance movement and served as a foundation for many later
   groups. By 1835 the ATS had reached 1.5 million members, with women
   constituting 35 to 60 percent of its chapters.^[19]

   The prohibition movement, also known as the dry crusade, continued in
   the 1840s, spearheaded by pietistic religious denominations, especially
   the Methodists. The late nineteenth century saw the temperance movement
   broaden its focus from abstinence to include all behavior and
   institutions related to alcohol consumption. Preachers such as Reverend
   Mark A. Matthews linked liquor-dispensing saloons with
   prostitution.^[citation needed]

   Some successes were achieved in the 1850s, including the Maine law,
   adopted in 1851, which banned the manufacture and sale of liquor.
   However, it was repealed in 1856. The temperance movement lost strength
   and was marginalized during the American Civil War (1861–1865).

   Following the war, the dry crusade was revived by the national
   Prohibition Party, founded in 1869, and the Woman's Christian
   Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1873. The WCTU advocated the
   prohibition of alcohol as a method for preventing abuse from alcoholic
   husbands.^[20] One of the WCTU's methods to achieve that goal was
   education. WCTU members believed that if their organization could reach
   children with its message, it could create a dry sentiment leading to
   prohibition. Frances Willard, the second president of the WCTU, held
   the aims of the organization were to create a "union of women from all
   denominations, for the purpose of educating the young, forming a better
   public sentiment, reforming the drinking classes, transforming by the
   power of Divine grace those who are enslaved by alcohol, and removing
   the dram-shop from our streets by law."^[21] While still denied
   universal voting privileges, women in the WCTU followed Frances
   Willard's "Do Everything" doctrine and used temperance as a method of
   entering into politics and furthering other progressive issues such as
   prison reform and labor laws.^[22]

   In 1881 Kansas became the first state to outlaw alcoholic beverages in
   its Constitution. Carrie Nation gained notoriety for enforcing the
   state's ban on alcohol consumption by walking into saloons, scolding
   customers, and using her hatchet to destroy bottles of liquor. Nation
   recruited ladies into the Carrie Nation Prohibition Group, which she
   also led. While Nation's vigilante techniques were rare, other
   activists enforced the dry cause by entering saloons, singing, praying,
   and urging saloonkeepers to stop selling alcohol.^[23] Other dry
   states, especially those in the South, enacted prohibition legislation,
   as did individual counties within a state.

   Court cases also debated the subject of prohibition. Although there was
   a tendency to support prohibition, some cases ruled in opposition. In
   Mugler v. Kansas (1887), Justice Harlan commented: "We cannot shut out
   of view the fact, within the knowledge of all, that the public health,
   the public morals, and the public safety, may be endangered by the
   general use of intoxicating drinks; nor the fact established by
   statistics accessible to every one, that the idleness, disorder,
   pauperism and crime existing in the country, are, in some degree...
   traceable to this evil."^[24] In support of prohibition, Crowley v.
   Christensen (1890), remarked: "The statistics of every state show a
   greater amount of crime and misery attributable to the use of ardent
   spirits obtained at these retail liquor saloons than to any other
   source."^[24]

   Proliferation of neighborhood saloons in the post-Civil War era became
   a phenomenon of an increasingly industrialized, urban workforce.
   Workingmen's bars were popular social gathering places from the
   workplace and home life. The brewing industry was actively involved in
   establishing saloons as a lucrative consumer base in their business
   chain. Saloons were more often than not linked to a specific brewery,
   where the saloonkeeper's operation was financed by a brewer and
   contractually obligated to sell the brewer's product to the exclusion
   of competing brands. A saloon's business model often included the
   concept of the free lunch, where the bill of fare commonly consisting
   of heavily-salted food meant to induce thirst and the purchase of
   drink.^[25] During the Progressive Era (1890–1920), hostility toward
   saloons and their political influence became widespread, with the
   Anti-Saloon League superseding the Prohibition Party and the Woman's
   Christian Temperance Union as the most influential advocate of
   prohibition, after these latter two groups expanded their efforts to
   support other social reform issues, such as women's suffrage, onto
   their prohibition platform.

   Prohibition was an important force in state and local politics from the
   1840s through the 1930s. The political forces involved were
   ethnoreligious in character, as demonstrated by numerous historical
   studies.^[26] Prohibition was supported by the drys, primarily
   pietistic Protestant denominations that included Methodists, Northern
   Baptists, Southern Baptists, New School Presbyterians, Disciples of
   Christ, Congregationalists, Quakers, and Scandinavian Lutherans, but
   also included the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America. These
   religious groups identified saloons as politically corrupt and drinking
   as a personal sin. Other active organizations included the Women's
   Church Federation, the Women's Temperance Crusade, and the Department
   of Scientific Temperance Instruction. They were opposed by the wets,
   primarily liturgical Protestants (Episcopalians and German Lutherans)
   and Roman Catholics, who denounced the idea that the government should
   define morality.^[27] Even in the wet stronghold of New York City there
   was an active prohibition movement, led by Norwegian church groups and
   African-American labor activists who believed that prohibition would
   benefit workers, especially African Americans. Tea merchants and soda
   fountain manufacturers generally supported prohibition, believing a ban
   on alcohol would increase sales of their products.^[28] A particularly
   effective operator on the political front was Wayne Wheeler of the
   Anti-Saloon League, who made Prohibition a wedge issue and succeeded in
   getting many pro-prohibition candidates elected. Wheeler became known
   as the "dry boss" because of his influence and power.^[29]

   Prohibition represented a conflict between urban and rural values
   emerging in the United States. Given the mass influx of migrants to the
   urban centers of the United States, many individuals within the
   prohibition movement associated the crime and morally-corrupt behavior
   of American cities with their large, immigrant populations. Saloons
   frequented by immigrants in these cities were often frequented by
   politicians who wanted to "buy" the immigrants' votes in exchange for
   favors such as job offers, legal assistance, financial help, and trade
   union memberships. Thus, saloons were seen as a breeding ground for
   political corruption.^[30] In a backlash to the emerging reality of a
   changing American demographic, many prohibitionists subscribed to the
   doctrine of nativism, in which they endorsed the notion that America
   was made great as a result of its white Anglo-Saxon ancestry. This
   belief fostered resentments towards urban immigrant communities, who
   typically argued in favor of abolishing prohibition.^[31] Additionally,
   nativist sentiments were part of a larger process of Americanization
   taking place during the same time period.^[32]

   Two other amendments to the Constitution were championed by dry
   crusaders to help their cause. One was granted in the Sixteenth
   Amendment (1913), which replaced alcohol taxes that funded the federal
   government with a federal income tax.^[33] The other was women's
   suffrage, which was granted after the passage of the Nineteenth
   Amendment in 1920; since women tended to support prohibition,
   temperance organizations tended to support women's suffrage.^[33]

   In the presidential election of 1916, the Democratic incumbent, Woodrow
   Wilson, and the Republican candidate, Charles Evans Hughes, ignored the
   prohibition issue, as did both parties' political platforms. Democrats
   and Republicans had strong wet and dry factions, and the election was
   expected to be close, with neither candidate wanting to alienate any
   part of his political base.

   In January 1917, the 65th Congress convened, in which the dries
   outnumbered the wets by 140 to 64 in the Democratic Party and 138 to 62
   among Republicans. With America's declaration of war against Germany in
   April, German Americans, a major force against prohibition, were
   sidelined and their protests subsequently ignored. In addition, a new
   justification for prohibition arose: prohibiting the production of
   alcoholic beverages would allow more resources—especially grain that
   would otherwise be used to make alcohol—to be devoted to the war
   effort. While wartime prohibition was a spark for the movement,^[34]
   World War I ended before nationwide Prohibition was enacted.

   A resolution calling for a Constitutional amendment to accomplish
   nationwide Prohibition was introduced in Congress and passed by both
   houses in December 1917. By January 16, 1919, the Amendment had been
   ratified by thirty-six of the forty-eight states needed to assure it
   passage into law. Eventually, only two of those states—Connecticut and
   Rhode Island—failed to ratify it.^[35]^[36] On October 28, 1919,
   Congress passed enabling legislation, known as the Volstead Act, to
   enforce the Eighteenth Amendment when it went into effect in 1920.

   Prohibition began on January 17, 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment
   went into effect. A total of 1,520 Federal Prohibition agents (police)
   were given the task of enforcing the law.

   Although it was highly controversial, Prohibition received support
   among diverse groups. Progressives believed Prohibition would improve
   society, as generally did women, southerners, those living in rural
   areas, and African Americans. However, a few exceptions—such as the
   Woman's Organization for Prohibition Reform—opposed it. American
   humorist Will Rogers joked about southern prohibitionists: "The South
   is dry and will vote dry. That is, everybody sober enough to stagger to
   the polls."^[citation needed] Supporters of the Amendment soon became
   confident that it would not be repealed. One of its creators, Senator
   Morris Sheppard, joked that "there is as much chance of repealing the
   Eighteenth Amendment as there is for a humming-bird to fly to the
   planet Mars with the Washington Monument tied to its tail."^[37]

   At the same time, songs emerged decrying the act. After Edward, Prince
   of Wales, returned to the United Kingdom following his tour of Canada
   in 1919, he recounted to his father, King George V, a ditty he had
   heard at a border town:

            “

                 Four and twenty Yankees, feeling very dry,
                Went across the border to get a drink of rye.
              When the rye was opened, the Yanks began to sing,
              "God bless America, but God save the King!"^[38]
                                                               ”

   Prohibition became highly controversial among medical professionals,
   because alcohol was widely prescribed by the era's physicians for
   therapeutic purposes. Congress held hearings on the medicinal value of
   beer in 1921. Subsequently, physicians across the country lobbied for
   the repeal of Prohibition as it applied to medicinal liquors.^[39]

   While the manufacture, importation, sale, and transport of alcohol was
   illegal in the United States, Section 29 of the Volstead Act allowed of
   wine and cider to be made from fruit at home, but not beer. Up to 200
   gallons of wine and cider per year could be made, and some vineyards
   grew grapes for home use. The Act did not prohibit consumption of
   alcohol. Many people stockpiled wines and liquors for their personal
   use in the latter part of 1919 before sales of alcoholic beverages
   became illegal in January 1920.

   Prohibition in the United States did not apply in neighboring
   countries, where alcoholic drinks were not illegal. Distilleries and
   breweries in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean flourished as their
   products were either consumed by visiting Americans or smuggled into
   the United States illegally. The Detroit River, which forms part of the
   U.S. border with Canada, was notoriously difficult to control,
   especially rum-running in Windsor, Canada. When the U.S. government
   complained to the British that American law was being undermined by
   officials in Nassau, Bahamas, the head of the British Colonial Office
   refused to intervene.^[40] Winston Churchill believed that Prohibition
   was "an affront to the whole history of mankind".^[41]

   During the time known as the "Roaring Twenties", Chicago became a haven
   for Prohibition dodgers. Many of Chicago's most notorious gangsters,
   including Al Capone and his enemy Bugs Moran, made millions of dollars
   through illegal alcohol sales. By the end of the decade Capone
   controlled 10,000 speakeasies in Chicago and ruled the bootlegging
   business from Canada to Florida. Numerous other crimes, including theft
   and murder, were directly linked to criminal activities in Chicago and
   elsewhere in violation of Prohibition.^[citation needed]

   Three federal agencies were assigned the task of enforcing the Volstead
   Act: the U.S. Coast Guard Office of Law Enforcement,^[42]^[43] the U.S.
   Treasury Department's IRS Bureau of Prohibition,^[44]^[45] and the U.S.
   Department of Justice Bureau of Prohibition.^[46]^[47]

Unpopularity of prohibition and repeal movement[edit]

   As early as 1925, journalist H. L. Mencken believed that Prohibition
   was not working.^[48] As the prohibition years continued, more of the
   country's populace came to see prohibition as illustrative of class
   distinctions, a law unfairly biased in its administration favoring
   social elites. "Prohibition worked best when directed at its primary
   target: the working-class poor."^[49] Historian Lizabeth Cohen writes:
   "A rich family could have a cellar-full of liquor and get by, it
   seemed, but if a poor family had one bottle of home-brew, there would
   be trouble."^[50] Working-class people were inflamed by the fact that
   their employers could dip into a cache of private stock while they, the
   employees, were denied a similar indulgence.^[51]

   Before the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect in January 1920, many
   of the upper classes stockpiled alcohol for legal home consumption
   after Prohibition began. They bought the inventories of liquor
   retailers and wholesalers, emptying out their warehouses, saloons, and
   club storerooms. American lawmakers followed these practices at the
   highest levels of government. President Woodrow Wilson moved his own
   supply of alcoholic beverages to his Washington residence after his
   term of office ended. His successor, Warren G. Harding, relocated his
   own large supply into the White House after inauguration.^[52]^[53]

   In October 1930, just two weeks before the congressional midterm
   elections, bootlegger George Cassiday—"the man in the green hat"—came
   forward and told how he had bootlegged for ten years for members of
   Congress. One of the few bootleggers ever to tell his story, Cassiday
   wrote five front-page articles for The Washington Post. He estimated
   that eighty percent of congressmen and senators drank, even though they
   were the ones passing dry laws. This had a significant impact on the
   midterm election, which saw Congress shift from a dry Republican
   majority to a wet Democratic majority, who understood that Prohibition
   was unpopular and called for its repeal.^[54] As Prohibition became
   increasingly unpopular, especially in urban areas, its repeal was
   eagerly anticipated. Economic urgency played no small part in
   accelerating the advocacy for repeal. Prior to the 1920 implementation
   of the Volstead Act, approximately fourteen percent of federal, state,
   and local tax revenues were derived from alcohol commerce. The
   government needed this income and also felt that reinstating the
   manufacture and sale of alcohol would create desperately-needed jobs
   for the unemployed.^[55]

   On March 22, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an amendment to
   the Volstead Act, known as the Cullen–Harrison Act, allowing the
   manufacture and sale of 3.2 beer (3.2 percent alcohol by weight,
   approximately 4 percent alcohol by volume) and light wines. The
   Volstead Act previously defined an intoxicating beverage as one with
   greater than 0.5 percent alcohol.^[8] Upon signing the Cullen–Harrison
   Act, Roosevelt made his famous remark: "I think this would be a good
   time for a beer."^[56] The Cullen-Harrison Act became law on April 7,
   1933, and the following day Anheuser-Busch sent a team of Clydesdale
   horses to deliver a case of Budweiser beer to the White
   House.^[citation needed]

Repeal[edit]

   The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed on December 5, 1933, with
   ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
   Despite the efforts of Heber J. Grant, president of The Church of Jesus
   Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Utah convention helped ratify the
   Twenty-first Amendment.^[57] While Utah can be considered the deciding
   thirty-sixth state to ratify the Amendment and make it law, both
   Pennsylvania and Ohio approved it the same day that Utah did.^[citation
   needed]

   One of the main reasons why Prohibition did not proceed smoothly was
   the inefficient means of enforcing it. From its inception, the
   Eighteenth Amendment lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the public who
   had previously been drinkers and law-abiding citizens. In some
   instances the public viewed Prohibition laws as "arbitrary and
   unnecessary", and therefore were willing to break them. Law enforcement
   agents found themselves overwhelmed by the rise in illegal, wide-scale
   distribution of alcohol due to the Volstead Act. The magnitude of their
   task was not anticipated and law enforcement agencies lacked the
   resources needed. Additionally, enforcement of the law under the
   Eighteenth Amendment lacked a centralized authority. Many attempts to
   impose Prohibition laws were deterred due to the lack of transparency
   between federal and state authorities. Furthermore, American geography
   contributed to the difficulties in enforcing Prohibition. The varied
   terrain of valleys, mountains, lakes, and swamps, as well as the
   extensive seaways, ports, and borders the United States shared with
   Canada and Mexico made it exceedingly difficult for Prohibition agents
   to stop bootleggers given their lack of resources. Ultimately it was
   recognized with its repeal that the means by which the law was to be
   enforced was not pragmatic, and in many cases the legislature did not
   match the general public opinion.^[58]

   Prohibition was a major blow to the alcoholic beverage industry and its
   repeal was a step toward the amelioration of one sector of the economy.
   An example of this is the case of St. Louis, one of the most important
   alcohol producers before prohibition started, who was ready to resume
   its position in the industry as soon as possible. Its major brewery had
   "50,000 barrels" of beer ready for distribution since March 22, 1933,
   and was the first alcohol producer to resupply the market; others soon
   followed. After repeal, stores obtained liquor licenses and restocked
   for business. After beer production resumed, thousands of workers found
   jobs in the industry again.^[59]

   Prohibition created a black market that competed with the formal
   economy, which already was under pressure.^[clarification needed]
   Roosevelt was elected based on the New Deal, which promised economic
   improvement that was only possible if the formal economy competed
   successfully against various economic forces, including the black
   market. This influenced his support for ratifying the Twenty-first
   amendment, which repealed the Prohibition.^[60]

Post-repeal[edit]

   by U.S. state
   Map showing dry (red), wet (blue), and mixed (yellow) counties in the
   United States. (See List of dry communities by U.S. state.)

   The Twenty-first Amendment does not prevent states from restricting or
   banning alcohol; instead, it prohibits "transportation or importation"
   of alcohol in "any State, Territory, or Possession of the United
   States" "in violation of the laws thereof", thus allowing state and
   local control of alcohol.^[61] Following repeal of Prohibition, alcohol
   could be legally sold in some, but not all, townships or counties
   within a particular state, while other states continued to enforce
   prohibition laws. Mississippi, which had made alcohol illegal in 1907,
   was the last state to repeal Prohibition in 1966.^[citation needed]
   Kansas did not allow sale of liquor "by the drink" (on-premises) until
   1987.^[citation needed] There are still numerous dry counties and
   townships in the United States that restrict or prohibit liquor
   sales.^[62]

   Additionally, many tribal governments prohibit alcohol on Indian
   reservations. Federal law also prohibits alcohol on Indian
   reservations,^[63] although this law is currently only enforced when
   there is a concomitant violation of local tribal liquor laws.^[64] The
   federal law prohibiting alcohol in Indian country pre-dates the
   Eighteenth Amendment. No constitutional changes were necessary prior to
   the passage of this amendment, since Indian reservations and U.S.
   territories have always been considered areas of direct federal
   jurisdiction.^[citation needed]

   After repeal of Prohibition, some supporters openly admitted its
   failure. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. explained his view in a letter
   written in 1932:^[65]

     When Prohibition was introduced, I hoped that it would be widely
     supported by public opinion and the day would soon come when the
     evil effects of alcohol would be recognized. I have slowly and
     reluctantly come to believe that this has not been the result.
     Instead, drinking has generally increased; the speakeasy has
     replaced the saloon; a vast army of lawbreakers has appeared; many
     of our best citizens have openly ignored Prohibition; respect for
     the law has been greatly lessened; and crime has increased to a
     level never seen before.

   It is not clear whether Prohibition reduced per-capita consumption of
   alcohol. Some historians claim that alcohol consumption in the United
   States did not exceed pre-Prohibition levels until the 1960s;^[66]
   others claim that alcohol consumption reached the pre-Prohibition
   levels several years after its enactment, and have continued to
   rise.^[67] Cirrhosis of the liver, normally a result of alcoholism,
   dropped nearly two thirds during Prohibition.^[68]^[69] In the decades
   after Prohibition, Americans shed any stigma they might have had
   against alcohol consumption. According to a Gallup Poll survey
   conducted almost every year since 1939, some two-thirds of American
   adults age 18 and older drink alcohol.^[70]

Prohibition and pietistic Protestantism[edit]

   Prohibition in the early to mid-twentieth century was fueled by the
   Protestant denominations in the United States.^[71] Pietistic churches
   in the United States sought to end drinking and the saloon culture
   during the Third Party System. Liturgical ("high") churches (Catholic,
   Episcopal, and German Lutheran) opposed prohibition laws because they
   did not want the government redefining morality to a narrow standard
   and criminalizing the common liturgical practice of using wine.^[72]

   Revivalism in Second Great Awakening and the Third Great Awakening in
   the mid- and late-nineteenth century set the stage for the bond between
   pietistic Protestantism and prohibition in the United States: "The
   greater prevalence of revival religion within a population, the greater
   support for the Prohibition parties within that population."^[73]
   Historian Nancy Koester expressed the belief that Prohibition was a
   "victory for progressives and social gospel activists battling
   poverty".^[74] Prohibition also united progressives and
   revivalists.^[75]

Effects of Prohibition[edit]

   Most economists during the early 20th century were in favor for the
   enactment of the 18th amendment.^[76] Simon Patten, one of the leading
   advocates for prohibition, predicted that American prohibition would
   eventually happen for competitive and evolutionary reasons. Economist
   Irving Fisher was a Yale professor and a dry who wrote extensively
   about prohibition during the prohibition era. In his paper "The
   Economics of Prohibition", he makes a case for the economic effects of
   prohibition.^[77] Fisher is credited with supplying the criteria for
   which future prohibitions, such as marijuana prohibition, can be
   measured. His main points were in relation to crime, health, and most
   notably productivity. For example, "Blue Monday" refers to the hangover
   workers experienced on Mondays due to the weekends being spent on
   consuming alcohol, resulting in Mondays being a wasted productive
   day.^[78]

   Making moonshine was an industry in the American South before and after
   Prohibition. In the 1950s muscle cars became popular and various roads
   became known as "Thunder Road" for their use by moonshiners. A popular
   ballad was created and the legendary drivers, cars and routes were
   depicted on film in Thunder Road.^[79]^[80]^[81]^[82]

Rates of consumption during Prohibition[edit]

   Illegal sales are not officially reported or measured, but there are
   indirect estimates using alcohol related deaths and cirrhosis, a
   disease linked specifically to ongoing alcohol consumption.^[83]
   Scholars estimate that consumption dropped to a low of about 60% of
   pre-prohibition levels around 1925, rising to almost 80% before the law
   was officially repealed.

Organized crime[edit]

   Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition. Mafia groups
   limited their activities to prostitution, gambling, and theft until
   1920, when organized bootlegging emerged in response to
   Prohibition.^[84] A profitable, often violent, black market for alcohol
   flourished. Powerful criminal organizations corrupted some law
   enforcement agencies, leading to racketeering.^[citation needed]
   Prohibition provided a financial basis for organized crime to
   flourish.^[85]

   Rather than reducing crime, Prohibition transformed some cities into
   battlegrounds between opposing bootlegging gangs.^[citation needed] In
   a study of more than thirty major U.S cities during the Prohibition
   years of 1920 and 1921, the number of crimes increased by 24 percent.
   Additionally, theft and burglaries increased by 9 percent, homicides by
   12.7 percent, assaults and battery rose by 13 percent, drug addiction
   by 44.6 percent, and police department costs rose by 11.4 percent. This
   was largely the result of "black-market violence" and the diversion of
   law enforcement resources elsewhere. Despite the Prohibition movement's
   hope that outlawing alcohol would reduce crime, the reality was that
   the Volstead Act led to higher crime rates than were experienced prior
   to Prohibition and the establishment of a black market dominated by
   criminal organizations.^[86]

   Furthermore, stronger liquor surged in popularity because its potency
   made it more profitable to smuggle. To prevent bootleggers from using
   industrial ethyl alcohol to produce illegal beverages, the federal
   government ordered the poisoning of industrial alcohols. In response,
   bootleggers hired chemists who successfully renatured the alcohol to
   make it drinkable. As a response, the Treasury Department required
   manufacturers to add more deadly poisons, including the particularly
   deadly methyl alcohol. New York City medical examiners prominently
   opposed these policies because of the danger to human life. As many as
   10,000 people died from drinking denatured alcohol before Prohibition
   ended.^[87] New York City medical examiner Charles Norris believed the
   government took responsibility for murder when they knew the poison was
   not deterring people and they continued to poison industrial alcohol
   (which would be used in drinking alcohol) anyway. Norris remarked: "The
   government knows it is not stopping drinking by putting poison in
   alcohol... [Y]et it continues its poisoning processes, heedless of the
   fact that people determined to drink are daily absorbing that poison.
   Knowing this to be true, the United States government must be charged
   with the moral responsibility for the deaths that poisoned liquor
   causes, although it cannot be held legally responsible."^[87]
   Al Capone, the Prohibition-era leader of organized crime in Chicago.

   Another lethal substance that was often substituted for alcohol was
   "canned heat", also commonly known as Sterno. Forcing the substance
   through a makeshift filter, such as a handkerchief, created a rough
   liquor substitute; however, the result was poisonous, though not often
   lethal. Many of those who were poisoned as a result united to sue the
   government for reparations after the end of Prohibition.^[88]

   Making alcohol at home was very common during Prohibition. Stores sold
   grape concentrate with warning labels that listed the steps that should
   be avoided to prevent the juice from fermenting into wine. Some
   drugstores sold "medical wine" with around a 22 percent alcohol
   content. In order to justify the sale, the wine was given a medicinal
   taste.^[88] Home-distilled hard liquor was called bathtub gin in
   northern cities, and moonshine in rural areas of Virginia, Kentucky,
   North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. Homebrewing
   good hard liquor was easier than brewing good beer.^[88] Since selling
   privately distilled alcohol was illegal and bypassed government
   taxation, law enforcement officers relentlessly pursued
   manufacturers.^[89] In response, bootleggers modified their cars and
   trucks by enhancing the engines and suspensions to make faster vehicles
   that, they presumed, would improve their chances of outrunning and
   escaping agents of the Bureau of Prohibition, commonly called "revenue
   agents" or "revenuers". These cars became known as "moonshine runners"
   or "'shine runners".^[90] Shops were also known to participate in the
   underground liquor market, by loading their stocks with ingredients for
   liquors, which anyone could legally purchase (these include:
   benedictine, vermouth, scotch mash, and even ethyl alcohol).^[91]

   Prohibition also had an effect on the music industry in the United
   States, specifically with jazz. Speakeasies became far more popular
   during that time, and the effects of the Great Depression caused a
   migration that led to a greater dispersal of jazz music. Movement began
   from New Orleans and went north through Chicago and to New York. This
   led to the development of different styles in different cities. Because
   of its popularity in speakeasies and the development of more advanced
   recording devices, jazz became very popular very quickly. It was also
   at the forefront of the minimal integration efforts going on at the
   time, as it united mostly black musicians with mostly white
   audiences.^[92]

   Along with other economic effects, the enactment and enforcement of
   Prohibition caused an increase in resource costs. During the 1920s the
   annual budget of the Bureau of Prohibition went from $4.4 million to
   $13.4 million. Additionally, the U.S. Coast Guard spent an average of
   $13 million annually on enforcement of prohibition laws.^[93] These
   numbers do not take into account the costs to local and state
   governments.

   When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, organized crime lost nearly all
   of its black market profits from alcohol in most states, because of
   competition with legal liquor stores selling alcohol at lower prices.
   (States still retained the right to enforce their own state laws
   concerning alcohol consumption.)^[citation needed]

Other impacts[edit]

   Men and women drinking beer at a bar in Raceland, Louisiana, September
   1938. Pre-Prohibition saloons were mostly male establishments;
   post-Prohibition bars catered to both males and females.

   As a result of Prohibition, the advancements of industrialization
   within the alcoholic beverage industry were essentially reversed.
   Large-scale alcohol producers were shut down, for the most part, and
   some individual citizens took it upon themselves to produce alcohol
   illegally, essentially reversing the efficiency of mass-producing and
   retailing alcoholic beverages. Closing the country's manufacturing
   plants and taverns also resulted in an economic downturn for the
   industry. While the Eighteenth Amendment did not have this effect on
   the industry due to its failure to define an "intoxicating" beverage,
   the Volstead Act's definition of 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume
   shut down the brewers, who expected to continue to produce beer of
   moderate strength.^[94]

   As the saloon began to die out, public drinking lost much of its macho
   connotation, resulting in increased social acceptance of women drinking
   in the semi-public environment of the speakeasies. This new norm
   established women as a notable new target demographic for alcohol
   marketeers, who sought to expand their clientele.^[94]

   In 1930 the Prohibition Commissioner estimated that in 1919, the year
   before the Volstead Act became law, the average drinking American spent
   $17 per year on alcoholic beverages. By 1930, because enforcement
   diminished the supply, spending had increased to $35 per year (there
   was no inflation in this period). The result was an illegal alcohol
   beverage industry that made an average of $3 billion per year in
   illegal untaxed income.^[95]

   Heavy drinkers and alcoholics were among the most affected groups
   during Prohibition. Those who were determined to find liquor could
   still do so, but those who saw their drinking habits as destructive
   typically had difficulty in finding the help they sought. Self-help
   societies had withered away along with the alcohol industry. In 1935 a
   new self-help group was founded: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).^[94]

   Prohibition had a notable effect on the alcohol brewing industry in the
   US. When Prohibition ended, only half the breweries that previously
   existed reopened.^[citation needed] Wine historians note that
   Prohibition destroyed what was a fledgling wine industry in the United
   States. Productive, wine-quality grapevines were replaced by
   lower-quality vines that grew thicker-skinned grapes, which could be
   more easily transported. Much of the institutional knowledge was also
   lost as winemakers either emigrated to other wine producing countries
   or left the business altogether.^[96] Distilled spirits became more
   popular during Prohibition.^[88] Because of its higher alcohol content
   in comparison to fermented wine and beer, it became common to mix and
   dilute the hard alcohol.^[88]

Winemaking during Prohibition[edit]

   The Volstead Act specifically allowed individual farmers to make
   certain wines "on the legal fiction that it was a non-intoxicating
   fruit-juice for home consumption",^[97] and many did so. Enterprising
   grape farmers produced liquid and semi-solid grape concentrates, often
   called "wine bricks" or "wine blocks".^[98] This demand led California
   grape growers to increase their land under cultivation by about 700
   percent during the first five years of Prohibition. The grape
   concentrate was sold with a warning: "After dissolving the brick in a
   gallon of water, do not place the liquid in a jug away in the cupboard
   for twenty days, because then it would turn into wine."^[14] One grape
   block producer sold nine varieties: Port, Virginia Dare, Muscatel,
   Angelica, Tokay, Sauternes, Riesling, Claret and Burgundy.^[citation
   needed]

   The Volstead Act allowed the sale of sacramental wine to priests and
   ministers, and allowed rabbis to approve sales of sacramental wine to
   individuals for Sabbath and holiday use at home. The Bureau of Internal
   Revenue maintained a list of ecumenical organizations that could be
   used for verifying licensure.^[citation needed] Among Jews, four
   rabbinical groups were approved, which led to some competition for
   membership, since the supervision of sacramental licenses could be used
   to secure donations to support a religious institution. There were
   known abuses in this system, with imposters or unauthorized agents
   using loopholes to purchase wine.^[33]^[99]
