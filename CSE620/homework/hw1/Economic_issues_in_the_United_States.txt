   A country's economic issues reflect the distribution of intellectual
   and material resources and workload in its society. The United States
   is one of the most affluent countries in the world, with a leading
   system of higher education, but – with the exception of a few much
   smaller Asian city states – it is also the world's industralized
   country with the most uneven distribution of wealth.

Educational system[edit]

   This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help
   improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced
   material may be challenged and removed. (October 2008)

   The U.S. educational system is compulsory for the first 9 to 12 years
   of education, depending on the state. While most students graduate
   between 17 and 18 years of age, many states allow for the student to
   voluntarily remove themselves from enrollment, or "drop out" without
   earning a diploma.^[citation needed]

   Although some funding comes from the federal government, public
   education is almost entirely funded and controlled individually by
   state and local governments and school districts. Within a state,
   primary control of the system rests with the state, which delegates
   authority to local authorities.^[1] Although the Department of
   Education wields some authority, most powers concerning schooling
   remain with the states.^[citation needed]

   The funding and condition of the school system in each municipality is
   largely determined by the school district or local government. In
   affluent communities, especially those with many school-age children,
   the educational system tends to be more heavily funded on a per-student
   basis and tends to be more effective. Communities that are less
   affluent or have a lower proportion of families with children generally
   spend less money per child.^[1] Statistical information generated by
   the No Child Left Behind Act, and similar acts at a state level,
   demonstrate the general correlation between money spent per child and
   academic success.^[citation needed]

   State governments since the 1970s have grappled with these issues of
   educational equity. Despite these attempts, in 1992, the U.S. General
   Accounting Office stated, "Although most states pursued strategies to
   supplement the local funding of poor school districts, wealthier
   districts in 37 states had more total (state and local combined)
   funding than poor districts in the 1991-92 school year. This disparity
   existed even after adjusting for differences in geographic and student
   need-related education costs." ^[2] In some states, most prominently
   New Jersey, courts have ordered dramatically increased funding in lower
   income areas. In other states, legislatures have acted on their own
   initiative to somewhat equalize the funding available.^[3]

Access to health insurance[edit]

   The United States does not have universal health care or a system of
   socialized medicine. Health insurance may be provided as an employee
   benefit, while unemployed, part-time, and self-employed workers must
   often pay for their own insurance. In 2001, 41.2 million people in the
   United States (14.6% of the US population) had no health insurance
   coverage, though a significant portion of those are in the U.S. without
   proper documentation. By 2004, this had risen to 45 million (15.6%).
   The U.S. Census Bureau attributed the drop primarily to the loss of
   employer-provided plans due to the economic downturn and a continuation
   of rising costs.

   A recent Harvard University study found that medical bills are a
   leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. The study found that
   many declaring bankruptcy were part of the middle class and were
   employed before they became ill, but had lost their health insurance by
   the time they declared bankruptcy. In the U.S., people leaving a job
   can continue with their former employer's health insurance plan under
   the COBRA at a rate that is usually double the rate the employee paid
   while employed. When an employer-insured person loses a job due to
   illness and does not have sufficient resources to continue to pay for
   COBRA health insurance, they also lose their coverage.

   Efforts to provide universal health care in the 1960s and early 1990s
   floundered against widespread opposition by politicians who objected to
   government control of medicine and business groups which opposed
   further regulation of the healthcare and insurance industries. Despite
   a general consensus, codified in the federal Emergency Medical
   Treatment and Active Labor Act, that emergency care must be provided
   even to the indigent, it is not widely accepted in the United States
   that the availability of broader health care should be considered a
   right and paid for by public funds.

Cost of living[edit]

   Some states have a cost of living wage that requires a business to add
   an additional wage to the minimum wage^[citation needed].

   The minimum wage is an extremely minor part of inflation or cost of
   living increases. In fact, the minimum wage has not kept up with
   inflation over the past 30 years^[citation needed]. Inflation has much
   more to do with monetary policy and credit^[citation needed].

Rising land values[edit]

   A rise in land values was the true bubble of the so-called housing
   bubble.^[4]^[5] Even after the crash in home prices, land values are
   high near the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and low elsewhere in the
   U.S.^[4] High land values result in high cost of living, causing cities
   and states in expensive areas to have high taxes. The high cost areas
   are at a competitive disadvantage to the rest of the country, and was a
   factor in the population shift to the South in the last several
   decades.

   The economic effects of land prices was most notably discussed by Henry
   George. This economic school of thought is known as Georgism.

Use of credit and savings rate[edit]

   The United States has the lowest savings rate of any developed nation.
   This low savings rate is offset by the high use of credit.
