Text[edit]

     In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
     speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and
     district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district
     shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of
     the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the
     witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining
     witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for
     his defence.^[1]

   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives

Rights secured[edit]

Speedy trial[edit]

   Main article: Speedy Trial Clause

   Criminal defendants have the right to a speedy trial. In Barker v.
   Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Supreme Court laid down a four-part
   case-by-case balancing test for determining whether the defendant's
   speedy trial right has been violated. The four factors are:
     * Length of delay. A delay of a year or more from the date on which
       the speedy trial right "attaches" (the date of arrest or
       indictment, whichever first occurs) was termed "presumptively
       prejudicial," but the Court has never explicitly ruled that any
       absolute time limit applies.
     * Reason for the delay. The prosecution may not excessively delay the
       trial for its own advantage, but a trial may be delayed to secure
       the presence of an absent witness or other practical considerations
       (e.g., change of venue).
     * Time and manner in which the defendant has asserted his right. If a
       defendant agrees to the delay when it works to his own benefit, he
       cannot later claim that he has been unduly delayed.
     * Degree of prejudice to the defendant which the delay has caused.

   In Strunk v. United States, 412 U.S. 434 (1973), the Supreme Court
   ruled that if the reviewing court finds that a defendant's right to a
   speedy trial was violated, then the indictment must be dismissed and/or
   the conviction overturned. The Court held that, since the delayed trial
   is the state action which violates the defendant's rights, no other
   remedy would be appropriate. Thus, a reversal or dismissal of a
   criminal case on speedy trial grounds means that no further prosecution
   for the alleged offense can take place.

Public trial[edit]

   Main article: Public trial

   In Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966), the Supreme Court ruled
   that the right to a public trial is not absolute. In cases where excess
   publicity would serve to undermine the defendant's right to due
   process, limitations can be put on public access to the proceedings.
   According to Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986),
   trials can be closed at the behest of the government if there is "an
   overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to
   preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that
   interest." The accused may also request a closure of the trial; though,
   it must be demonstrated that "first, there is a substantial probability
   that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by
   publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable
   alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant's right
   to a fair trial."

Impartial jury[edit]

   Main article: Juries in the United States

   The right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense
   with which the defendant is charged. Petty offenses—those punishable by
   imprisonment for no more than six months—are not covered by the jury
   requirement.^[2] Even where multiple petty offenses are concerned, the
   total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months, the right to
   a jury trial does not exist.^[3] Also, in the United States, except for
   serious offenses (such as murder), minors are usually tried in a
   juvenile court, which lessens the sentence allowed, but forfeits the
   right to a jury.

   Originally, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a
   jury trial indicated a right to “a trial by jury as understood and
   applied at common law, and includes all the essential elements as they
   were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was
   adopted.”^[4] Therefore, it was held that juries had to be composed of
   twelve persons and that verdicts had to be unanimous, as was customary
   in England.

   When, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court extended the
   right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts, it re-examined
   some of the standards. It has been held that twelve came to be the
   number of jurors by "historical accident," and that a jury of six would
   be sufficient,^[5] but anything less would deprive the defendant of a
   right to trial by jury.^[6] The Sixth Amendment mandates unanimity in a
   federal jury trial. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Due
   Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while requiring states to
   provide jury trials for serious crimes, does not incorporate all the
   elements of a jury trial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.
   Thus, states are not mandated to require jury unanimity, unless the
   jury has only six members.^[7]^[8]^[9]

Impartiality[edit]

   The Sixth Amendment requires juries to be impartial. Impartiality has
   been interpreted as requiring individual jurors to be unbiased. At voir
   dire, each side may question potential jurors to determine any bias,
   and challenge them if the same is found; the court determines the
   validity of these challenges for cause. Defendants may not challenge a
   conviction because a challenge for cause was denied incorrectly if they
   had the opportunity to use peremptory challenges.

Venire of juries[edit]

   Another factor in determining the impartiality of the jury is the
   nature of the panel, or venire, from which the jurors are selected.
   Venires must represent a fair cross-section of the community; the
   defendant may establish that the requirement was violated by showing
   that the allegedly excluded group is a "distinctive" one in the
   community, that the representation of such a group in venires is
   unreasonable and unfair in regard to the number of persons belonging to
   such a group, and that the under-representation is caused by a
   systematic exclusion in the selection process. Thus, in Taylor v.
   Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), the Supreme Court invalidated a state
   law that exempted women who had not made a declaration of willingness
   to serve from jury service, while not doing the same for men.

Sentencing[edit]

   In Apprendi v. New Jersey,^[10] and Blakely v. Washington,^[11] the
   Supreme Court ruled that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury
   trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but also
   regarding any fact used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the
   maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines.^[12] In
   Alleyne v. United States,^[13] the Court expanded on Apprendi and
   Blakely by ruling that a defendant's right to a jury applies to any
   fact that would increase a defendant's sentence beyond the minimum
   otherwise required by statute.^[14]

Vicinage[edit]

   Main article: Vicinage Clause

   Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution requires defendants be tried
   by juries and in the state in which the crime was committed. The Sixth
   Amendment requires the jury to be selected from judicial districts
   ascertained by statute. In Beavers v. Henkel, 194 U.S. 73 (1904), the
   Supreme Court ruled that the place where the offense is charged to have
   occurred determines a trial's location. Where multiple districts are
   alleged to have been locations of the crime, any of them may be chosen
   for the trial. In cases of offenses not committed in any state (for
   example, offenses committed at sea), the place of trial may be
   determined by the Congress.

Notice of accusation[edit]

   Main article: Notice

   A criminal defendant has the right to be informed of the nature and
   cause of the accusation against him. Therefore, an indictment must
   allege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision
   that it would allow the accused to assert double jeopardy if the same
   charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution.^[15] The Supreme
   Court held in United States v. Carll, 105 U.S. 611 (1881) that “in an
   indictment ... it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the
   words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly,
   and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the
   elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.”
   Vague wording, even if taken directly from a statute, does not suffice.
   However, the government is not required to hand over written copies of
   the indictment free of charge.^[16]

Confrontation[edit]

   Main article: Confrontation Clause

   The Confrontation Clause relates to the common law rule preventing the
   admission of hearsay, that is to say, testimony by one witness as to
   the statements and observations of another person to prove that the
   statement or observation was accurate. The rationale was that the
   defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and
   cross-examine the person making the statements. Certain exceptions to
   the hearsay rule have been permitted; for instance, admissions by the
   defendant are admissible, as are dying declarations.^[17] Nevertheless,
   in California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970), the Supreme Court has held
   that the hearsay rule is not the same as the Confrontation Clause.
   Hearsay is admissible under certain circumstances. For example, in
   Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the Supreme Court ruled
   that while a defendant's out of court statements were admissible in
   proving the defendant's guilt, they were inadmissible hearsay against
   another defendant. Hearsay may, in some circumstances, be admitted
   though it is not covered by one of the long-recognized exceptions. For
   example, prior testimony may sometimes be admitted if the witness is
   unavailable. However, in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004),
   the Supreme Court increased the scope of the Confrontation Clause by
   ruling that "testimonial" out-of-court statements are inadmissible if
   the accused did not have the opportunity to cross-examine that accuser
   and that accuser is unavailable at trial. In Davis v. Washington 547
   U.S. 813 (2006), the Court ruled that "testimonial" refers to any
   statement that an objectively reasonable person in the declarant's
   situation would believe likely to be used in court. In Melendez-Diaz v.
   Massachusetts, 557 U.S. ___ (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564
   U.S. ___ (2011), the Court ruled that admitting a lab chemist's
   analysis into evidence, without having him testify, violated the
   Confrontation Clause.^[18]^[19] In Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. ___
   (2011), the Court ruled that the "primary purpose" of a shooting
   victim's statement as to who shot him, and the police's reason for
   questioning him, each had to be objectively determined. If the "primary
   purpose" was for dealing with an "ongoing emergency", then any such
   statement was not testimonial and so the Confrontation Clause would not
   require the person making that statement to testify in order for that
   statement to be admitted into evidence.^[20]

   The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses also applies to
   physical evidence; the prosecution must present physical evidence to
   the jury, providing the defense ample opportunity to cross-examine its
   validity and meaning. Prosecution generally may not refer to evidence
   without first presenting it.

   In the late 20th and early 21st century this clause became an issue in
   the use of the silent witness rule.^[21]

Compulsory process[edit]

   Main article: Compulsory Process Clause

   The Compulsory Process Clause gives any criminal defendant the right to
   call witnesses in his favor. If any such witness refuses to testify,
   that witness may be compelled to do so by the court at the request of
   the defendant.^[22]^[23] However, in some cases the court may refuse to
   permit a defense witness to testify. For example, if a defense lawyer
   fails to notify the prosecution of the identity of a witness to gain a
   tactical advantage, that witness may be precluded from testifying.^[24]

Assistance of counsel[edit]

   Main article: Assistance of Counsel Clause

   A criminal defendant has the right to be represented by counsel.

   In Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), the Supreme Court ruled that
   “in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel,
   and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of
   ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty
   of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him.” In
   Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938), the Supreme Court ruled that in
   all federal cases, counsel would have to be appointed for defendants
   who were too poor to hire their own. However, in Betts v. Brady, 316
   U.S. 455 (1942), the Court declined to extend this requirement to the
   state courts under the Fourteenth Amendment unless the defendant
   demonstrated "special circumstances" requiring the assistance of
   counsel.

   In 1961, the Court extended the rule that applied in federal courts to
   state courts. It held in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52 (1961), that
   counsel had to be provided at no expense to defendants in capital cases
   when they so requested, even if there was no "ignorance, feeble
   mindedness, illiteracy, or the like." Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S.
   335 (1963), explicitly overruled Betts v. Brady and found that counsel
   must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases. Under
   Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972), counsel must be appointed in
   any case resulting in a sentence of actual imprisonment. Regarding
   sentences not immediately leading to imprisonment, the Court in Scott
   v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979), ruled that counsel did not need to be
   appointed, but in Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002), the Court
   held that a suspended sentence that may result in incarceration can not
   be imposed if the defendant did not have counsel at trial.

   As stated in Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977), the right to
   counsel “[means] at least that a person is entitled to the help of a
   lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been
   initiated against him, whether by formal charge, preliminary hearing,
   indictment, information, or arraignment.”^[25] Brewer goes on to
   conclude that once adversary proceeding have begun against a defendant,
   he has a right to legal representation when the government interrogates
   him^[26] and that when a defendant is arrested, “arraigned on [an
   arrest] warrant before a judge,” and “committed by the court to
   confinement,” “[t]here can be no doubt that judicial proceedings ha[ve]
   been initiated.”

Self-representation[edit]

   Main article: Pro se legal representation in the United States

   A criminal defendant may represent himself, unless a court deems the
   defendant to be incompetent to waive the right to counsel.

   In Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), the Supreme Court
   recognized a defendant's right to pro se representation. However, under
   Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389 (1993), a court can require a defendant
   to be represented by counsel if it believes the accused less than fully
   competent to adequately proceed without counsel. In Martinez v. Court
   of Appeal of California, 528 U.S. 152 (2000), the Supreme Court ruled
   the right to pro se representation did not apply to appellate courts.
   In Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008), the Court ruled that a
   criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial,
   but not competent to represent himself.

   In Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), the Supreme Court held that
   the constitutional right of "meaningful access to the courts" can be
   satisfied by counsel or access to legal materials. Bounds has been
   interpreted by several United States courts of appeals to mean a pro se
   defendant does not have a constitutional right to access a prison law
   library to research his defense when access to the courts has been
   provided through appointed counsel.^[27]
