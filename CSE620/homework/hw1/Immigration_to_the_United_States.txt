   Immigration to the United States is a complex demographic phenomenon
   that has been a major source of population growth and cultural change
   throughout much of the history of the United States. The economic,
   social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy
   regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants,
   settlement patterns, impact on upward social mobility, crime, and
   voting behavior. On a per capita basis, the United States lets in fewer
   immigrants than half the countries in the OECD.^[1] Prior to 1965,
   policies such as the national origins formula limited immigration and
   naturalization opportunities for people from areas outside Western
   Europe.

   The civil rights movement of the 1960s led to the replacement^[2] of
   these ethnic quotas with per-country limits.^[3] Since then, the number
   of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has
   quadrupled,^[4] from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in
   2007.^[5] Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the United States from
   2000 to 2010.,^[6] and over one million persons were naturalized as
   U.S. citizens in 2008. Since the per-country limit^[3] applies the same
   maximum on the number of visas to all countries regardless of their
   population, it has had the effect of severely restricting the legal
   immigration of persons born in Mexico, India, China, and the
   Philippines – currently the leading^[7] countries of origin of
   immigrants to the United States.^[8]

   Family reunification accounts for approximately two-thirds of legal
   immigration to the US every year.^[9] As of 2009^[update], 66% of legal
   immigrants were admitted on this basis, along with 13% admitted for
   their employment skills and 17% for humanitarian reasons.^[10]

   Migration is difficult, expensive, and dangerous for those who enter
   the US illegally across the Mexico–United States border.^[11] Virtually
   all undocumented immigrants have no avenues for legal entry to the
   United States due the restrictive legal limits on green cards, and lack
   of immigrant visas for low skilled workers.^[8] Participants in debates
   on immigration in the early twenty-first century called for increasing
   enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the
   United States, building a barrier along some or all of the 2,000-mile
   (3,200 km) U.S.-Mexico border, or creating a new guest worker program.
   Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate
   about these proposals. As of April 2010^[update] few of these proposals
   had become law, though a partial border fence had been approved and
   subsequently canceled.^[12]

History

   Main article: History of immigration to the United States

   American immigration history can be viewed in four epochs: the colonial
   period, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century, and
   post-1965. Each period brought distinct national groups, races and
   ethnicities to the United States. During the 17th century,
   approximately 400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America.^[13]
   Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the
   17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants.^[14] The
   mid-19th century saw mainly an influx from northern Europe; the early
   20th-century mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe; post-1965 mostly
   from Latin America and Asia.
   Immigrants arriving at Ellis Island, 1902

   Historians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants came to the
   United States from Europe between 1600 and 1799.^[15] The 1790 Act
   limited naturalization to "free white persons"; it was expanded to
   include blacks in the 1860s and Asians in the 1950s.^[16] In the early
   years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people a
   year,^[17] including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti.
   After 1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1836 to 1914, over 30
   million Europeans migrated to the United States.^[18] The death rate on
   these transatlantic voyages was high, during which one in seven
   travelers died.^[19] In 1875, the nation passed its first immigration
   law, the Page Act of 1875.^[20]

   The peak year of European immigration was in 1907, when 1,285,349
   persons entered the country.^[21] By 1910, 13.5 million immigrants were
   living in the United States.^[22] In 1921, the Congress passed the
   Emergency Quota Act, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The 1924
   Act was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern
   Europeans, especially Jews, Italians, and Slavs, who had begun to enter
   the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s.^[23] Most of the
   European refugees fleeing the Nazis and World War II were barred from
   coming to the United States.^[24]
   Polish immigrants working on the farm, 1909. The welfare system was
   practically non-existent before the 1930s and the economic pressures on
   the poor were giving rise to child labor.

   Immigration patterns of the 1930s were dominated by the Great
   Depression, which hit the U.S. hard and lasted over ten years there. In
   the final prosperous year, 1929, there were 279,678 immigrants
   recorded,^[25] but in 1933, only 23,068 came to the U.S.^[15] In the
   early 1930s, more people emigrated from the United States than to
   it.^[26] The U.S. government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program
   which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico,
   but thousands were deported against their will.^[27] Altogether about
   400,000 Mexicans were repatriated.^[28] In the post-war era, the
   Justice Department launched Operation Wetback, under which 1,075,168
   Mexicans were deported in 1954.^[29]

     First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants
     annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration
     remains substantially the same.... Secondly, the ethnic mix of this
     country will not be upset.... Contrary to the charges in some
     quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from
     any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations
     of Africa and Asia.... In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of
     immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as
     sharply as the critics seem to think.

     — Ted Kennedy, chief Senate sponsor of the Immigration and
     Nationality Act of 1965.^[30]

   The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, also known as the
   Hart-Cellar Act, abolished the system of national-origin quotas. By
   equalizing immigration policies, the act resulted in new immigration
   from non-European nations, which changed the ethnic make-up of the
   United States.^[31] In 1970, 60% of immigrants were from Europe; this
   decreased to 15% by 2000.^[32] In 1990, George H. W. Bush signed the
   Immigration Act of 1990,^[33] which increased legal immigration to the
   United States by 40%.^[34] Appointed by Bill Clinton,^[35] the U.S.
   Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration
   from about 800,000 people per year to approximately 550,000.^[36] While
   an influx of new residents from different cultures presents some
   challenges, "the United States has always been energized by its
   immigrant populations," said President Bill Clinton in 1998. "America
   has constantly drawn strength and spirit from wave after wave of
   immigrants [...] They have proved to be the most restless, the most
   adventurous, the most innovative, the most industrious of people."^[37]

   Nearly 8 million people immigrated to the United States from 2000 to
   2005; 3.7 million of them entered without papers.^[38]^[39] Since 1986
   Congress has passed seven amnesties for undocumented immigrants.^[40]
   In 1986 president Ronald Reagan signed immigration reform that gave
   amnesty to 3 million undocumented immigrants in the country.^[41]
   Hispanic immigrants suffered job losses during the late-2000s
   recession,^[42] but since the recession's end in June 2009, immigrants
   posted a net gain of 656,000 jobs.^[43] Over 1 million immigrants were
   granted legal residence in 2011.^[44]

Contemporary immigration

   Until the 1930s most legal immigrants were male. By the 1990s women
   accounted for just over half of all legal immigrants.^[47] Contemporary
   immigrants tend to be younger than the native population of the United
   States, with people between the ages of 15 and 34 substantially
   overrepresented.^[48] Immigrants are also more likely to be married and
   less likely to be divorced than native-born Americans of the same
   age.^[49]

   Paterson, New Jersey, within the New York City Metropolitan Area, is
   becoming an increasingly popular destination for Muslim immigrants.

   Immigrants are likely to move to and live in areas populated by people
   with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true throughout the
   history of immigration to the United States.^[50] Seven out of ten
   immigrants surveyed by Public Agenda in 2009 said they intended to make
   the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they could do it over
   again they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of
   immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing
   immigration laws since the September 11, 2001 attacks ("9/11"), and 24%
   report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of
   discrimination.^[51]

   Public attitudes about immigration in the U.S. were heavily influenced
   in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. After the attacks, 52% of
   Americans believed that immigration was a good thing overall for the
   U.S., down from 62% the year before, according to a 2009 Gallup
   poll.^[52] A 2008 Public Agenda survey found that half of Americans
   said tighter controls on immigration would do "a great deal" to enhance
   U.S. national security.^[53] Harvard political scientist and historian
   Samuel P. Huntington argued in Who Are We? The Challenges to America's
   National Identity that a potential future consequence of continuing
   massive immigration from Latin America, especially Mexico, might lead
   to the bifurcation of the United States.

   The population of illegal Mexican immigrants in the US fell from
   approximately 7 million in 2007 to 6.1 million in 2011^[54]
   Commentators link the reversal of the immigration trend to the economic
   downturn that started in 2008 and which meant fewer available jobs, and
   to the introduction of tough immigration laws in many
   states.^[55]^[56]^[57]^[58] According to the Pew Hispanic Center the
   total number of Mexican born persons had stagnated in 2010, and tended
   toward going into negative figures.^[59]

   Detroit, Jersey City, Minneapolis, Miami, Denver, Baltimore, Seattle,

   vary locally.^[61]

New reasons for immigrating to the US

   Froma Harrop, of the Providence Journal, has written about
   "environmental immigration," specifically wealthier Chinese nationals
   moving to or buying real estate in the US to escape China's heavy
   industrial pollution.^[62]

Demography

   Little Italy in New York, ca.1900

   The United States admitted more legal immigrants from 1991 to 2000,
   between ten to eleven million, than in any previous decade. In the most
   recent decade, the ten million legal immigrants that settled in the
   U.S. represent an annual growth of only about 0.3% as the U.S.
   population grew from 249 million to 281 million. By comparison, the
   highest previous decade was the 1900s, when 8.8 million people arrived,
   increasing the total U.S. population by one percent every year.
   Specifically, "nearly 15% of Americans were foreign-born in 1910, while
   in 1999, only about 10% were foreign-born."^[63]

   By 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7 percent of the US population and
   rising to 6.2 percent in 1980, with an estimated 12.5 percent in
   2009.^[64] As of 2010^[update], 25% of US residents under age 18 were
   first- or second-generation immigrants.^[65] Eight percent of all
   babies born in the U.S. in 2008 belonged to illegal immigrant parents,
   according to a recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew
   Hispanic Center.^[66]

   Legal immigration to the U.S. increased from 250,000 in the 1930s, to
   2.5 million in the 1950s, to 4.5 million in the 1970s, and to 7.3
   million in the 1980s, before resting at about 10 million in the
   1990s.^[67] Since 2000, legal immigrants to the United States number
   approximately 1,000,000 per year, of whom about 600,000 are Change of
   Status who already are in the U.S. Legal immigrants to the United
   States now are at their highest level ever, at just over 37,000,000
   legal immigrants. Illegal immigration may be as high as 1,500,000 per
   year with a net of at least 700,000 illegal immigrants arriving every
   year.^[68]^[69] Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born
   population from 1990 to 2000.^[70]
   Crowd at the Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City

   While immigration has increased drastically over the last century, the
   foreign born share of the population was still higher in 1900 (about
   20%) than it is today (about 10%). A number of factors may be
   attributed to the decrease in the representation of foreign born
   residents in the United States. Most significant has been the change in
   the composition of immigrants; prior to 1890, 82% of immigrants came
   from North and Western Europe. From 1891 to 1920, that number dropped
   to 25%, with a rise in immigrants from East, Central, and South Europe,
   summing up to 64%. Animosity towards these different and foreign
   immigrants rose in the United States, resulting in much legislation to
   limit immigration.

   Contemporary immigrants settle predominantly in seven states,
   California, New York, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
   Illinois, comprising about 44% of the U.S. population as a whole. The
   combined total immigrant population of these seven states was 70% of
   the total foreign-born population in 2000. If current birth rate and
   immigration rates were to remain unchanged for another 70 to 80 years,
   the U.S. population would double to nearly 600 million.^[71]

   The top twelve emigrant countries in 2006 were Mexico (173,753),
   People's Republic of China (87,345), Philippines (74,607), India
   (61,369), Cuba (45,614), Colombia (43,151), Dominican Republic
   (38,069), El Salvador (31,783), Vietnam (30,695), Jamaica (24,976),
   South Korea (24,386), and Guatemala (24,146). Other countries comprise
   an additional 606,370.^[72]

   In 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were an
   estimated 500,000 Hispanics.^[73] The Census Bureau projects that by
   2050, one-quarter of the population will be of Hispanic descent.^[74]
   This demographic shift is largely fueled by immigration from Latin
   America.^[75]^[76]

Demographics

   A U.S. naturalization ceremony at the Kennedy Space Center, 2010.

   The Census Bureau estimates the US population will grow from 281
   million in 2000 to 397 million in 2050 with immigration, but only to
   328 million with no immigration.^[79] A new report from the Pew
   Research Center projects that by 2050, non-Hispanic whites will account
   for 47% of the population, down from the 2005 figure of 67%.^[80]
   Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.^[81] It also
   foresees the Hispanic population rising from 14% in 2005 to 29% by
   2050.^[82] The Asian population is expected to more than triple by
   2050. Overall, the Pew Report predicts the population of the United
   States will rise from 296 million in 2005 to 438 million in 2050, with
   82% of the increase from immigrants.^[83]

   In 35 of the country's 50 largest cities, non-Hispanic whites were at
   the last census or are predicted to be in the minority.^[84] In
   California, non-Hispanic whites slipped from 80% of the state's
   population in 1970 to 42.3% in 2001^[85] and 39% in 2013.^[86]

   Immigrant segregation declined in the first half of the 20th century,
   but has been rising over the past few decades. This has caused
   questioning of the correctness of describing the United States as a
   melting pot. One explanation is that groups with lower socioeconomic
   status concentrate in more densely populated area that have access to
   public transit while groups with higher socioeconomic status move to
   suburban areas. Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more
   culturally and linguistically different from earlier groups and prefer
   to live together due to factors such as communication costs.^[87]
   Another explanation for increased segregation is white flight.^[88]

Economic

   Mexican immigrants march for more rights in Northern California's
   largest city, San Jose (2006).

   In a late 1980s study, economists overwhelmingly viewed immigration,
   including illegal immigration, as a positive for the economy.^[89]
   According to James Smith, a senior economist at Santa Monica-based RAND
   Corporation and lead author of the United States National Research
   Council's study "The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal
   Effects of Immigration", immigrants contribute as much as $10 billion
   to the U.S. economy each year.^[90] The NRC report found that although
   immigrants, especially those from Latin America, caused a net loss in
   terms of taxes paid versus social services received, immigration can
   provide an overall gain to the domestic economy due to an increase in
   pay for higher-skilled workers, lower prices for goods and services
   produced by immigrant labor, and more efficiency and lower wages for
   some owners of capital. The report also notes that although immigrant
   workers compete with domestic workers for low-skilled jobs, some
   immigrants specialize in activities that otherwise would not exist in
   an area, and thus can be beneficial for all domestic residents.^[91] A
   non-partisan report in 2007 from the Congressional Budget Office
   concluded that most estimates show that illegal immigrants impose a net
   cost to state and local governments, but “that no agreement exists as
   to the size of, or even the best way of measuring, the cost on a
   national level.”^[92] Estimates of the net national cost that illegal
   immigrants impose on the United States vary greatly, with the Urban
   Institute saying it was $1.9 billion in 1992, and a Rice University
   professor putting it at $19.3 billion in 1993.^[93] About twenty-one
   million immigrants, or about fifteen percent of the labor force, hold
   jobs in the United States; however, the number of unemployed is only
   seven million, meaning that immigrant workers are not taking jobs from
   domestic workers, but rather are doing jobs that would not have existed
   had the immigrant workers not been in the United States.^[94] U.S.
   Census Bureau's Survey of Business Owners: Hispanic-Owned Firms: 2002
   indicated that the number of Hispanic-owned businesses in the United
   States grew to nearly 1.6 million in 2002. Those businesses generated
   about $222 billion in gross revenue.^[95] The report notes that the
   burden of poor immigrants is not borne equally among states, and is
   most heavy in California.^[96] Another claim supporting expanding
   immigration levels is that immigrants mostly do jobs Americans do not
   want. A 2006 Pew Hispanic Center report added evidence to support this
   claim, when they found that increasing immigration levels have not hurt
   employment prospects for American workers.^[97] Research shows an
   economic consensus that, taken as a whole, immigrants raise living
   standards for American workers by boosting demand and increasing
   productivity, contributing to innovation, and lowering prices.^[98]
   Garment factories in Manhattan's Chinatown. Most garments are now made
   in China, not locally.^[99]

   In 2009, a study by the Cato Institute, a free market think tank, found
   that legalization of low-skilled illegal resident workers in the US
   would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten
   years.^[100] The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per
   capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of
   progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of
   federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax
   percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in
   government services than they pay in, which also reflects on
   immigrants.^[101] In any event, the typical immigrant and his children
   will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in
   government services according to the NAS.^[102] Legal immigration
   policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after
   an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in
   taxes. In 2010, an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found that
   immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people
   were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly
   boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods, but
   that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated
   into American culture.^[103]

   The Kauffman Foundation’s index of entrepreneurial activity is nearly
   40% higher for immigrants than for natives.^[104] Immigrants were
   involved in the founding of many prominent American high-tech
   companies, such as Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Sun Microsystems, and
   eBay.^[105] On the poor end of the spectrum, the "New Americans" report
   found that low-wage immigration does not, on aggregate, lower the wages
   of most domestic workers. The report also addresses the question of if
   immigration affects black Americans differently from the population in
   general: "While some have suspected that blacks suffer
   disproportionately from the inflow of low-skilled immigrants, none of
   the available evidence suggests that they have been particularly
   hard-hit on a national level. Some have lost their jobs, especially in
   places where immigrants are concentrated. But the majority of blacks
   live elsewhere, and their economic fortunes are tied to other
   factors."^[106]
   Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie led the enormous expansion of the
   American steel industry in the late 19th century.

   A study done in 2005 showed that a third of adult immigrants had not
   finished high school, and a third had no health insurance.^[38] Robert
   Samuelson points out that poor immigrants strain public services such
   as local schools and health care. He points out that "from 2000 to
   2006, 41 percent of the increase in people without health insurance
   occurred among Hispanics."^[107] According to the immigration reduction
   advocacy group Center for Immigration Studies, 25.8% of Mexican
   immigrants live in poverty, which is more than double the rate for
   natives in 1999.^[108] In another report, The Heritage Foundation notes
   that from 1990 to 2006, the number of poor Hispanics increased by 3.2
   million, from 6 million to 9.2 million.^[109]
   Bangladeshi immigrant Fazlur Rahman Khan was responsible for the
   engineering design of Sears Tower (now Willis Tower),^[110]^[111] the
   tallest building in the world until 1998.^[112]

   U.S. citizens will not take certain jobs usually done by foreign
   workers, like manual labor involving agriculture.^[113] Fruit picking
   labor costs are estimated at $0.36 per pound, so a production rate of 1
   pound per minute is required to earn minimum wage after fees are
   deducted.^[114] Hard physical labor and dangerous jobs with a small
   paycheck create labor shortages in certain job markets that can only be
   satisfied using foreign labor.^[115] Foreign laborers often work for no
   pay for several months each year to earn enough to pay their employer
   for the cost of their H series visa.^[116] Hispanic immigrants in the
   United States were hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis. There was
   a disproportionate level of foreclosures in some immigrant
   neighborhoods.^[117] The banking industry provided home loans to
   undocumented immigrants, viewing it as an untapped resource for growing
   their own revenue stream.^[118] In October 2008, KFYI reported that
   according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, five
   million illegal immigrants held fraudulent home mortgages.^[119] The
   story was later pulled from their website and replaced with a
   correction.^[120] The Phoenix Business Journal cited a HUD spokesman
   saying that there was no basis to news reports that more than five
   million bad mortgages were held by illegal immigrants, and that the
   agency had no data showing the number of illegal immigrants holding
   foreclosed or bad mortgages.^[121]

   Immigration and foreign labor documentation fees increased over 80% in
   2007, with over 90% of funding for USCIS derived from immigration
   application fees, creating many USCIS jobs involving immigration to US,
   such as immigration interview officials, finger print processor,
   Department of Homeland Security, etc.^[122] An article by American
   Enterprise Institute researcher Jason Richwine states that while
   earlier European immigrants were often poor when they arrived, by the
   third generation they had economically assimilated to be
   indistinguishable from the general population. However, for the
   Hispanic immigrants the process stalls at the second generation and the
   third generation continues to be substantially poorer than
   whites.^[123] Despite apparent disparities between different
   communities,^[124] Asians, a significant number of whom arrived in the
   United States after 1965,^[125] had the highest median income per
   household among all race groups as of 2008.^[126]

   According to NPR in 2005, about 3% of illegal immigrants were working
   in agriculture.^[127] The H-2A visa allows U.S. employers to bring
   foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural
   jobs.^[128] The passing of tough immigration laws in several states
   from around 2009 provides a number of practical case studies. The state
   of Georgia passed immigration law HB 87 in 2011;^[129] this led,
   according to the coalition of top Kansas businesses, to 50% of its
   agricultural produce being left to rot in the fields, at a cost to the
   state of more than $400m. Overall losses caused by the act were $1bn;
   it was estimated that the figure would become over $20bn if all the
   estimated 325,000 undocumented workers left Georgia. The cost to
   Alabama of its crackdown in June 2011 has been estimated at almost
   $11bn, with up to 80,000 unauthorised immigrant workers leaving the
   state.^[130]

   While immigration from Latin America has kept the United States from
   falling off a Japanese or European style demographic cliff, this is a
   limited resource as fertility rates continue to decline throughout the
   Americas and the world.^[131]

Social

   Irish immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the nativist Know Nothing
   movement, originating in New York in 1843. It was engendered by popular
   fears that the country was being overwhelmed by Irish Catholic
   immigrants. In 1891, a lynch mob stormed a local jail and hanged
   several Italians following the acquittal of several Sicilian immigrants
   alleged to be involved in the murder of New Orleans police chief David
   Hennessy. The Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed
   by the Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed
   at limiting immigration overall, and making sure that the nationalities
   of new arrivals matched the overall national profile.

   After the September 11 attacks, many Americans entertained doubts and
   suspicions about people apparently of Middle-Eastern origins.^[citation
   needed] NPR in 2010 fired a prominent black commentator, Juan Williams,
   when he talked publicly about his fears on seeing people dressed like
   Muslims on airplanes.^[132]

   Racist thinking among and between minority groups does
   occur;^[133]^[134] examples of this are conflicts between blacks and
   Korean immigrants,^[135] notably in the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, and
   between African Americans and non-white Latino immigrants.^[136]^[137]
   There has been a long running racial tension between African American
   and Mexican prison gangs, as well as significant riots in California
   prisons where they have targeted each other, for ethnic
   reasons.^[138]^[139] There have been reports of racially motivated
   attacks against African Americans who have moved into neighborhoods
   occupied mostly by people of Mexican origin, and vice
   versa.^[140]^[141] There has also been an increase in violence between
   non-Hispanic Anglo Americans and Latino immigrants, and between African
   immigrants and African Americans.^[142]

   A 2007 study on assimilation found that Mexican immigrants are less
   fluent in English than both non-Mexican Hispanic immigrants and other
   immigrants. While English fluency increases with time stayed in the
   United States, although further improvements after the first decade are
   limited, Mexicans never catch up with non-Mexican Hispanics, who never
   catch up with non-Hispanics. The study also writes that "Even among
   immigrants who came to the United States before they were ﬁve years old
   and whose entire schooling was in the United States, those Mexican born
   have average education levels of 11.7 years, whereas those from other
   countries have average levels of education of 14.1 years." Unlike other
   immigrants, Mexicans have a tendency to live in communities with many
   other Mexicans which decreases incentives for assimilation. Correcting
   for this removes about half the fluency difference between Mexicans and
   other immigrants.^[143]

Religious diversity

   Immigration from South Asia and elsewhere has contributed to enlarging
   the religious composition of the United States. Islam in the United
   States is growing mainly due to immigration. Hinduism in the United
   States, Buddhism in the United States, and Sikhism in the United States
   are other examples.^[144]

   Since 1992, an estimated 1.7 million Muslims, approximately 1 million
   Hindus, and approximately 1 million Buddhists have immigrated legally
   to the United States.^[145]

   A Boston Globe article attributed Barack Obama’s win in the 2008 U.S.
   Presidential election to a marked reduction over the preceding decades
   in the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing
   this demographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965.^[31] The
   article quoted Simon Rosenberg, president and founder of the New
   Democrat Network, as having said that the Act is "the most important
   piece of legislation that no one’s ever heard of," and that it "set
   America on a very different demographic course than the previous 300
   years."^[31]

   Immigrants differ on their political views; however, the Democratic
   Party is considered to be in a far stronger position among immigrants
   overall.^[146]^[147] Research shows that religious affiliation can also
   significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of
   immigrants, as well as the broader American population. Hispanic
   evangelicals, for example, are more strongly conservative than
   non-Hispanic evangelicals.^[148] This trend is often similar for
   Hispanics or others strongly identifying with the Catholic Church, a
   religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage.

   The key interests groups that lobby on immigration are religious,
   ethnic and business groups, together with some liberals and some
   conservative public policy organizations. Both the pro- and anti-
   groups affect policy.^[149]^[dead link]

   Studies have suggested that some special interest group lobby for less
   immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups
   since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor
   competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but
   beneficial when affecting other groups.^[citation needed]

   A 2007 paper found that both pro- and anti-immigration special interest
   groups play a role in migration policy. "Barriers to migration are
   lower in sectors in which business lobbies incur larger lobbying
   expenditures and higher in sectors where labor unions are more
   important."^[150] A 2011 study examining the voting of US
   representatives on migration policy suggests that "that representatives
   from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support
   an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite
   is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant
   districts."^[151]

   After the 2010 election, Gary Segura of Latino Decisions stated that
   Hispanic voters influenced the outcome and "may have saved the Senate
   for Democrats".^[152] Several ethnic lobbies support immigration
   reforms that would allow illegal immigrants that have succeeded in
   entering to gain citizenship. They may also lobby for special
   arrangements for their own group. The Chairman for the Irish Lobby for
   Immigration Reform has stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any
   special arrangement it can get — 'as will every other ethnic group in
   the country.'"^[153]^[154] The irrendentist and ethnic separatist
   movements for Reconquista and Aztlán see immigration from Mexico as
   strengthening their cause.^[155]^[156]

   The book Ethnic Lobbies and US Foreign Policy (2009) states that
   several ethnic special interest groups are involved in pro-immigration
   lobbying. Ethnic lobbies also influence foreign policy. The authors
   write that "Increasingly, ethnic tensions surface in electoral races,
   with House, Senate, and gubernatorial contests serving as proxy
   battlegrounds for antagonistic ethnoracial groups and communities. In
   addition, ethnic politics affect party politics as well, as groups
   compete for relative political power within a party". However, the
   authors argue that currently ethnic interest groups, in general, do not
   have too much power in foreign policy and can balance other special
   interest groups.^[157]

   In a 2012 news story, Reuters reported, "Strong support from Hispanics,
   the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, helped tip
   President Barack Obama's fortunes as he secured a second term in the
   White House, according to Election Day polling."^[158]

   Lately, there is talk among several Republican leaders, such as
   governors Bobby Jindal and Susana Martinez, of taking a new, friendlier
   approach to immigration. Former US Secretary of Commerce Carlos
   Gutierrez is promoting the creation of Republicans for Immigration
   Reform.^[159]^[160]

Health

   The issue of the health of immigrants and the associated cost to the
   public has been largely discussed. The non-emergency use of emergency
   rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay, yet some studies
   allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care by
   immigrants.^[161] For this and other reasons, there have been various
   disputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public
   health system.^[162] University of Maryland economist and Cato
   Institute scholar Julian Lincoln Simon concluded in 1995 that while
   immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take out,
   this is not the case for elderly immigrants and refugees, who are more
   dependent on public services for survival.^[163]

   Immigration from areas of high incidences of disease is thought to have
   fueled the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB), chagas, and hepatitis in
   areas of low incidence.^[164] According to Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention (CDC), TB cases among foreign-born individuals remain
   disproportionately high, at nearly nine times the rate of U.S.-born
   persons.^[165]^[166] To reduce the risk of diseases in low-incidence
   areas, the main countermeasure has been the screening of immigrants on
   arrival.^[167] HIV/AIDS entered the United States in around 1969,
   likely through a single infected immigrant from Haiti.^[168]^[169]
   Conversely, many new HIV infections in Mexico can be traced back to the
   United States.^[170] People infected with HIV were banned from entering
   the United States in 1987 by executive order, but the 1993 statute
   supporting the ban was lifted in 2009. The executive branch is expected
   to administratively remove HIV from the list of infectious diseases
   barring immigration, but immigrants generally would need to show that
   they would not be a burden on public welfare.^[171] Researchers have
   also found what is known as the "healthy immigrant effect", in which
   immigrants in general tend to be healthier than individuals born in the
   U.S.^[172]^[173]

Crime

   Empirical studies on links between immigration and crime are mixed.

   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2001, 4% of Hispanic
   males in their twenties and thirties were in prison or jail, compared
   to 1.8% of non-Hispanic white males. Hispanic men are almost four times
   as likely to go to prison at some point in their lives than
   non-Hispanic white males, although less likely than non-Hispanic
   African American males.^[174]

   Other writers have suggested that immigrants are under-represented in
   criminal statistics.^[clarification needed] In his 1999 book Crime and
   Immigrant Youth, sociologist Tony Waters argued that immigrants
   themselves are less likely to be arrested and incarcerated; he also
   argued, however, that the children of some immigrant groups are more
   likely to be arrested and incarcerated. This is a by-product of the
   strains that emerge between immigrant parents living in poor, inner
   city neighborhoods. This occurs particularly in immigrant groups with
   many children as they begin to form particularly strong peer
   sub-cultures.[12] A 1999 paper by John Hagan and Alberto Palloni
   estimated that the involvement in crime by Hispanic immigrants is less
   than that of other citizens.^[175] A 2006 Op-Ed in The New York Times
   by Harvard University Professor in Sociology Robert J. Sampson says
   that immigration of Hispanics may in fact be associated with decreased
   crime.^[176]

   A 2006 article by Migration Policy Institute cited data from the 2000
   US Census as evidence for that foreign-born men had lower incarceration
   rates than native-born men.^[177]

   According to a 2007 report by the Immigration Policy Center, the
   American Immigration Law Foundation, citing data from the 2000 US
   Census, native-born American men between 18–39 are five times more
   likely to be incarcerated than immigrants in the same
   demographic.^[178]

   A 2008 study by the Public Policy Institute of California, found that,
   "...on average, between 2000 and 2005, cities that had a higher share
   of recent immigrants (those arriving between 2000 and 2005) saw their
   crime rates fall further than cities with a lower share" but adds, "As
   with most studies, we do not have ideal data. This lack of data
   restricts the questions we will be able to answer. In particular, we
   cannot focus on the undocumented population explicitly".^[179] In a
   study released by the same Institute, immigrants were ten times less
   likely to be incarcerated than native born Americans.^[180]
   Locator map of countries and states with substantial presence of the
   criminal gang Mara Salvatrucha – darkness indicates strength.

   Explanations for the lower incarceration rates of immigrants include:
     * Legal immigrants are screened for criminality prior to entry.
     * Legal and illegal immigrants who commit serious crimes are being
       deported and therefore are unable to commit more crimes (unlike
       their US couterparts who remain in the US). They are unlikely to
       become "career criminals" moving in and out of the prison system.
       In the last 10 years, 816,000 criminal aliens have been removed
       from the United States. This does not include immigrants whose only
       offense was living or working illegally in the United States.^[181]
     * Immigrants understand the severe consequences of being arrested
       given their legal status (i.e. threat of deportation).

   Heather MacDonald at the Manhattan Institute in a 2004 article argued
   that sanctuary policies has caused large problems with crime by illegal
   aliens since the police cannot report them for deportation before a
   felony or a series of misdemeanors takes place. In Los Angeles, 95
   percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide are for illegal
   aliens. Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants (17,000) are
   for illegal aliens. 60 percent of the 20,000-strong 18th Street Gang in
   southern California were illegal aliens in a 1995 report.^[182]

   The Center for Immigration Studies in a 2009 report argued that "New
   government data indicate that immigrants have high rates of
   criminality, while older academic research found low rates. The overall
   picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good
   data and contrary information." It also criticized the reports by the
   Public Policy Institute of California and Immigration Policy Center for
   using data from the 2000 Census according to which 4% of prisoners were
   immigrants. Non-citizens often have a strong incentive to deny this in
   order to prevent deportation and there are also other problems. Better
   methods have found 20–22% immigrants. It also criticized studies
   looking at percentages of immigrants in a city and crime for only
   looking at overall crime and not immigrant crime. A 2009 analysis by
   the Department of Homeland Security found that crime rates were higher
   in metropolitan areas that received large numbers of legal immigrants,
   contradicting several older cross-city comparisons.^[181]

Environment

   Some commentators have suggested that increased immigration has a
   negative effect on the environment, especially as the level of economic
   development of the United States (and by extension, its energy,
   water^[183] and other needs that underpin its prosperity) means that
   the impact of a larger population is greater than what would be
   experienced in other countries.^[184]

   Perceived heavy immigration, especially in the southwest, has led to
   some fears about population pressures on the water supply in some
   areas. California continues to grow by more than a half-million a year
   and is expected to reach 48 million in 2030.^[185] According to the
   California Department of Water Resources, if more supplies are not
   found by 2020, residents will face a water shortfall nearly as great as
   the amount consumed today.^[186] Los Angeles is a coastal desert able
   to support at most one million people on its own water.^[187]
   California is considering using desalination to solve this
   problem.^[188]

Education

   Scientific laboratories and startup internet opportunities have been a
   powerful American magnet. By 2000, 23% of scientists with a PhD in the
   U.S. were immigrants, including 40% of those in engineering and
   computers.^[189] Roughly a third of the United State's college and
   universities graduate students in STEM fields are foreign nationals –
   in some states it is well over half of their graduate students. On Ash
   Wednesday, March 5, 2014, the presidents of 28 Catholic and Jesuit
   colleges and universities, joined the "Fast for Families" movement.
   ^[190] The "Fast for Families" movement reignited the immigration
   debate in the fall of 2013 when the movement's leaders, supported by
   many members of Congress and the President, fasted for twenty-two days
   on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. ^[191]

   A study on public schools in California found that white enrollment
   declined in response to increases in the number of Spanish-speaking
   Limited English Proficient and Hispanic students. This white flight was
   greater for schools with relatively larger proportions of
   Spanish-speaking Limited English Proficient.^[88]

   Among 25 to 44-year-olds, 55% of Hispanic immigrants that arrived after
   age 13 had not completed high school.^[192]

Effects on African Americans

   An econometic study by George J. Borjas suggested that immigration had
   detrimental effects on African-American employment in terms of lower
   wages and numbers employed. It reported that a 10% increase in the
   supply of workers reduced the black wage of that group by 2.5%^[why?],
   lowered the employment rate by 5.9% and increased the Black
   incarceration rate by 1.3%^[how?].^[193]

   Harvard University economist George J. Borjas explains that the
   controversy centers around the "huge redistribution [of wealth] away
   from [unskilled U.S. Citizen] workers to [American employers] who use
   illegal immigrants."^[38]

Public opinion

   The ambivalent feeling of Americans toward immigrants is shown by a
   positive attitude toward groups that have been visible for a century or
   more, and much more negative attitude toward recent arrivals. For
   example a 1982 national poll by the Roper Center at the University of
   Connecticut showed respondents a card listing a number of groups and
   asked, "Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and
   have gotten from this country, for each one tell me whether you think,
   on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for this country," which
   produced the results shown in the table. "By high margins, Americans
   are telling pollsters it was a very good thing that Poles, Italians,
   and Jews emigrated to America. Once again, it's the newcomers who are
   viewed with suspicion. This time, it's the Mexicans, the Filipinos, and
   the people from the Caribbean who make Americans nervous."^[194]^[195]

   In a 2002 study, which took place soon after the September 11 attacks,
   55% of Americans favored decreasing legal immigration, 27% favored
   keeping it at the same level, and 15% favored increasing it.^[196]

   In 2006, the immigration-reduction advocacy think tank the Center for
   Immigration Studies released a poll that found that 68% of Americans
   think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are
   too low. They also found that 70% said they are less likely to vote for
   candidates that favor increasing legal immigration.^[197] In 2004, 55%
   of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current
   level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased.^[198] The less
   contact a native-born American has with immigrants, the more likely one
   would have a negative view of immigrants.^[198]

   One of the most important factors regarding public opinion about
   immigration is the level of unemployment; anti-immigrant sentiment is
   where unemployment is highest, and vice-versa.^[199]

   Surveys indicate that the U.S. public consistently makes a sharp
   distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and generally views
   those perceived as “playing by the rules” with more sympathy than
   immigrants that have entered the country illegally.^[200]

Legal issues

Laws concerning immigration and naturalization

   See also: Illegal immigration to the United States
   See also: Guest Worker Program
   A U.S. green card, a document confirming permanent resident status for
   eligible immigrants, including refugees, political asylum seekers,
   family-sponsored migrants, employment-based workers and diversity
   immigrants (DV).

   Laws concerning immigration and naturalization include:
     * the 1990 Immigration Act (IMMACT), which limits the annual number
       of immigrants to 700,000. It emphasizes that family reunification
       is the main immigration criterion, in addition to
       employment-related immigration.
     * the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA)
     * the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
       (IIRIRA)

   AEDPA and IIRARA exemplify many categories of criminal activity for
   which immigrants, including green card holders, can be deported and
   have imposed mandatory detention for certain types of cases.

Asylum for refugees

   Main article: Asylum in the United States
   The U.S. offered to resettle 60,000 Bhutanese refugees of ethnic
   Nepalese descent.^[201]

   In contrast to economic migrants, who generally do not gain legal
   admission, refugees, as defined by international law, can gain legal
   status through a process of seeking and receiving asylum, either by
   being designated a refugee while abroad, or by physically entering the
   United States and requesting asylum status thereafter. A specified
   number of legally defined refugees, who either apply for asylum
   overseas or after arriving in the U.S., are admitted
   annually.^[quantify] Refugees compose about one-tenth of the total
   annual immigration to the United States, though some large refugee
   populations are very prominent.^[citation needed] In the years 2005
   through 2007, the number of asylum seekers accepted into the U.S. was
   about 40,000 per year. This compared with about 30,000 per year in the
   UK and 25,000 in Canada.^[citation needed] Japan accepted just 41
   refugees for resettlement in 2007.^[202]

   Since 1975, more than 1.3 million refugees from Asia have been
   resettled in the United States.^[203] Since 2000 the main
   refugee-sending regions have been Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, and
   Ethiopia.^[204] The ceiling for refugee resettlement for fiscal year
   2008 was 80,000 refugees.^[205] The United States expected to admit a
   minimum of 17,000 Iraqi refugees during fiscal year 2009.^[206] The
   U.S. has resettled more than 42,000 Bhutanese refugees from Nepal since
   2008.^[207]

   In fiscal year 2008, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)
   appropriated over $655 million for long-term services provided to
   refugees after their arrival in the US.^[208] The Obama administration
   has kept to about the same level.^[209]

Miscellaneous documented immigration

   In removal proceedings in front of an immigration judge, cancellation
   of removal is a form of relief that is available for certain long-time
   residents of the United States.^[210] It allows a person being faced
   with the threat of removal to obtain permanent residence if that person
   has been physically present in the U.S. for at least ten years, has had
   good moral character during that period, has not been convicted of
   certain crimes, and can show that removal would result in exceptional
   and extremely unusual hardship to his or her U.S. citizen or permanent
   resident spouse, children, or parent. This form of relief is only
   available when a person is served with a Notice to Appear to appear in
   the proceedings in the court.^[211]^[212]

   Members of Congress may submit private bills granting residency to
   specific named individuals. A special committee^[which?] vets the
   requests, which require extensive documentation. The Central
   Intelligence Agency has the statutory authority to admit up to one
   hundred people a year outside of normal immigration procedures, and to
   provide for their settlement and support. The program is called
   "PL110", named after the legislation that created the agency, Public
   Law 110, the Central Intelligence Agency Act.

Illegal immigration

   Main article: Illegal immigration to the United States
   See also: 2006 U.S. immigration reform protests and H.R. 4437

   The Illegal immigrant population of the United States is estimated to
   be between 7 and 20 million.^[213] The majority of the illegal
   immigrants are from Mexico.^[214]

   In a 2011 news story, Los Angeles Times reported, "The annual report,
   relied upon by both sides in the contentious immigration debate, found
   11.2 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., statistically
   identical to the 11.1 million estimated in 2009. ... The report also
   found that illegal immigrants in 2010 were parents of 5.5 million
   children, 4.5 million of whom were born in the U.S. and are citizens.
   Because illegal immigrants are younger and more likely to be married,
   they represented a disproportionate share of births — 8% of the babies
   born in the U.S. between March 2009 and March 2010 were to at least one
   illegal immigrant parent."^[215]

   In June 2012, President Obama issued a memorandum instructing officers
   of the federal government to defer deporting young illegal immigrants
   who had been brought to the U.S. as children. Obama's new
   non-deportation policy allows 1.7 million illegal immigrants to apply
   for the temporary right to live and work in the United States.^[216]
   The memorandum is the move by the Obama administration to use its
   executive powers to revise immigration procedures without changing the
   law.^[217] Beginning March 4, 2013, illegal immigrants who can show
   that time apart from a U.S. spouse, child or parent would create
   “extreme hardship” can apply for legal visas without leaving the
   U.S.^[218]

   On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant
   without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive
   power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.^[219] Obama said "If,
   in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in
   Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's
   part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to
   try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws.
   And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our
   democratic processes to achieve the same
   goal."^[220]^[221]^[222]^[223]^[224]

Immigration in popular culture

   1888 cartoon in Puck attacks businessmen for welcoming large numbers of
   low paid immigrants, leaving the American workingman unemployed.^[225]

   The history of immigration to the United States is the history of the
   country itself, and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found
   in American folklore, appearing over and over again in everything from
   The Godfather to Gangs of New York to "The Song of Myself" to Neil
   Diamond's "America" to the animated feature An American Tail.^[226]

   From the 1880s to the 1910s, vaudeville dominated the popular image of
   immigrants, with very popular caricature portrayals of ethnic groups.
   The specific features of these caricatures became widely accepted as
   accurate portrayals.^[227]

   In The Melting Pot (1908), playwright Israel Zangwill (1864–1926)
   explored issues that dominated Progressive Era debates about
   immigration policies. Zangwill's theme of the positive benefits of the
   American melting pot resonated widely in popular culture and literary
   and academic circles in the 20th century; his cultural symbolism – in
   which he situated immigration issues – likewise informed American
   cultural imagining of immigrants for decades, as exemplified by
   Hollywood films.^[228]^[229] The popular culture's image of ethnic
   celebrities often includes stereotypes about immigrant groups. For
   example, Frank Sinatra's public image as a superstar contained
   important elements of the American Dream while simultaneously
   incorporating stereotypes about Italian Americans that were based in
   nativist and Progressive responses to immigration.^[230]

   The process of assimilation was often a theme of popular culture. For
   example, "lace-curtain Irish" referred to middle-class Irish Americans
   desiring assimilation into mainstream society in counterpoint to an
   older, more raffish "shanty Irish". The occasional malapropisms and
   left-footed social blunders of these upward mobiles were gleefully
   lampooned in vaudeville, popular song, and the comic strips of the day
   such as "Bringing Up Father", starring Maggie and Jiggs, which ran in
   daily newspapers for 87 years (1913 to 2000).^[231]^[232] In recent
   years the popular culture has paid special attention to Mexican
   immigration^[233] and the 2004 motion picture Spanglish tells of a
   friendship of a Mexican housemaid (Paz Vega) and her boss played by
   Adam Sandler.

Immigration in literature

   Maggie and Jiggs from Bringing Up Father (January 7, 1940).

   Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in
   their immigrant lives through their writings.^[234]

   Regarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels
   and short stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly
   and Sarah Orne Jewett that emphasize emancipation from Old World
   controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant
   experience.^[235]

   On the other hand Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th
   century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new
   world of the United States.^[236]

   Jewish American writer Anzia Yezierska wrote her novel Bread Givers
   (1925) to explore such themes as Russian-Jewish immigration in the
   early 20th century, the tension between Old and New World Yiddish
   culture, and women's experience of immigration. A well established
   author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the ghetto
   and enter middle- and upper-class America. In the novel, the heroine,
   Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's "down-town ghetto" by
   breaking tradition. She quits her job at the family store and soon
   becomes engaged to a rich real-estate magnate. She graduates college
   and takes a high-prestige job teaching public school. Finally Sara
   restores her broken links to family and religion.^[237]

   The Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg in the mid-20th century wrote a
   series of four novels describing one Swedish family's migration from
   Småland to Minnesota in the late 19th century, a destiny shared by
   almost one million people. The author emphasizes the authenticity of
   the experiences as depicted (although he did change names).^[238] These
   novels have been translated into English (The Emigrants, 1951, Unto a
   Good Land, 1954, The Settlers, 1961, The Last Letter Home, 1961). The
   musical Kristina från Duvemåla by ex-ABBA members Björn Ulvaeus and
   Benny Andersson is based on this story.^[239]^[240]

   The Immigrant is a musical by Steven Alper, Sarah Knapp, and Mark
   Harelik. The show is based on the story of Harelik's grandparents,
   Matleh and Haskell Harelik, who traveled to Galveston, Texas in
   1909.^[241]

Documentary films

   File:Immigrant to America.ogv Play media
   Film about historical immigration to America from ca. 1970

   In their documentary How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories,
   filmmakers Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini examine the American
   political system through the lens of immigration reform from 2001 to
   2007. Since the debut of the first five films, the series has become an
   important resource for advocates, policy-makers and educators.^[242]

   That film series premiered nearly a decade after the filmmakers'
   landmark documentary film Well-Founded Fear which provided a
   behind-the-scenes look at the process for seeking asylum in the United
   States. That film still marks the only time that a film-crew was privy
   to the private proceedings at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
   Service (INS), where individual asylum officers ponder the often
   life-or-death fate of immigrants seeking asylum.

Legal perspectives

   University of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has
   identified three approaches the United States has taken to the legal
   status of immigrants in his book Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story
   of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States. The first,
   dominant in the 19th century, treated immigrants as in transition; in
   other words, as prospective citizens. As soon as people declared their
   intention to become citizens, they received multiple low-cost benefits,
   including the eligibility for free homesteads in the Homestead Act of
   1869, and in many states, the right to vote. The goal was to make the
   country more attractive, so large numbers of farmers and skilled
   craftsmen would settle new lands. By the 1880s, a second approach took
   over, treating newcomers as "immigrants by contract". An implicit deal
   existed where immigrants who were literate and could earn their own
   living were permitted in restricted numbers. Once in the United States,
   they would have limited legal rights, but were not allowed to vote
   until they became citizens, and would not be eligible for the New Deal
   government benefits available in the 1930s. The third and more recent
   policy^[when?] is "immigration by affiliation", which Motomura argues
   is the treatment which depends on how deeply rooted people have become
   in the country. An immigrant who applies for citizenship as soon as
   permitted, has a long history of working in the United States, and has
   significant family ties, is more deeply affiliated and can expect
   better treatment.^[243]

   It has been suggested that the US should adopt policies similar to
   those in Canada and Australia and select for desired qualities such as
   education and work experience. Another suggestion is to reduce legal
   immigration because of being a relative, except for nuclear family
   members, since such immigrations of extended relatives, who in turn
   bring in their own extended relatives, may cause a perpetual cycle of
   "chain immigration".^[123]

Interpretive perspectives

   The Statue of Liberty was a common sight to many immigrants who entered
   the United States through Ellis Island

   The American Dream is the belief that through hard work and
   determination, any United States immigrant can achieve a better life,
   usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom
   of choice.^[244] According to historians, the rapid economic and
   industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a
   resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that
   anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was
   willing to work hard.^[245] This dream has been a major factor in
   attracting immigrants to the United States.^[246]
