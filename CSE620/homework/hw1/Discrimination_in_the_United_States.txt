   Discrimination, according to Merriam Webster’s dictionary, is the
   process by which two stimuli differing in some aspect are responded to
   differently.^[1] This term is used to highlight the difference of
   treatment between members of different groups when one group is
   intentionally singled out and treated worse, or not given the same
   opportunities. As attitudes towards minorities started to change the
   term discrimination came to be used to talk about the issue. Over the
   years many forms of discrimination have come to be recognized including
   racial, gender, and sexual orientation.

History[edit]

Racial discrimination[edit]

   Picture showing that most public places were segregated.

   In the 1800s the slaves were freed by President Abraham Lincoln. After
   this starting in about the 1870s Jim Crow laws were introduced. These
   laws promoted the idea "separate but equal", meaning that the races
   although having to be in different areas and not allowed to intermingle
   were equal. The mixing of races was illegal in most places public
   schools, public transportation and eating establishments.^[2] These
   laws increased discrimination, while the idea was separate but equal
   the black schools were not as advanced and didn’t have good supplies.
   Overall the areas where African Americans were designated to do daily
   activities were always of poorer quality than that of their white
   counterparts. Discrimination was blatantly done; one example of this is
   in the case of Rosa Parks. In her area of the country it was customary
   to move to the back of the bus or give up your seat for a white person.
   Laws like these existed all over America. The court case Brown v. Board
   of Education of Topeka made people realize that there was no such thing
   as separate but equal. By separating races and saying that it was wrong
   for them to interact showed that they thought something was wrong with
   one of the races. The Supreme Court of the United States decided that
   "separate but equal" was no longer necessary in 1954. Racial
   discrimination was not only used by adults but children as well thought
   that races should not interact with one another. An example of this is
   the experiences Ruby Bridges had when she was one of the first black
   children to be "integrated" into an all-white school.

Fighting back[edit]

   During this hard time where race became a problem performing even minor
   daily tasks several people took it upon themselves to fix the system
   that was holding them down. Figures such as Martin Luther King Jr.,
   Malcolm X, and Rosa Parks^[3] are just a few to fight back against the
   race based discrimination of their era. Rosa Parks took a minor stand
   it seemed like at the time. She decided not to get up and move to the
   back of the bus when a white person asked her for her seat. This one
   incident sparked a huge movement called the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
   This one act against discrimination eventually leads to the laws on
   discrimination buses to be changed. Martin Luther King Jr., a peaceful
   activist lead many protests such as these, proving to the white society
   that was discriminating against them that they were a valuable part of
   society as well. King organized many protests that not only blacks but
   whites also attended. Eventually as was seen with the Brown v. Board of
   Education of Topeka the courts decided that it was a time to end racial
   discrimination. While King^[4] organized peaceful protests Malcolm X
   went a different route. He and his main supporters The Nation of Islam
   wanted nothing to do with white people. They can be considered examples
   of reverse discrimination in this case because they discriminated
   against whites, the same way whites discriminated against blacks. Even
   though Malcolm X’s actions were radical he is still considered one of
   the pioneers in fighting back against racial discrimination. Ruby
   Bridges is an example of a child who dealt with discrimination. She
   dealt with parents as well as students constantly verbally abusing her.
   Most parents took their child out of the class because they didn't want
   their children near her. But rather than switching back to her old
   school she persevered and stayed. Eventually the parents sent their
   children back, accepting the fact that she wasn't leaving. Ruby Bridges
   showed that people will not accept inequality and they will actively
   fight back against discrimination no matter what age.^[5]

Today[edit]

Gender discrimination[edit]

   Gender discrimination is another form of discrimination. Despite the
   Women’s rights movement women are still held back in the work place. An
   example of this is the glass ceiling^[6] this is where women and often
   minorities are held down in the work place never advancing past a
   certain point. Women are often seen as an expense to their employers
   because they take days off for children, need time off for maternity
   leave and are stereotyped as "more emotional". The theory that goes
   hand in hand with this is known as the Glass Escalator^[7] while women
   are being held down in male dominated professions, men often rise
   quickly to positions of authority in fields with mostly women
   professionals. Men are pushed forward into management even surpassing
   women who have been at the job longer and with more experience in the
   field. Not only in work settings but we see examples of this in our
   government as well. There has never been a female president and many
   did not vote for her because she seemed too cold, but when she did show
   emotion people thought she wouldn’t be able to handle the job. Double
   standards are consistently applied so that women are held down by
   discrimination.

   Men's rights deals with discrimination against men in the areas of
   family law such as divorce and child custody, labor such as paternity
   leave, paternity fraud, health, education, conscription, and other
   areas of the law such as domestic violence and allegations of rape.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation[edit]

   Main article: Homophobia

   Another type of discrimination is against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
   Transgender individuals. For personal reasons such as religious
   reasons, employers sometimes choose to not hire these people. LGBT
   people have been attacked and protested against numerous. For example,
   one topic of controversy related to LGBT people is marriage, while some
   states say it’s okay others have laws against it. There has been a rise
   in violence^[8] against LGBT people as well.

Discrimination against immigrants[edit]

   TheMeltingpot1.jpg

   People who migrate to this country are affected by a totally separate
   type of discrimination. Some people feel as though the large amounts of
   people being allowed into the country are cause for alarm, therefore
   discriminate against them. Looking for someone to blame for an increase
   in violence immigrants are constantly targeted as bringing crime to the
   United States.^[9] Arizona recently passed a law that forces people to
   carry documents with them at all times to prove their citizenship. This
   is only one controversy over immigrants in the United States, another
   is the claim that immigrants are stealing "true Americans" jobs.
   Violent hate crimes have increased^[10] drastically. Recent social
   psychological research suggests that this form of prejudice against
   migrants may be partly explained by some fairly basic cognitive
   processes.^[11]^[12]
