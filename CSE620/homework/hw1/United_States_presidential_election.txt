   The election of the President and the Vice President of the United
   States is an indirect vote in which citizens cast ballots for a slate
   of members of the U.S. Electoral College; these electors in turn
   directly elect the President and Vice President. Presidential elections
   occur quadrennially (the count beginning with the year 1792) on
   Election Day, the Tuesday between November 2 and 8,^[1] coinciding with
   the general elections of various other federal, states and local races.
   The most recent was the 2012 election, held on November 6. The next
   election will be the 2016 election, which will be held on November 8,
   2016.

   The process is regulated by a combination of both federal and state
   laws. Each state is allocated a number of Electoral College electors
   equal to the number of its Senators and Representatives in the U.S.
   Congress.^[2] Additionally, Washington, D.C. is given a number of
   electors equal to the number held by the smallest state.^[3] U.S.
   territories are not represented in the Electoral College.

   Under the U.S. Constitution, each state legislature is allowed to
   designate a way of choosing electors.^[2] Thus, the popular vote on
   Election Day is conducted by the various states and not directly by the
   federal government. Once chosen, the electors can vote for anyone, but
   – with rare exceptions like an unpledged elector or faithless elector –
   they vote for their designated candidates and their votes are certified
   by Congress, who is the final judge of electors, in early January.

   The nomination process, including the primary elections and the
   nominating conventions, was never specified in the Constitution, and
   was instead developed by the states and the political parties. This too
   is also an indirect election process, where voters cast ballots for a
   slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who
   then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee.

History[edit]

   Article Two of the United States Constitution originally established
   the method of presidential elections, including the Electoral College.
   This was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers
   who wanted the Congress to choose the president, and those who
   preferred a national popular vote.^[4]

   Each state is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size
   of its delegation in both houses of Congress combined. With the
   ratification of the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution in 1969, the
   District of Columbia is also granted a number of electors, equal to the
   number of those held by the least populous state. However, U.S.
   territories are not represented in the Electoral College.

   Constitutionally, the manner for choosing electors is determined within
   each state by its legislature. During the first presidential election
   in 1789, only 6 of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of
   popular vote.^[5] Gradually throughout the years, the states began
   conducting popular elections to help choose their slate of electors,
   resulting in the overall, nationwide indirect election system that it
   is today.

   Under the original system established by Article Two, electors could
   cast two votes to two different candidates for president. The candidate
   with the highest number of votes (provided it was a majority of the
   electoral votes) became the president, and the second-place candidate
   became the vice president. This presented a problem during the
   presidential election of 1800 when Aaron Burr received the same number
   of electoral votes as Thomas Jefferson and challenged Jefferson's
   election to the office. In the end, Jefferson was chosen as the
   president because of Alexander Hamilton's influence in the House of
   Representatives. This added to the deep rivalry between Burr and
   Hamilton which resulted in their famous 1804 duel.

   In response to the 1800 election, the 12th Amendment was passed,
   requiring electors to cast two distinct votes: one for President and
   another for Vice President. The Amendment also established rules when
   no candidate wins a majority vote in the Electoral College.

   In the presidential election of 1824, Andrew Jackson received a
   plurality, but not a majority, of electoral votes cast. The election
   was thrown to the House of Representatives, and John Quincy Adams was
   elected to the presidency. A deep rivalry was fermented between Andrew
   Jackson and House Speaker Henry Clay, who had also been a candidate in
   the election.

   Although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the
   winner of a presidential election, it does strongly correlate with who
   is the victor. In 52 of the 56 total elections held so far (about 93
   percent), the winner of the Electoral College vote has also carried the
   national popular vote. However, candidates can fail to get the most
   votes in the nationwide popular vote in a Presidential election and
   still win that election. In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular
   vote, but no one received the majority of electoral votes. According to
   the 12th Amendment in the Constitution, the House of Representatives
   must choose the president out of the top 3 people in the election. Clay
   had come fourth, so he threw his support to Adams, who then won.
   Because Adams later named Clay his Secretary of State, Jackson's
   supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal
   with Clay. Charges of a "corrupt bargain" followed Adams through his
   term. Then in 1876, 1888 and 2000, the winner of electoral vote lost
   the popular vote outright. Numerous constitutional amendments have been
   submitted seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct
   popular vote, but none has ever successfully passed both Houses of
   Congress. Another alternate proposal is the National Popular Vote
   Interstate Compact, an interstate compact whereby individual
   participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the
   winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective
   statewide results.

   The presidential election day was established on a Tuesday in the month
   of November because of the factors involved (weather, harvests and
   worship). When voters used to travel to the polls by horse, Tuesday was
   an ideal day because it allowed people to worship on Sunday, ride to
   their county seat on Monday, and vote on Tuesday–all before market day,
   Wednesday. The month of November also fit nicely between harvest time
   and harsh winter weather, which could be especially bad to people
   traveling by horse and buggy.^[6]

   Until 1937, presidents were not sworn in until March 4 because it took
   so long to count and report ballots, and because of the winner's
   logistical issues of moving to the capital. With better technology and
   the 20th Amendment being passed, presidential inaugurations were moved
   to noon on January 20–allowing presidents to start their duties
   sooner.^[6]

Procedure[edit]

Nominating process[edit]

   are traditionally the first major electoral event of presidential
   primaries and caucuses.

   Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

   The modern nominating process of U.S. presidential elections currently
   consists of two major parts: a series of presidential primary elections
   and caucuses held in each state, and the presidential nominating
   conventions held by each political party. This process was never
   included in the United States Constitution, and thus evolved over time
   by the political parties to clear the field of candidates.

   The primary elections are run by state and local governments, while the
   caucuses are organized directly by the political parties. Some states
   hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a
   combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered between
   January and June before the federal election, with Iowa and New
   Hampshire traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and
   primary, respectively.

   Like the general election, presidential caucuses or primaries are
   indirect elections. The major political parties officially vote for
   their presidential candidate at their respective nominating
   conventions, usually all held in the summer before the federal
   election. Depending on each state's law and state's political party
   rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential
   caucus or primary, they may be voting to award delegates "bound" to
   vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions, or
   they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not
   bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national
   convention.

   Unlike the general election, voters in the U.S. territories can also
   elect delegates to the national conventions.

   Along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses, state
   delegations to both the Democratic and Republican conventions also
   include "unpledged" delegates who can vote for whomever they want. For
   Republicans, these include top party officials. Democrats have a more
   expansive group of unpledged delegates called "superdelegates", who are
   party leaders and elected officials.

   Each party's presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential
   nominee to run with them on the same ticket, and this choice is
   rubber-stamped by the convention.

The popular vote on Election Day[edit]

   Election Day

   Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors
   for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature.
   Although each state currently designates electors by popular vote,
   other methods are allowed. For instance, a number of states formerly
   chose presidential electors by a vote of the state legislature itself.

   However, federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on
   the same day, which is "the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
   November," i.e. a Tuesday no earlier than November 2 and no later than
   November 8.^[7] Today, the states and the District of Columbia each
   conduct their own popular elections on Election Day to help determine
   their respective slate of electors. Thus, the presidential election is
   really an amalgamation of separate and simultaneous state elections
   instead of a single national election run by the federal government.

   Like any other election in the United States, the eligibility of an
   individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at
   state level. The Constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on
   grounds of race or color, sex or age for citizens eighteen years or
   older. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of
   state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility.

   Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select
   the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote "for
   the electors of a candidate" meaning that the voter is not voting for
   the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a
   specific Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate.

   Many voting ballots allow a voter to “blanket vote” for all candidates
   in a particular political party or to select individual candidates on a
   line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting
   ticket is determined through a legal process known as ballot access.
   Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of
   the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the
   presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not
   list every candidate running for President, but only those who have
   secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party
   warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other
   candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided that enough voters have
   endorsed the candidate, usually through a signature list.

   The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written
   in at the time of election as a write-in candidate. This is used for
   candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed
   on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste
   for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for
   president such as Mickey Mouse or comedian Stephen Colbert (whose
   application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In
   any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President
   of the United States.

   Because U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College,
   U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for
   President. Guam has held straw polls for president since the 1980
   election to draw attention to this fact.^[8]

Electoral college[edit]

   Main article: Electoral College (United States)
   Electoral College map showing the results of the 2012 U.S. presidential
   election. Incumbent Democratic president Barack Obama won the popular
   vote in 26 states and Washington, D.C. (denoted in blue) to capture 332
   electoral votes. Republican challenger Mitt Romney won the popular vote
   in 24 states (denoted in red) to capture 206 electoral votes.

   Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket
   that wins a plurality of votes wins all of that state's allocated
   electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in
   the Electoral College. Maine and Nebraska do not use this method,
   opting instead to give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and
   one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.

   Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective
   state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in
   December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for
   President and Vice President. Although Electoral College members can
   technically vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 24 states have
   laws to punish faithless electors,^[9] those who do not cast their
   electoral votes for the person whom they have pledged to elect.

   In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by
   the sitting Vice President, acting in his capacity as President of the
   Senate, and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress,
   which was elected at the same time as the President.

   If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (currently at
   least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the
   12th Amendment. Specifically, the selection of President would then be
   decided by a ballot of the House of Representatives. For the purposes
   of electing the President, each state has only one vote. A ballot of
   the Senate is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each
   senator has one vote. The House of Representatives has chosen the
   victor of the presidential race only twice, in 1800 and 1824; the
   Senate has chosen the victor of the vice-presidential race only once,
   in 1836.

   If the President is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the Vice
   President-elect acts as President. If neither are chosen by then,
   Congress by law determines who shall act as President, pursuant to the
   20th Amendment.

   Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies,
   the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a
   formality since the winner can be determined based on the
   state-by-state popular vote results. Between the general election and
   Inauguration Day, this apparent winner is referred to as the
   "President-elect" (unless it is a sitting President that has won
   re-election).

Election calendar[edit]

   The entire presidential campaign and election process usually takes
   almost two years. The typical periods of this process are as follows:
     * Spring of the previous calendar year – Candidates announce their
       intentions to run
     * Summer to December of the previous calendar year – Primary and
       caucus debates
     * January to June – Primaries and caucuses
     * July to early September – Nominating conventions (including those
       of the minor third parties)
     * Late September and October – Presidential election debates
     * Early November – Election Day
     * December – Electors cast their electoral votes
     * Early January of the following calendar year – Congress counts the
       electoral votes
     * January 20 of the following calendar year – Inauguration Day

Trends[edit]

Political experience[edit]

   A number of trends in the political experience of presidents have been
   observed over the years. In recent decades, the presidential nominees
   of the Democratic and Republican parties have been either incumbent
   presidents, sitting or former vice presidents, sitting or former U.S.
   Senators, or sitting or former state Governors. The last major nominee
   from either party who had not previously served in such an office was
   General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the Republican nomination and
   ultimately the presidency in the 1952 election. Chester A. Arthur had
   held no federal or statewide office, before becoming Vice President and
   then President following the assassination of President James A.
   Garfield in 1881.

   The U.S. Secretary of State used to be a stepping-stone to the White
   House, with five of the six Presidents who served between 1801 and 1841
   previously holding that office. However, since 1841, only one Secretary
   of State has gone on to be President (James Buchanan).

   Fourteen Presidents have previously served as Vice President. However
   only John Adams (1796), Thomas Jefferson (1800), Martin Van Buren
   (1836), Richard Nixon (1968) and George H. W. Bush (1988) began their
   first term after winning an election. Among the remaining nine who
   began their first term as President according to the presidential line
   of succession after their respective predecessor died or resigned from
   office, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and
   Lyndon B. Johnson were reelected. John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew
   Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, and Gerald Ford served as President but
   never won any presidential election. Ford had been appointed to the
   Vice Presidency through the processes of the Twenty-fifth Amendment and
   lost the 1976 presidential election, making him the only President to
   have never been elected to national office.

   In the 2008 election, the nominees of both major parties, Barack Obama
   and John McCain, were sitting U.S. Senators. Before 2008, fifteen
   presidents previously served in the Senate, including four of the five
   Presidents who served between 1945 and 1974. However, only two out of
   those fifteen were sitting U.S. Senators at the time they were elected
   president (Warren G. Harding in 1920 and John F. Kennedy in 1960).
   Major-party candidate Senators Andrew Jackson (1824), Lewis Cass
   (1848), Stephen Douglas (1860), Barry Goldwater (1964), George McGovern
   (1972), and John Kerry (2004) all lost their elections. Only one
   sitting member of the House of Representatives has been elected
   president (James A. Garfield in 1880), although eighteen presidents
   have been former members of the House.

   Despite Obama's tenure, contemporary electoral success has clearly
   favored state governors. Of the last six presidents, four (Jimmy
   Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush) have been
   governors of a state. Geographically, these presidents were from either
   very large states (California, Texas) or from a state south of the
   Mason-Dixon Line and east of Texas (Georgia, Arkansas). In all, sixteen
   presidents have been former governors, including seven who were in
   office as governor at the time of their election to the presidency.
   Other major-party candidates who were also state governors include
   Michael Dukakis (1988), and Mitt Romney (2012).

   After leaving office, one President, William Howard Taft, served as
   Chief Justice of the United States. Only two Presidents, John Quincy
   Adams (serving in the House) and Andrew Johnson (serving in the
   Senate), have served in Congress after being President. John Quincy
   Adams however is the only former President to be elected to federal
   office; when Andrew Johnson served as a Senator, state legislatures
   appointed the Senators.

Technology and media[edit]

   Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential
   campaigns. The invention of both radio and television have given way to
   the reliance of national political advertisements across those methods
   of communication. National advertisements such as Lyndon B. Johnson's
   1964 commercial "Daisy", Ronald Reagan's 1984 commercial "Morning in
   America", and George H.W. Bush's 1988 commercial "Revolving Door"
   became major factors in those respective elections. In 1992, George H.
   W. Bush's broken promise of "Read my lips: no new taxes" was
   extensively used in the commercials of Bill Clinton and Bush's other
   opponents with significant effect during the campaign.

   Since the development of the Internet in the mid-90s, Internet activism
   has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns,
   especially since 2000. The internet was first used in the 1996
   presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate
   online.^[10] It was only used by a few candidates and there is no
   evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election
   cycle.^[10]

   In 2000, both candidates (George W. Bush and Al Gore) created,
   maintained and updated their campaign website. But it was not until the
   2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the
   internet seen. By the summer of 2003, ten people competing in the 2004
   presidential election had developed campaign websites.^[11] Howard
   Dean’s campaign website from that year was considered a model for all
   future campaign websites. His website played a significant role in his
   overall campaign strategy.^[12] It allowed his supporters to read about
   his campaign platform and provide feedback, donate, get involved with
   the campaign, and connect with other supporters.^[13] A Gallup poll
   from January 2004 revealed that 49 percent of Americans have used the
   internet to get information about candidates, and 28 percent said that
   they use the internet to get this information frequently.^[14]

   In 2008, the internet became a grassroots and a voice of the people
   tool-a way for the users to connect with each other and with the
   campaign, like Dean’s website had done in 2004. All of the major
   candidates had a website and utilized social networking like facebook
   and myspace. The popularity of a candidate could be measured by the
   number of ‘friends’ on these sites as well as on websites like Hitwise,
   which listed the number of hits all of the presidential candidate’s
   websites had each week.

   Internet channels such as YouTube were used by candidates to share
   speeches and ads for free. This also served as a forum for users to
   attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.^[14]

   A study done by the Pew Internet & American Life Project in conjunction
   with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that
   54 percent of adults in the United States used the internet to get
   information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific
   candidates. This represents 73 percent of adult internet users. The
   study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used social
   network sites or Twitter to get information about and discuss the
   elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about
   or participate in campaigns.^[15]

   E-campaigning as it has come to be called, is subject to very little
   regulation. On March 26, 2006 the Federal Election Commission voted
   unanimously to “not regulate political communication on the Internet,
   including emails, blogs and the creating of Web sites”^[16] This
   decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to
   campaign finance limitations.^[17] A comment was made about this
   decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc. that explain this
   loophole in the context of a political campaign, "A wealthy individual
   could purchase all of the e-mail addresses for registered voters in a
   congressional district . . . produce an Internet video ad, and e-mail
   it along with a link to the campaign contribution page..Not only would
   this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent
   expenditure requirements; it would never even need to be reported”^[16]

     States won by Democrat Barack Obama by 4–8 percentage points

   Today, major parts of the presidential election process remain
   controversial. Because of the staggered nature of the primary season,
   voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other small states which
   traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses first in January
   usually have a major impact on the races. Conversely, voters in
   California and other large states which traditionally hold their
   primaries last in June usually have no say because the races are
   usually over by then. As a result, more states vie for earlier
   primaries to claim a greater influence in the process. Primary and
   caucus reform proposals include a National Primary held on a single
   day; or the Interregional Primary Plan, where states would be grouped
   into six regions, and each of the regions would rotate every election
   on who would hold their primaries first.

   With the primary races usually over before June, the political
   conventions have mostly become scripted, ceremonial affairs. As the
   drama has left the conventions, and complaints grown that they were
   scripted and dull pep rallies, viewership has fallen off. After
   formerly offering gavel-to-gavel coverage of the major party
   conventions in the mid-20th Century, the Big Three television networks
   now only devote approximately three hours of coverage (one hour per
   night).

   Critics argue that the Electoral College is archaic and inherently
   undemocratic. With most states using a winner-take-all system, both the
   Democratic Party and the Republican Party candidates are all but
   certain to win all the electoral votes from the predominately
   Democratic and Republican states, respectively. This gives certain
   swing states, states in which no single candidate or party has
   overwhelming support, disproportionate influence. Thus, presidential
   candidates usually spend exponentially more time, money, and energy
   campaigning in a historically swing state like Ohio than either a
   Democratic state like California or a Republican state like Texas.
   Furthermore, a candidate can win the electoral vote without securing
   the greatest amount of the popular vote, such as during the 1824, 1876,
   1888, and 2000 elections. Proposed reforms include the National Popular
   Vote Interstate Compact, an interstate compact whereby individual
   participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the
   winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective
   statewide results.

Voter turnout[edit]

   See also: Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections

   Voter turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections showed a noticeable
   increase over the turnout in 1996 and 2000. Prior to 2004, voter
   turnout in presidential elections had been decreasing while voter
   registration, measured in terms of voting age population (VAP) by the
   U.S. Census, has been increasing. The VAP figure, however, includes
   persons ineligible to vote — mainly non-citizens and ineligible felons
   — and excludes overseas eligible voters. Opinion is mixed on whether
   this decline was due to voter apathy [1] ^[25]^[26]^[27] or an increase
   in ineligible voters on the rolls.^[28] The difference between these
   two measures are illustrated by analysis of turnout in the 2004 and
   2008 elections. Voter turnout from the 2004 and 2008 election was "not
   statistically different," based on the voting age population used by a
   November 2008 U.S. Census survey of 50,000 households [2]. If expressed
   in terms of vote eligible population (VEP), the 2008 national turnout
   rate was 61.7% from 131.3 million ballots cast for president, an
   increase of over 1.6 percentage points over the 60.1% turnout rate of
   2004, and the highest since 1968.^[29]

Financial disclosures[edit]

   Prior to 1967, many presidential candidates disclosed assets, stock
   holdings, and other information which might affect the public
   trust.^[30] In that year, Republican candidate George W. Romney went a
   step further and released his tax returns for the previous twelve
   years.^[30] Since then, many presidential candidates – including all
   major-party nominees since 1980 – have released some of their
   returns,^[31] although few of the major party nominees have equaled or
   exceeded George Romney's twelve.^[32]^[33]

Presidential coattails[edit]

   Main article: Coattail effect

   Presidential elections are held on the same date as those for all the
   seats in the United States House of Representatives, the full terms for
   33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate, the
   governorships in several U.S. states, as well as many state and local
   elections. Presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who
   then vote for his party's candidates for those other offices. Members
   of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are also more likely to
   be voted for on a year of the presidential election than a
   midterm.^[34] In effect, these other candidates are said to ride on his
   coattails.

       electoral votes for elections including and before 1820.

   24. ^ Byrd was not directly on the 1960 ballot. Instead, his electoral
       votes came from several unpledged electors and a faithless elector.
       The claim that Kennedy received a plurality of the votes can only
       be sustained if those votes cast for unpledged Democratic electors
       are tabulated as Kennedy's, even if they did not vote for him. If
       these votes are excluded from Kennedy's total, Nixon had the
       national popular-vote plurality.
