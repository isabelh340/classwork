Southwestern United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Regional definitions vary from source to source. New Mexico and Arizona
   (in dark red) are almost always considered the core, modern-day
   Southwest. The striped states may or may not be considered part of the
   same region. With the exception of Texas and Oklahoma (offset in blue),
   the southwestern states are also classified as West by the US Census
   Bureau.^[1]

   The Southwestern United States (also known as the American Southwest or
   simply the Southwest^[2]) is a region of the United States defined in
   different ways by different sources. Broad definitions include nearly a
   quarter of the United States, including Arizona, California, Colorado,
   Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. Narrowly defined, the
   "core" Southwest is centered around the Four Corner states, with parts
   of the other states making up the beginnings and endings of the
   Southwest. The five main southwestern states, Arizona, New Mexico,
   Colorado, Utah, and Nevada, are also all considered part of the
   Mountain West as well as the Southwest. The total population of these
   states is roughly 19 million people. The top 5 biggest cities in the
   Southwest (in order) are: Phoenix, El Paso, Denver, Las Vegas, and
   Albuquerque.

   Most of it was a part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, in the Spanish
   Empire, during the Modern Era. What is now California, Arizona, Nevada,
   Utah, New Mexico, and portions of Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma and
   Kansas were part of Mexico before the Mexican-American War and the
   Gadsden Purchase of 1853. Portions of some of the areas in the
   "divided" states, and including western parts of Texas, beginning in
   San Antonio, were those in dispute after the Texas Revolution.

              Panoramic view of the southwestern United States.

   Geographer Uriah D. W. Meinig defines the core of the Southwest as the
   portion of New Mexico west of the Llano Estacado and the portion of
   Arizona east of the Mohave-Sonoran Desert and south of the
   "canyonlands" and also including the El Paso district of western Texas
   and the southernmost part of Colorado.^[3] He identifies four distinct
   subregions with this core. He calls the first subregion "Northern New
   Mexico", and describes it as focused on Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It
   extends from the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado to south of
   Socorro and including the Manzano Mountains, with an east-west
   breadth^[4] in the north stretching from the upper Canadian River to
   the upper San Juan River. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes
   called Central New Mexico.

   "Central Arizona" is a vast metropolitan area spread across one
   contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the Phoenix
   metropolitan area. The city of Phoenix is the largest urban center, and
   located in the approximate center of the area that includes Tempe,
   Mesa, and many others.^[5]

                  The Delicate Arch at Arches National Park

   Meinig calls the third subregion "El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern
   Borderlands". While El Paso and Tucson are distinctly different cities
   they share a similar and somewhat overlapping hinterland between them.
   Tucson occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson
   corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation
   trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There
   are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both
   El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; Fort Bliss
   and White Sands Missile Range north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near
   Tucson, the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Albuquerque has Sandia
   National Laboratories and Kirtland Air Force Base. About 70 miles
   (110 km) to the southeast are the research facilities at Fort Huachuca.
   These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El
   Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential
   communities such as Sierra Vista, Las Cruces, and Alamogordo. El Paso's
   influence extends north into the Mesilla Valley, and southeast along
   the Rio Grande into the Trans-Pecos region of Texas.^[6]

      Four Corners Monument, often considered the heart of the American
                                  Southwest

   The fourth subregion Meinig calls the "Northern Corridor and
   Navaholands". A major highway and railway trunk connects Albuquerque
   and Flagstaff. Just north of the transportation trunk are large blocks
   of American Indian land.^[7]

   Phoenix, Tucson, and Las Vegas dominate the westernmost metropolitan
   areas in the southwestern region, while Albuquerque, Denver, Colorado
   Springs, and El Paso dominate the easternmost metropolitan areas of the
   Southwest, not including Northern, Central, and Eastern Texas or
   Oklahoma because they are not always considered part of the Southwest.
   Reno and Salt Lake City also dominate the northernmost metropolitan
   areas of the Southwest. Thus the basic spatial structure of the
   Southwest can be seen as focused on the largest metropolitan areas in
   each state such as Phoenix, Albuquerque, Denver, Salt Lake City, Las
   Vegas, and El Paso. Also, the Four Corners of Colorado, Utah, Arizona,
   and New Mexico is often considered the center, or heart, of the
   American Southwest.^[8]

                Ancient Pueblo Peoples ruins at Chaco Canyon

   Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the southwestern United States was
   inhabited by a very large population of American Indian tribes. Some of
   the larger and more popular tribes of American Indians in the Southwest
   were the Ute, Navajo, Apache, Comanche, Paiute, Hopi, and Anasazi. The
   Ute formally ruled over most of modern day Utah and Colorado, as well
   as small parts of northern New Mexico. The Navajo had ruled over much
   of Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Utah at one point as well. Apache
   tribes had once ruled over many lands in the Southwest such as most of
   New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and parts of southwestern Texas. The
   Jicarilla tribe of Apache also ruled well into southern and
   southeastern Colorado as well. The Comanche ruled many lands in the
   Southwest as well. Their historic range consisted of present day
   eastern New Mexico, southern and southeastern Colorado, northeastern
   Arizona, and most all of west and northwest Texas. The Paiute people
   were another very large American Indian civilization. They controlled
   most all of present day Nevada, western Utah, and northern Arizona.
   Some of the oldest evidence of American Indians in the Southwest are
   the Hopi and the Anasazi people. The Hopi controlled most all of what
   is modern day Arizona at one point. On the other hand, the Anasazi
   (Ancient Pueblo peoples) controlled much of the Southwest as well.
   Their ancient territory consisted of northeastern Arizona, northwestern
   New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and all of southern Colorado. Some of
   the more known evidence of the ancient pueblo peoples can be found at
   Chaco National Park in New Mexico, and Mesa Verde National Park in
   Colorado.

Origins of the term and historical/cultural variations[edit]

   The term "Southwest" originally referred to a "major subregion" of the
   American South, literally being the western frontier of the larger
   region. This "Old Southwest" of the 19th century included, at varying
   points in time, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas,
   and Louisiana. After its revolution and statehood, Texas became
   considered part of this designation. However, as territories and
   eventual states to the west were added after the Mexican–American War,
   the geographical "Southwest" expanded, and the relationship of these
   new acquisitions to the South itself became "increasingly unclear."^[9]

   Texas has long been the focal point of this dichotomy, and is often
   considered, as such, the core area of "the South's Southwest."^[9]
   While the Trans-Pecos area is generally acknowledged as part of the
   desert Southwest,^[10] most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are
   often placed into a sub-region of the South, which some consider
   southwestern in the general framework of the original application,
   meaning the "Western South". This is an area containing the basic
   elements of Southern history, culture, politics, religion, and
   linguistic and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the
   frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in
   many ways from the classic "Old South" or Southeast, these features are
   strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite
   different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to
   the west.

   One of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas—in addition to
   being a Confederate state during the Civil War—is that Indigenous and
   Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development
   of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority
   of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.^[11] Although the
   present day state of Oklahoma was Indian Territory until the early 20th
   century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern
   United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority
   of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy
   during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open
   for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number
   of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a
   character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large
   American Indian populations.^[11]

   The fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma—unlike
   those in other "southwestern" states—self-identify as living in the
   South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and
   westerners—also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat
   distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.^[12]

Vegetation and terrain[edit]

   The High Plains in Eastern New Mexico, but also located in Eastern
   Colorado and West Texas.

   Vegetation of the Southwest generally includes various types of yucca,
   along with saguaro cactus, barrel cactus, prickly pear cactus, desert
   spoon, creosote bush, sagebrush, and greasewood. Although, cacti is
   thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow
   throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and West Texas. Also, small cacti
   grow in Utah and Colorado. These examples (except the saguaro), can be
   seen growing natively and in large numbers more east throughout the
   Texas Hill Country and South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. However,
   none of the vegetation discussed grows natively the further east than
   the eastern outskirts of Fort Worth. Dallas and Houston, for example,
   share a similar terrain with states further east and are often
   considered more of the American South. In the far eastern parts of the
   Southwest, prairies and grasslands are found all over. These prairies
   and grasslands are usually located in Eastern Colorado, Eastern New
   Mexico, and large areas in West Texas. Steppe is also located all over
   the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The mountains
   of the southwestern states have large alpine trees.

   Landscape features of the core southwestern areas usually include
   mountains, mesas, high broad basins, plateaus, desert lands, and some
   plains. The High Plains region of the Great Plains is also located in
   the American Southwest. Eastern Colorado, Eastern New Mexico, and West
   Texas all have high plains, and rolling land. The entire southwestern
   region features semi-arid to arid terrain. The far eastern part of
   southwestern Texas, for example the Texas Hill Country, consists of
   dry, tall, and rugged rocky hills of limestone and granite. South Texas
   and the Rio Grande Valley is mostly flat with many places consisting of
   scrub and bare topsoil, much like the deserts further west. Buttes are
   also located all over the southwestern states. Utah tends to have the
   most natural buttes, but they do form as far east as some parts of
   Central Texas.

Wildlife[edit]

   Desert bighorn sheep

   There is a wide variety of wildlife in the southwestern United States.
   Bighorn sheep, bobcat, coyote, bear, jackrabbit, cottontail rabbit,
   mule deer, white-tailed deer, gray fox, mountain lion, river otter,
   porcupine, pronghorn, raccoon, armadillo, Mexican wolf, and gray wolf
   can be found in all states across the Southwest. American bison and
   prairie dogs can be found in the southwestern states of Colorado, New
   Mexico, and Texas. Elk in the Southwest are usually only found in
   Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. White-nosed coati and collared
   peccary in the Southwest are normally found in Arizona, New Mexico, and
   Texas. Snakes are also found all over the southwestern United States.
   Rattlesnakes are found in the Southwest. Coral snakes can be found in
   Arizona, New Mexico & Texas.

   Sonoran Desert terrain near Tucson

   The southwestern United States features a semi-arid to arid climate,
   depending on the location. Much of the Southwest is an arid desert
   climate, but higher elevations in the mountains in each state, with the
   exception of West Texas, feature alpine climates with very large
   amounts of snow. The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas,
   and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly
   desert lands with mountains. However, the metro areas of Reno, Salt
   Lake City, Denver, and Colorado Springs can receive significant
   snowfalls. Albuquerque falls in between, receiving less snow than other
   cities, but still receive significant snowfalls in the winter time.
   Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United
   States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the
   higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.

   Nevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and
   mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations
   in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally
   arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. Colorado and New Mexico
   do have high plains in the far eastern portions of their state. They
   all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the
   high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far
   southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all.
   West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same
   amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high
   elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat,
   rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with
   some hills, and there are significant mountains as well once you reach
   the Trans-Pecos area.

   The term "High Desert" is also synonymous with this region. The High
   Desert is generally defined as the Mojave Desert, which extends from
   inland southern California into southern Nevada and southwestern Utah.
   The Great Basin Desert is defined as the desert lands in Nevada,
   Western Utah, as well as Southeastern Oregon and Southern Idaho. The
   High Desert also extends into other parts of the Northwest, such as the
   Red Desert in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different
   from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert.
   This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation,
   much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold
   temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California,
   southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on
   very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of
   snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern
   Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.
   Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado

   Other areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the "High
   Desert" such as the Colorado Plateau. The desert lands found in Eastern
   Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico are usually referred
   to as the high desert. Eastern Utah has a huge mass of desert land,
   which sits at a high elevation, and is sometimes referred to as the
   "High Desert" as well. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in
   southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the
   state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas
   such as, the Roan Plateau, Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado
   National Monument, Royal Gorge, Cortez, Dove Creek, Canyon of the
   Ancients National Monument, Four Corners Monument, Montrose, Blue Mesa
   Reservoir, Pueblo, San Luis Valley, and the Great Sand Dunes. Besides
   the Chihuahuan Desert, lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico,
   they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern
   portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.

   During El Niño, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter
   across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion
   stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Niña, the
   opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay
   further north.

National monuments and parks[edit]

   The Grand Canyon

Ethnicity[edit]

           Phoenix, the largest metropolitan area in the southwest

   Denver, the second largest metropolitan area in the Southwest
   Las Vegas, the third largest metropolitan area in the Southwest
   Salt Lake City, the fourth largest metropolitan area in the Southwest
   Albuquerque, the fifth largest metropolitan area in the Southwest
   El Paso, the sixth largest metropolitan area in the Southwest

   The Southwest is ethnically varied, with significant Anglo American and
   Hispanic American populations in addition to more regional African
   American, Asian American, and American Indian populations.

   Hispanic Americans (mostly Mexican Americans, with large populations of
   Spanish Americans) can be found in large numbers in every major city in
   the Southwest such as El Paso (80%), San Antonio (61%), Albuquerque
   (47%), Phoenix (43%), Tucson (41%), Austin (35%), Denver (32%), Las
   Vegas (32%), Reno (22%), Salt Lake City (22%), Colorado Springs (16%),
   and Provo (15.2%). Houston (44%), Dallas (43%), and Fort Worth (34%)
   have large Latino populations as well but are not always considered
   part of the Southwest and are often grouped more with the South.

   Very large Hispanic American populations can also be found in the
   smaller cities such as, Flagstaff (18%), Yuma (55%), Mesa (27%), Ogden
   (30%), St. George (10%), Las Cruces (56%), Santa Fe (48%), Farmington
   (22%), Roswell (51%), Alamogordo (32%), Pueblo (48%), Greeley (35%),
   Longmont (25%), Brighton (41%), Carson City (20%), Amarillo (27%),
   Lubbock (31%), Midland (37%) and Odessa (47%). Many small towns
   throughout the southwestern states also have significantly large Latino
   populations.

   The largest African American populations in the Southwest can be found
   in Denver (10%), Las Vegas (10%), Colorado Springs (7%), and Phoenix
   (5%). The Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston areas both have very large
   African American populations, although those parts of Texas are not
   usually considered part of the southwestern United States.

   The largest Asian American populations in the southwest can be found in
   Nevada and Utah, with some other significant Asian populations in
   Denver and Phoenix. The most significant American Indian populations
   can be found in New Mexico and Arizona.

Cities and urban areas[edit]

   The area also contains many of the nation's largest cities and
   metropolitan areas, despite relatively low population density in rural
   areas. Phoenix is among the top ten most populous cities in the
   country, and Reno, Albuquerque, Colorado Springs, and Salt Lake
   City^[13] are some of the fastest-growing cities in America. Also, the
   region as a whole has witnessed some of the highest population growth
   in the United States; and according to the US Census Bureau, in
   2008–2009, Utah was the fastest growing state in America. As of the
   2010 Census, Nevada was the fastest growing state in the United States,
   with an increase of 35.1% in the last ten years. Additionally, Arizona
   (24.6%), Utah (23.8%), Texas (20.6%), and Colorado (16.9%) were all in
   the top ten fastest growing states as well.^[14]

In sports[edit]

   Among the major sports leagues, the National Basketball Association has
   had a Southwest Division since 2004. It includes teams from Texas,
   Tennessee and Louisiana. In addition, there are NBA teams in Denver
   (Denver Nuggets), Phoenix (Phoenix Suns), and Salt Lake City (Utah
   Jazz), as well as four teams in California, sometimes considered part
   of the Southwest.^[citation needed] The WNBA has one team in the
   Southwest area, the Phoenix Mercury. The National Collegiate Athletic
   Association has had two Division I conferences named Southwest. The
   Southwest Conference was active from 1914 to 1996 and featured teams
   from Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The Southwestern Athletic
   Conference, established in 1920, has comprised teams from Texas,
   Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. Major League
   Baseball has teams in Arizona and Colorado, as well as five teams in
   California and two teams in Texas.
