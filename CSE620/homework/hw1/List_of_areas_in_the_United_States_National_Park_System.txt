   National Park Service logo.

   The National Park System of the United States is the collection of
   physical properties owned or administered by the National Park Service.
   This includes all areas designated national parks and most national
   monuments, as well as several other types of protected areas of the
   United States.

   As of 2013, there are 401 units of the National Park System. However,
   this number is somewhat misleading. For example: Denali National Park
   and Preserve is counted as two units, whereas Fort Moultrie is not
   counted as a unit because it is considered a feature of the Fort Sumter
   National Monument.

   In addition to areas of the National Park System, the National Park
   Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several
   affiliated areas authorized by Congress. Affiliated areas are marked on
   the lists below.

   The National Register of Historic Places is administered by the Park
   Service (with nearly 79,000 entries) and automatically includes all
   National Park System areas designated due to their historic
   significance. This includes all National Historical Parks/Historic
   Sites, National Battlefields/Military Parks, National Memorials, and
   some National Monuments.

   Units are found in all 50 states, in Washington, D.C., and in the U.S.
   territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the
   U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.

   Nearly all units managed by the National Park Service participate in
   the National Park Passport Stamps program.
