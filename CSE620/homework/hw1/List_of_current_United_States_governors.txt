   The current term ends in January of the given year for every state
   except Alaska, Hawaii, and Kentucky, where the term ends in December of
   the year of election. The notation (term limits) after the year
   indicates that the current governor is ineligible to seek re-election
   in that year; the notation (retiring) indicates that the current
   governor has announced their intention not to seek re-election at the
   end of the term or to run for another office.
