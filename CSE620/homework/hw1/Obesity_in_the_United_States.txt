Obesity in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   According to 2007 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO),
   the United States has the highest prevalence of overweight adults in
   the Anglosphere.^[1]
   Historical U.S. obesity rate, 1960–2004^[2]

   Obesity in the United States has been increasingly cited as a major
   health issue in recent decades. While many industrialized countries
   have experienced similar increases, obesity rates in the United States
   are among the highest in the world.^[3]

   Obesity has continued to grow within the United States. There are many
   reasons why obesity has increased, some of which are related to finance
   and physical fitness. As a result, many people with obesity have or
   will experience medical complications. Diet and physical activity are
   methods of preventing and reducing obesity. People who partake in
   regular exercise and eat healthy foods will feel the personal benefits
   as well. Many overweight Americans have not realized the health
   importance of a lower body weight and therefore have done nothing to
   reduce their obesity.^[clarification needed]

   One out of every three Americans is now considered to be obese. During
   the early 21st century, America often contained the highest percentage
   of obese people in the world. Obesity has led to over 120,000
   preventable deaths each year in the United States. An obese person in
   America is likely to incur $1,497 more in medical expenses annually.
   Approximately $190 billion is spent in added medical expenses per year
   within the United States. Obesity is a preventable disease that has
   been increasing within the United States. Health authorities anticipate
   no change to this vector.

   The United States had the highest rate of obesity for large countries,
   until obesity rates in Mexico surpassed that of the United States in
   2013.^[4] From 13% obesity in 1962, estimates have steadily increased.
   The following statistics comprise adults age 20 and over living at or
   near the poverty level. The obesity percentages for the overall US
   population are higher.^[clarification needed] reaching 19.4% in 1997,
   24.5% in 2004,^[5] 26.6% in 2007,^[6] and 33.8% (adults) and 17%
   (children) in 2008.^[7]^[8] In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention (CDC) reported higher numbers once more, counting 35.7%
   of American adults as obese, and 17% of American children.^[9]

   According to a study in The Journal of the American Medical Association
   (JAMA), in 2008, the obesity rate among adult Americans was estimated
   at 32.2% for men and 35.5% for women; these rates were roughly
   confirmed by the CDC again for 2009–2010. Using different criteria, a
   Gallup survey found the rate was 26.1% for U.S. adults in 2011, up from
   25.5% in 2008. Though the rate for women has held steady over the
   previous decade, the obesity rate for men continued to increase between
   1999 and 2008, the JAMA study notes. Moreover, "The prevalence of
   obesity for adults aged 20 to 74 years increased by 7.9 percentage
   points for men and by 8.9 percentage points for women between 1976–1980
   and 1988–1994, and subsequently by 7.1 percentage points for men and by
   8.1 percentage points for women between 1988–1994 and
   1999–2000."^[10]^[11]

   Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately
   100,000–400,000 deaths in the United States per year^[12] and has
   increased health care use and expenditures,^[13]^[14]^[15]^[16] costing
   society an estimated $117 billion in direct (preventive, diagnostic,
   and treatment services related to weight) and indirect (absenteeism,
   loss of future earnings due to premature death) costs.^[17] This
   exceeds health-care costs associated with smoking or problem
   drinking^[16] and accounts for 6% to 12% of national health care
   expenditures in the United States.^[18]

Prevalence[edit]

   Obesity rates have increased for all population groups in the United
   States over the last several decades.^[12] Between 1986 and 2000, the
   prevalence of severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m^2) quadrupled from one in
   two hundred Americans to one in fifty. Extreme obesity (BMI ≥
   50 kg/m^2) in adults increased by a factor of five, from one in two
   thousand to one in four hundred.^[19]

   There have been similar increases seen in children and adolescents,
   with the prevalence of overweight in pediatric age groups nearly
   tripling over the same period. Approximately nine million children over
   six years of age are considered obese. Several recent studies have
   shown that the rise in obesity in the US is slowing, possibly explained
   by saturation of health-oriented media or a biological limit on
   obesity.^[19]

Race[edit]

   Rates of obesity in US by race.

   Obesity is distributed unevenly across racial groups in the United
   States.^[20]

Caucasian[edit]

   The obesity rate for Caucasian adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010
   was 26.8%.^[21] For adult Caucasian men, the rate of obesity was 27.5%
   in 2010.^[22] For adult Caucasian women, the rate of obesity was 24.5%
   in 2010.^[22]

Black or African American[edit]

   The obesity rate for Black adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was
   36.9%.^[21] For adult Black men, the rate of obesity was 31.6% in
   2010.^[22] For adult Black women, the rate of obesity was 41.2% in
   2010.^[22]

American Indian or Alaska Native[edit]

   The obesity rate for American Indian or Alaska Native adults (over 30
   BMI) in the US in 2010 was 39.6%.^[21] No gender breakdown was given
   for American Indian or Alaska Native adults in the CDC figures.^[21]

Asian[edit]

   The obesity rate for Asian adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was
   11.6%.^[21] No gender breakdown was given for Asian adults in the CDC
   figures.^[21]

Hispanic or Latino[edit]

   The obesity rate for the Hispanic or Latino adults category (over 30
   BMI) in the US in 2010 was 31.9%.^[21] For the overall Hispanic or
   Latino men category, the rate of obesity was 30.7% in 2010.^[22] For
   the overall Hispanic or Latino women category, the rate of obesity was
   33.1% in 2010.^[22]

Mexican or Mexican Americans[edit]

   Within the Hispanic or Latino category, obesity statistics for Mexican
   or Mexican Americans were provided, with no gender breakdown.^[21] The
   obesity rate for Mexican or Mexican Americans adults (over 30 BMI) in
   the US in 2010 was 34.1%.^[21]

Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander[edit]

   The obesity rate for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander adults
   (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 43.5%.^[21] No gender breakdown was
   given for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander adults in the CDC
   figures.^[21]

Gender[edit]

   Over 66 million adults in U.S. are obese (30 million men and 36 million
   women). 74 million are overweight (42 million men and 32 million
   women).^[23]

Age group[edit]

   Historically, obesity primarily affected adults. This has changed in
   the last two decades. 15-25 percent of American children and
   adolescents are now obese. Children and adolescents who are obese are
   likely to be obese in adulthood and to develop obesity-related health
   problems.^[24]

Newborns[edit]

   Some newborns are oversized. This is more often a problem associated
   with a medical disorder. Unlike adults, neonates do not develop
   obesity. The number one cause of big babies is diabetes in their
   mother. The baby is not considered obese.^[citation needed]

Children and teens[edit]

   The rise of overweight among ages 6-19 in the US.

   From 1980 to 2008, the prevalence of obesity in children aged 6 to 11
   years tripled from 6.5% to 19.6%. The prevalence of obesity in
   teenagers more than tripled from 5% to 18.1% in the same time
   frame.^[25]

   Data from NHANES surveys (1976–1980 and 2003–2006) show that the
   prevalence of obesity has increased: for children aged 2–5 years,
   prevalence increased from 5.0% to 12.4%; for those aged 6–11 years,
   prevalence increased from 6.5% to 19.6%; and for those aged 12–19
   years, prevalence increased from 5.0% to 17.6%.^[26]

   In 2000, approximately 19% of children (ages 6–11) and 17% of
   adolescents (ages 12–19) were overweight and an additional 15% of
   children and adolescents were at risk to becoming overweight, based on
   their BMI.^[27]

   Analyses of the trends in high BMI for age showed no statistically
   significant trend over the four time periods (1999–2000, 2001–2002,
   2003–2004, and 2005–2006) for either boys or girls. Overall, in
   2003-2006, 11.3% of children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years
   were at or above the 97th percentile of the 2000 BMI-for-age growth
   charts, 16.3% were at or above the 95th percentile, and 31.9% were at
   or above the 85th percentile^[28]

   Trend analyses indicate no significant trend between 1999–2000 and
   2007-2008 except at the highest BMI cut point (BMI for age 97th
   percentile) among all 6- through 19-year-old boys. In 2007-2008, 9.5%
   of infants and toddlers were at or above the 95th percentile of the
   weight-for-recumbent-length growth charts. Among children and
   adolescents aged 2 through 19 years, 11.9% were at or above the 97th
   percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts; 16.9% were at or above the
   95th percentile; and 31.7% were at or above the 85th percentile of BMI
   for age.^[29]

   In summary, between 2003 and 2006, 11.3% of children and adolescents
   were obese and 16.3% were overweight. A slight increase was observed in
   2007 and 2008 when the recorded data shows that 11.9% of the children
   between 6 and 19 years old were obese and 16.9% were overweight. The
   data recorded in the first survey was obtained by measuring 8,165
   children over four years and the second was obtained by measuring 3,281
   children.

   "More than 80 percent of affected children become overweight adults,
   often with lifelong health problems."^[30] Children are not only highly
   at risk of diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure but
   obesity also takes a toll on the child's psychological development.
   Social problems can arise and have a snowball effect, causing low
   self-esteem which can later develop into eating disorders.

Elderly[edit]

   Although obesity is reported in the elderly, the numbers are still
   significantly lower than the levels seen in the young adult population.
   It is speculated that socioeconomic factors may play a role in this age
   group when it comes to developing obesity.^[31]

In the military[edit]

   An estimated sixteen percent of active duty U.S. military personnel
   were obese in 2004, with the cost of remedial bariatric surgery for the
   military reaching US$ 15 million in 2002. Obesity is currently the
   largest single cause for the discharge of uniformed personnel.^[32]

   In 2005, 9 million adults of ages 17 to 24, or 27%, were too overweight
   to be considered for service in the military.^[33]

   According to a 2012 research on young servicemen's autopsies revealed a
   large case of coronary disease problems occurring in large numbers to
   younger individuals who due to obesity had high cholesterol and blood
   pressure, which was prior to this commonly known in elderly folks.^[34]

Prevalence by state[edit]

   Obesity in the U.S., 2011, by state
   Obesity rates in the U.S., 1985–2010 by state

   The following figures were averaged from 2005–2007 adult data compiled
   by the CDC BRFSS program^[35] and 2003–2004 child data from the
   National Survey of Children's Health.^[36]^[37]

   Care should be taken in interpreting these numbers, because they are
   based on self-report surveys which asked individuals (or, in case of
   children and adolescents, their parents) to report their height and
   weight. Height is commonly overreported and weight underreported,
   sometimes resulting in significantly lower estimates. One study
   estimated the difference between actual and self-reported obesity as 7%
   among males and 13% among females as of 2002, with the tendency to
   increase.^[38]

   The long-running REGARDS study, published in the journal of Obesity in
   2013, brought in individuals from the nine census regions and measured
   their height and weight. The data collected disagreed with the data in
   the CDC's phone survey used to create the following chart. REGARDS
   found that the West North Central region (North Dakota, South Dakota,
   Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa), and East North Central region
   (Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana) were the worst in
   obesity numbers, not the East South Central region (Tennessee,
   Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky) as had been previously thought.^[39]
   Dr.P.H., professor in the Department of Biostatistics in the UAB School
   of Public Health George Howard explains that "Asking someone how much
   they weigh is probably the second worst question behind how much money
   they make," "From past research, we know that women tend to
   under-report their weight, and men tend to over-report their height."
   Howard said as far as equivalency between the self-reported and
   measured data sets, the East South Central region showed the least
   misreporting. "This suggests that people from the South come closer to
   telling the truth than people from other regions, perhaps because
   there’s not the social stigma of being obese in the South as there is
   in other regions."^[40]

Epidemiology[edit]

   Obesity is a chronic health problem. It is one of the biggest factors
   for a type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease. It is also associated
   with cancer (i.e. colorectal cancer), osteoarthritis, liver disease,
   sleep apnea, depression and other medical conditions that affect
   mortality and morbidity.^[41]

   According to the NHANES data, African American and Mexican American
   adolescents between 12 and 19 years old are more likely to be
   overweight than non-Hispanic White adolescents. The prevalence is 21%,
   23% and 14% respectively. Also, in a national survey of American Indian
   children 5–18 years old, 39 percent were found to be overweight or at
   risk for being overweight.^[42]

   A 2007 study found that receiving Food Stamps long term (24 months) was
   associated with a 50% increased obesity rate among female adults.^[43]

   Looking at the long-term consequences, overweight adolescents have a 70
   percent chance of becoming overweight or obese adults, which increases
   to 80 percent if one or more parent is overweight or obese. In 2000,
   the total cost of obesity for children and adults in the United States
   was estimated to be US$ 117 billion (US$ 61 billion in direct medical
   costs).

   Food consumption has increased with time. For example, annual per
   capita consumption of cheese was 4 pounds (1.8 kg) in 1909; 32 pounds
   (15 kg) in 2000; the average person consumed 389 grams (13.7 oz) of
   carbohydrates daily in 1970; 490 grams (17 oz) in 2000; 41 pounds
   (19 kg) of fats and oils in 1909; 79 pounds (36 kg) in 2000. In 1977,
   18% of an average person's food was consumed outside the home; in 1996,
   this had risen to 32%.^[44]

   Obesity levels per county 2004–2009.

   According to Cleveland Clinic, cultural, social, and environmental
   factors, among others, all affect eating behaviors.^[45]

Diet[edit]

   Fast food has been cited as a contributing factor to obesity in the
   United States by various sources over the years.^[46] Around one third
   of children aged 4 to 19 eat fast food every day in the U.S.^[47]

   Many of America’s favorite foods, including hamburgers, french fries
   and doughnuts, are high in fat and carbohydrate content. These food
   items are also relatively inexpensive and available at fast food chains
   across the country (for ex. value menu). These convenience foods are
   frequently fried and are high in calories. Consumption of foods
   exceedingly high in fat calories can lead to obesity. Many menu items
   at fast food establishments do not fulfill basic nutritional
   requirements of a healthy meal. In a 2010 report by the Rudd Center for
   Food Policy it was noted that less than 1% of children's meals
   combinations met nutrition standards recommended by experts.^[48]

   Fast food chains and restaurants have experienced improved sales with
   larger portion sizes.^[49]^[50] Research cited by the Center for
   Disease Control estimates restaurant meal sizes to be four times larger
   than they were in the 1950s.^[51]^[52]

   Three studies published in the United States shows a correlation
   between sweet soda and fruit drinks to obesity.^[53] The consumption of
   sweet soda and fruit drinks has more than doubled since the 1970s.^[53]
   The first study showed that "drinking sugary drinks was affecting genes
   that regulate weight and increased the genetic predisposition of a
   person to gain weight."^[53] The other two studies showed that "giving
   to children and adolescents calorie-free drinks like mineral water or
   soft drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners resulted in weight
   loss."^[53]

   One of the other two studies was conducted by Boston Children's
   Hospital who examined two groups of adolescents.^[53] The group which
   was encouraged to consume water or light sodas for a year gained 0.68
   kilograms (1.5 lb). The other group, which consumed sugary drinks,
   gained 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb).^[53] The third study was conducted by
   Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, Netherlands.^[53] They studied 641
   children ages four to eleven over 18 months.^[53] They were split into
   two groups. One group drank sweet and fruity drinks and the other group
   drank the same drink with sugarless sweeteners.^[53] The group that
   drank the drink that had sugarless sweeteners gained 6.39 kilograms
   (14.1 lb) on average compared to 7.36 kilograms (16.2 lb) on average by
   the other group.^[53]

Sedentary lifestyle[edit]

   A sedentary lifestyle is another possible contributing factor to
   obesity. A sedentary lifestyle is a type of lifestyle with no or
   irregular physical activity. Sedentary activities include sitting,
   reading, watching television, playing video games, and computer use for
   much of the day with little or no vigorous physical exercise. A
   sedentary lifestyle can contribute to many preventable causes of death.
   Screen time is the amount of time a person spends watching a screen
   such as a television, computer monitor, or mobile device. Excessive
   screen time is linked to negative health
   consequences.^[54]^[55]^[56]^[57] Much of the United States gets
   insufficient exercise. As Americans have become more sedentary in their
   lifestyles, obesity rates have risen. More than 60% of U.S. adults do
   not exercise as recommended, and approximately 25% of U.S adults are
   not active at all.^[58] Exercise prevents excess weight and helps
   maintain weight loss. Despite the well-known benefits of physical
   activity, many adults and many children lead a relatively sedentary
   lifestyle^[59]^[60] and are not active enough to achieve these health
   benefits. Being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and
   decreases unhealthy triglycerides.^[23]

Social changes[edit]

   People are generally social which carries over into their eating
   habits. As Sidney Mintz, professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins
   University said, "Interaction over food is the single most important
   feature of socializing."^[61] The business world typically transacts
   business deals over food. Along with other activities, such as when
   people get together to catch up, food is served. At parties, there is
   food everywhere, at sports gatherings, food concession stands are
   ubiquitous. Funerals become wakes where mourners eat as part of
   mourning.

   Technology such as televisions, cellular devices, and video games add
   on to the epidemic by increasing time spent in the home versus the time
   that could be spent being outside or doing some kind of physical
   activity. Not only have studies proven that children who watch more TV
   tend to have higher body fat percentage but that what they actually
   view can affect their eating habits.^[62] The approximate $10 billion
   spent annually for commercials to advertise food instills brand
   recognition and loyalty with children.^[63]

   But in 2011, researchers assessed the causal relationship between
   recent increases in female labor force participation and the increased
   prevalence of obesity among women and found no such causal link.^[64]
   However, as families have become increasingly busy, quality family time
   has decreased. Research has shown that families who frequently spend
   significant time eating dinner as a family tend to have lower rates of
   obesity among children.^[65]

Total costs to the US[edit]

   There has been an increase in obesity-related medical problems,
   including type II diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
   disability.^[13] In particular, diabetes has become the seventh leading
   cause of death in the United States,^[66] with the U.S. Department of
   Health and Human Services estimating in 2008 that fifty-seven million
   adults aged twenty and older were pre-diabetic, 23.6 million diabetic,
   with 90–95% of the latter being type 2-diabetic.^[67]

   Obesity has also been shown to increase the prevalence of complications
   during pregnancy and childbirth. Babies born to obese women are almost
   three times as likely to die within one month of birth and almost twice
   as likely to be stillborn than babies born to women of normal
   weight.^[68]

   Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately
   100,000–400,000 deaths in the United States per year^[12] (including
   increased morbidity in car accidents)^[69] and has increased health
   care use and expenditures,^[13]^[14]^[15]^[16] costing society an
   estimated $117 billion in direct (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment
   services related to weight) and indirect (absenteeism, loss of future
   earnings due to premature death) costs.^[17] This exceeds health-care
   costs associated with smoking or problem drinking^[16] and accounts for
   6% to 12% of national health care expenditures in the United
   States.^[18]

   The Medicare and Medicaid programs bear about half of this cost.^[16]
   Annual hospital costs for treating obesity-related diseases in children
   rose threefold, from US$ 35 million to US$ 127 million, in the period
   from 1979 to 1999,^[70] and the inpatient and ambulatory healthcare
   costs increased drastically by US$ 395 per person per year.^[15]

   These trends in healthcare costs associated with pediatric obesity and
   its comorbidities are staggering, urging the Surgeon General to predict
   that preventable morbidity and mortality associated with obesity may
   surpass those associated with cigarette smoking.^[14]^[71] Furthermore,
   the probability of childhood obesity persisting into adulthood is
   estimated to increase from approximately twenty percent at four years
   of age to approximately eighty percent by adolescence,^[72] and it is
   likely that these obesity comorbidities will persist into
   adulthood.^[73]

Anti-obesity efforts[edit]

   By 2013, there is evidence that some Americans have addressed the
   concern about obesity. This was done voluntarily, through dieting, and
   through legal means, by bans on junk food in schools.

   There was a decrease in obesity rates. However, there was a significant
   increase in Americans who have slipped into the "extremely obese"
   category. The extremely obese category includes individuals who are
   roughly 100 pounds (45 kg) over a healthy weight.^[74]

   Under pressure from parents and anti-obesity advocates, many school
   districts moved to ban sodas, junk foods, and candy from vending
   machines and cafeterias.^[75] State legislators in California, for
   example, passed laws banning the sale of machine-dispensed snacks and
   drinks in elementary schools in 2003, despite objections by the
   California-Nevada Soft Drink Association. The state followed more
   recently with legislation to prohibit their soda sales in high schools
   starting July 1, 2009, with the shortfall in school revenue to be
   compensated by an increase in funding for school lunch programs.^[76] A
   similar law passed by the Connecticut General Assembly in June 2005 was
   vetoed by governor Jodi Rell, who stated the legislation "undermines
   the control and responsibility of parents with school-aged
   children."^[77]

   In mid-2006, the American Beverage Association (including Cadbury
   Schweppes, Coca Cola, and PepsiCo) agreed to a voluntary ban on the
   sale of all high-calorie drinks and all beverages in containers larger
   than 8, 10 and 12 ounces in elementary, middle and high schools,
   respectively.^[78]^[79]

   Non-profit organizations such as HealthCorps work to educate people on
   healthy eating and advocate for healthy food choices in an effort to
   combat obesity.^[80]

   The American First Lady Michelle Obama is leading an initiative to
   combat childhood obesity entitled "Let's Move". Mrs. Obama says she
   aims to wipe out obesity "in a generation". Let's Move! has partnered
   with other programs.^[81] Walking and bicycling to school helps
   children increase their physical activity.^[82]

   In 2008, the state of Pennsylvania enacted a law, the "School Nutrition
   Policy Initiative," aimed at the elementary level. These “interventions
   included removing all sodas, sweetened drinks, and unhealthy snack
   foods from selected schools, 'social marketing' to encourage the
   consumption of nutritious foods and outreach to parents.”^[83] The
   results were a “50 percent drop in incidence of obesity and
   overweight”, as opposed to those individuals who were not part of the
   study.^[84]

   For two years, Duke University psychology and global health professor
   Gary Bennett and eight colleagues followed 365 obese patients who had
   already developed hypertension. They found that regular medical
   feedback, self-monitoring, and a set of personalized goals can help
   obese patients in a primary care setting lose weight and keep it
   off.^[85]

   Major United States manufacturers of processed food, aware of the
   possible contribution of their products to the obesity epidemic, met
   together and discussed the problem as early as April 8, 1999; however,
   a proactive strategy was considered and rejected. As a general rule,
   optimizing the amount of salt, sugar and fat in a product will improve
   its palatability, and profitability. Reducing salt, sugar and fat, for
   the purpose of public health, had the potential to decrease
   palatability and profitability.^[86]

Food labeling[edit]

   Ultimately, federal and local governments in the U.S. are willing to
   create political solutions that will reduce obesity ratings by
   “recommending nutrition education, encouraging exercise, and asking the
   food and beverage industry to promote healthy practices
   voluntarily.”^[87] In 2008 New York City was the first city to pass a
   “labeling bill” that “require[d] restaurants” in several cities and
   states to “post the caloric content of all regular menu items, in a
   prominent place and using the same font and format as the price.”^[88]

Accommodations[edit]

   Along with Obesity came the accommodations made of American products.
   Child-safety seats in 2006 became modified for the 250,000 obese U.S.
   children ages six and below. ^[89] The obese incur extra costs for
   themselves and airlines when flying. Weight is a major component to the
   formula that goes into the planes take off and for it to successfully
   fly to the desired destination. Due to the weight limits taken in
   consideration for flight in 2000, airlines spent $275 million on 350
   million additional gallons of fuel for compensation of additional
   weight to travel.^[89]
