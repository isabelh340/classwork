   A warning sign at the international boundary between the United States
   and Canada in Point Roberts, Washington.

   Illegal immigration to the United States, also referred to in the media
   as undocumented immigration, is the act by foreign nationals of
   entering the United States without government permission (i.e., a visa)
   and in violation of immigration law of the United States, or staying
   beyond the termination date of a visa, also in violation of the law. In
   2012 the Obama administration spent 18 billion dollars on immigration
   enforcement programs; more than the budget for all other federal law
   enforcement agencies that year combined.^[1]

   The illegal immigrant population of the United States in 2008 was
   estimated by the Center for Immigration Studies to be about 11 million
   people, down from 12.5 million people in 2007.^[2] Other estimates
   range from 7 to 30 million.^[3]^[4]^[5] According to a Pew Hispanic
   Center report, in 2004, 57% of illegal immigrants were from Mexico; 24%
   were from other Latin American countries, primarily from Central
   America;^[6] 9% were from Asia; 6% were from Europe and Canada; and 3%
   were from Africa and the rest of the world.^[6]

Profile and demographics[edit]

   Main article: Illegal immigrant population of the United States

   Illegal immigrants continue to exceed the number of legal immigrants —a
   trend that has held steady since the 1990s. While the majority of
   illegal immigrants continue to concentrate in places with existing
   large Hispanic communities, increasingly illegal immigrants are
   settling throughout the rest of the country.^[7]

   An estimated 14 million people live in families in which the head of
   household or the spouse is in the United States illegally.^[7] Illegal
   immigrants arriving in recent years tend to be better educated than
   those who have been in the country a decade or more. A quarter of all
   immigrants who have arrived in recent years have at least some college
   education. Nonetheless, illegal immigrants as a group tend to be less
   educated than other sections of the U.S. population: 49 percent haven't
   completed high school, compared with 9 percent of native-born Americans
   and 25 percent of legal immigrants.^[7]

   Illegal immigrants work in many sectors of the U.S. economy. According
   to National Public Radio in 2005, about 3 percent work in agriculture;
   33 percent have jobs in service industries; and substantial numbers can
   be found in construction and related occupations (16 percent), and in
   production, installation, and repair (17 percent).^[7] According to USA
   Today in 2006, about 4 percent work in farming; 21 percent have jobs in
   service industries; and substantial numbers can be found in
   construction and related occupations (19 percent), and in production,
   installation, and repair (15 percent), with 12% in sales, 10% in
   management, and 8% in transportation.^[8] Illegal immigrants have lower
   incomes than both legal immigrants and native-born Americans, but
   earnings do increase somewhat the longer an individual is in the
   country.^[7]

   A percentage^[quantify] of illegal immigrants do not remain
   indefinitely but do return to their country of origin; they are often
   referred to as "sojourners: they come to the United States for several
   years but eventually return to their home country."^[9]

Breakdown by state[edit]

   As of 2006,^[10] the following data table shows a spread of
   distribution of locations where illegal immigrants reside by state.

Number of illegal immigrants[edit]

   According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), different
   estimates of the total number of illegal immigrants vary depending on
   how the term is defined.^[11] There are also questions about data
   reliability.^[11] .Bo The GAO has stated, "it seems clear that the
   population of undocumented foreign-born persons is large and has
   increased rapidly."^[11] On April 26, 2006 the Pew Hispanic Center
   (PHC) estimated that in March 2005 the number of illegal immigrants in
   the U.S. ranged from 11.5 to 12 million individuals.^[12] This number
   was derived by a statistical method known as the "residual
   method".^[11] According to the General Accounting office the residual
   estimation (1) starts with a census count or survey estimate of the
   number of foreign-born residents who have not become U.S. citizens and
   (2) subtracts out estimated numbers of legally present individuals in
   various categories, based on administrative data and assumptions
   (because censuses and surveys do not ask about legal status). The
   remainder, or residual, represents an indirect estimate of the size of
   the illegal immigrant population.^[11] Using the residential method,
   several different estimates of the number of illegal immigrants present
   in the United States have been derived:
     * According to the General Accounting Office, DHS had variously
       estimated the size of the illegal immigrant population as of
       January 2000 as 7 million and 8.5 million.^[11]

   Some unofficial private estimates put the number even higher^[13]
     * In August, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) placed
       the illegal immigrant population at 10.5 million as of January
       2005, and indicates that if recent trends continued, the figure for
       January 2006 would be 11 million.^[14]
     * The Pew Hispanic Center's indirect estimate of the number of
       illegal immigrants as of 2006 was 11.5 million to 12 million. These
       estimates represented roughly one-third of the entire foreign-born
       population.^[15]

   From 2005 to 2009, the number of people entering the U.S. illegally
   declined by nearly 67%, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, from
   850,000 yearly average in the early 2000s to 300,000.^[16]

   In 2013, a DHS report estimating the size of the illegal immigrant
   population living in the U.S. said, "In summary, an estimated 11.4
   million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States in
   January 2012 compared to 11.5 million in January 2011. These results
   suggest little to no change in the unauthorized immigrant population
   from 2011 to 2012."^[17]

Children[edit]

   The Pew Hispanic Center determined that according to an analysis of
   Census Bureau data about 8 percent of children born in the United
   States in 2008 — about 340,000 — were offspring of illegal immigrants.
   In total, 4 million U.S.-born children of illegal immigrant parents
   resided in this country in 2009 (alongside 1.1 million foreign-born
   children of illegal immigrant parents).^[18] These infants are,
   according to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
   Constitution, American citizens from birth. These children are
   sometimes referred to as anchor babies by those opposed to this method
   of citizenship attained outside of the legal immigration
   process.^[citation needed]

   The majority of children that are born to parents who are undocumented
   migrants fail to graduate high school, averaging two fewer years of
   school than children of legal immigrants. Reasons for this
   under-performance are thought to include stress, pressure to work at a
   younger age, and not having the economic resources needed for higher
   education. ^[19]

Surge in immigration by unaccompanied children from Central America[edit]

   Main article: Children's immigration crisis

   In 2014 tens of thousands of women and children, many children
   unaccompanied by their parents, came to the United States from Central
   America. Most simply crossed the Rio Grande and turned themselves into
   to the Border Patrol, relying on the belief, partly well founded,^[20]
   that United States law made special provision for illegal immigrants
   who were children.

   The United States Department of Justice reported in June 2014 that it
   will provide around 100 lawyers and paralegals for the rising number of
   children illegally coming to the United States, without parents or
   relatives. Under this program, the federal government will issue $2
   million in grants to entice lawyers and paralegals to help illegal
   minors.^[21] Attorney General Eric Holder stated, "We're taking a
   historic step to strengthen our justice system and protect the rights
   of the most vulnerable members of society.” The Obama administration
   estimates roughly 60,000 unaccompanied children will come across the
   border to the US in 2014. Minors illegally coming across the border
   often end up in immigration courts without legal representation and
   know little English or about the U.S. justice system.^[22]^[23] A 2014
   Mother Jones article suggests many of these unaccompianied children are
   attempting to escape abusive situations.^[24] The provisions of the
   William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act
   of 2008, which give substantial rights and protection to unaccompanied
   children from countries which do have a common border with the United
   States such as the nations of Central America other than Mexico, made
   expeditious deportation of the large number of children from Central
   America who came to the United States in 2014 difficult and expensive,
   prompting a call by President Barack Obama for an emergency
   appropriation of $4 billion^[25] and resulting in discussions by the
   Department of Justice and Congress of how to interpret or revise the
   law in order to expedite handling large numbers of children under the
   act.^[20] One solution, proposed by the Department of Justice in July
   2014, is to move cases involving children and families with children to
   the head of the docket in immigration court.^[26]

Present-day countries of origin[edit]

   According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the countries of
   origin for the largest numbers of illegal immigrants are as follows
   (latest of 2009):^[10]
   Country of origin Raw number Percent of total Percent change 2000 to
                                                 2009

   China             120,000    1%               -37%
   Other             1,650,000  15%              -17%

   The Urban Institute estimates "between 65,000 and 75,000 undocumented
   Canadians currently live illegally in the United States."^[27]

Definition[edit]

   The categories of foreign-born people in the United States are:
     * US citizens born outside the United States (naturalized) ^[28]
     * US citizens born as citizens outside the United States
     * Foreign-born non-citizens with current status to reside and/or work
       in the US (documented) ^[29]
     * Foreign-born non-citizens in the United States that are prohibited
       from entry (illegal)^[30]

   Non-citizens residing in the United States are further subdivided into
   immigrants and non-immigrants. Immigrants are foreign-born non-citizens
   that are able to apply for citizenship. Non-immigrants are foreign-born
   non-citizens who are not able to apply for citizenship, which includes
   diplomatic staff, temporary workers, students, tourists, etc.^[citation
   needed]

   Non-citizen residents can become undocumented/illegal/criminal in one
   of four ways: by unauthorized entry, when the employer fails to pay
   worker documentation fees, by staying beyond the expiration date of
   their status or other authorization, or by violating the terms of legal
   entry.^[31]^[not in citation given]^[32]^[not in citation given]

Illegal entry[edit]

   Main article: Illegal entry § United States

   The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 6–7 million immigrants came to
   the United States via illegal entry, accounting for probably a little
   over half of the total population.^[32] There are an estimated half
   million illegal entries into the United States each year.^[32]^[33]

   A common means of border crossing is to hire people smugglers to help
   them across the border. Those operating on the US-Mexico border are
   known informally as "coyotes".^[33]

Visa overstay[edit]

   According to Pew, between 4 and 5.5 million foreigners entered the
   United States with a legal visa, accounting for between 33–50% of the
   total population.^[32] A tourist or traveler is considered a "visa
   overstay" once he or she remains in the United States after the time of
   admission has expired. The time of admission varies greatly from
   traveler to traveler depending on what visa class into which they were
   admitted. Visa overstays tend to be somewhat more educated and better
   off financially than those who entered the country illegally.^[34]

   To help track visa overstayers the US-VISIT (United States Visitor and
   Immigrant Status Indicator Technology) program collects and retains
   biographic, travel, and biometric information, such as photographs and
   fingerprints, of foreign nationals seeking entry into the United
   States. It also requires electronic readable passports containing this
   information.

   Visa overstayers mostly enter with tourist or business visas.^[32] In
   1994, more than half^[35] of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers
   whereas in 2006, about 45% of illegal immigrants were Visa
   overstayers.^[36]

   Those who leave the United States after overstaying their visa for more
   than 180 days but less than one year and then attempt to re-enter on a
   new visa will face a three year ban which will not allow them to
   re-enter the U.S. for that period.

Border Crossing Card violation[edit]

   A smaller number of illegal immigrants entered the United States
   legally using the Border Crossing Card, a card that authorizes border
   crossings into the U.S. for a set amount of time. Border Crossing Card
   entry accounts for the vast majority of all registered non-immigrant
   entry into the United States – 148 million out of 179 million total –
   but there is little hard data as to how much of the illegal immigrant
   population entered in this way. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates the
   number at around 250,000–500,000.^[32]

Causes[edit]

   Main article: Illegal immigration § Causes

   The United States is viewed worldwide as a highly desirable destination
   by would-be migrants. International polls by the Gallup organization
   have found that more than 165 million adults in 148 foreign countries
   would, if they could, move to the US, which is the most desired
   destination for migrants.^[37] Most immigrants who come to the United
   States come because of overpopulation in their home countries, better
   opportunities for employment, avoidance of political oppression, the
   opportunity to rejoin their loved ones, for the prospect of providing
   better lives for themselves and their children, and for the educational
   and medical services benefits.^[38]

Causes by region[edit]

   In general illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America come
   because of very high fertility rates arresting the countries' economic
   development and related economic problems, but also sometimes due to
   political oppression.^[38] From Asia, they come for economic reasons
   but some come involuntarily as indentured servants or sex slaves.^[38]
   From Sub-Saharan Africa, they come for economic activities and there is
   some chance of slave trade.^[38] From Eastern Europe, they come for
   economic activities and to rejoin family already in the United States.
   However, there are also some who come involuntarily who work in the sex
   industry.^[38] From the Middle East, they come for economic activities
   or to rejoin family already in the United States.

Overpopulation[edit]

   High fertility rates in some areas can cause overpopulation problems
   that force some of the population out of a country and to become
   illegal immigrants. Also, very large family size leaves children
   inadequately parented.

   In Mexico, for example, the average man or woman had 6.8 children in
   1970, while in the US fertility rates among non-Hispanics have been
   below 2.0 since 1970.

   Because developed countries are in a stage of declining fertility as
   they are transitioning to egalitarian marriage from patriarchal
   marriage, this can form a vacuum that encourages illegal
   immigration.^[39] When a developed country moves further through to
   having more egalitarian marriages, the fertility rate tends to rise
   back up and illegal immigration rates drop, however, this stage may be
   prevented if the (a) high fertility rates of illegal immigrants mask
   the issues in the developed country or (b) the value system of the
   immigrants prevents reform of the developed country's systems to end
   discrimination against egalitarian families.^[40]

Economic incentives[edit]

   The continuing practice of hiring unauthorized workers has been
   referred to as "the magnet for illegal immigration". As a significant
   percentage of employers are willing to hire illegal immigrants for
   higher pay than they would typically receive in their former country,
   illegal immigrants have prime motivation to cross borders.^[41]

   In 2003, then-President of Mexico, Vicente Fox stated that remittances
   "are our biggest source of foreign income, bigger than oil, tourism or
   foreign investment" and "the money transfers grew after Mexican
   consulates started giving identity cards to their citizens in the
   United States." He stated that money sent from Mexican workers in the
   United States to their families back home reached a record $12 billion
   in 2003.^[42] Two years later, in 2005, the World Bank stated that
   Mexico was receiving $18.1 billion in remittances and that it ranked
   third (behind only India and China) among the countries receiving the
   greatest amount of remittances.^[43]

   As shown in the section causes by regions, economic reasons is the most
   popular reason as to why people illegally immigrate to the United
   States. The United States is attractive for economic reasons because
   United States employers hire illegal immigrants at wages substantially
   higher than they could earn in their native countries.^[44] A study of
   illegal immigrants from Mexico in the 1978 harvest season in Oregon
   showed that they earned six times what they could have earned in
   Mexico, and even after deducting the costs of the seasonal migration
   and certain additional expenses for living in the United States, their
   net U.S. earnings were three times their Mexican alternative.^[45] It
   is also important to consider the higher availability of this type of
   job. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Mexico's high fertility rate caused
   a large increase in the population size. While the growth of the
   population has slowed in more recent times, the large numbers of people
   born in the 60s and 70s are now in prime working age looking for
   jobs.^[45]

   According to Judith Gans, Immigration Policy Program Manager at the
   University of Arizona, United States employers are pushed to hire
   illegal migrants for three main reasons - global economic change, the
   inadequacy of channels for legal economic migration, and ineffective
   employer sanctions.^[44] Global economic change is one cause for
   illegal immigration because information and transportation technologies
   now foster internationalized production, distribution and consumption,
   and labor. This has encouraged many countries to open their economies
   to outside investment, then increasing the number of low-skilled
   workers participating in global labor markets and making low-skilled
   labor markets all more competitive.^[44] This and the fact that
   developed countries have shifted from manufacturing to knowledge-based
   economies, have realigned economic activity around the world.^[44]
   Labor has become more international as individuals migrate seeking
   work, despite governmental attempts to control this migration.^[44]
   Because the United States education system creates relatively few
   people who either lack a high school diploma or who hold PhDs, there is
   a shortage of workers needed to fulfill seasonal low-skilled jobs as
   well as certain high-skilled jobs. To fill these gaps, the United
   States immigration system attempts to compensate for these shortages by
   providing for temporary immigration by farm workers and seasonal
   low-skilled workers, and for permanent immigration by high-skilled
   workers.^[44] The third cause of illegal immigration — the
   ineffectiveness of current employer sanctions for illegal hiring —
   allows migrants who are in the country illegally to easily find jobs.
   There are three reasons for this ineffectiveness - the absence of
   reliable mechanisms for verifying employment eligibility, inadequate
   funding of interior immigration enforcement, and the absence of
   political will due to labor needs to the United States economy.^[44]
   For example, it is unlawful to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant, but
   according to Judith Gans, there are no reliable mechanisms in place for
   employers to verify that the immigrants' papers are authentic.^[44]
   Evidence is accumulating that the number of illegal immigrants is
   diminishing because of increased border security and tougher
   immigration laws, and because there are fewer jobs in the American
   economy.^[38]

Channels for legal migration[edit]

   The United States immigration system provides channels for legal,
   permanent economic migration, especially for low-skilled workers.^[44]
   The United States immigration system rests on three pillars (family
   reunification, provision of scarce labor) as in agricultural and
   specific high-skilled worker sectors and protecting American workers
   from competition with foreign workers.^[44] The current system sets an
   overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit
   does not apply to spouses, unmarried minor children or parents of U.S.
   citizens.^[46] Outside of this number for permanent immigrants, 480,000
   visas are allotted for those under the family-preference rules and
   140,000 are allocated for employment-related preferences.^[46] The
   current system and low number of visas available, make it impossible
   for low-skilled workers to legally and permanently enter the country to
   work, so illegal entry becomes the way migrants respond to the lure of
   jobs with higher wages than what they would be able to find in their
   current country.^[44] Another reason for the large numbers of illegal
   immigrants present in the United States is the termination of the
   bracero program. This program existed from 1942 to 1964 to supply
   low-skilled Mexican workers to harvest fruits and vegetables in the
   United States. Many legal workers became illegal when this program
   ended because the change in law was not accompanied by a change in
   economic incentives for Mexican workers and the American growers.^[45]

Chain immigration[edit]

   [icon] This section requires expansion. (August 2008)

   According to demographer Jeffery Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center, the
   flow of Mexicans to the U. S. has produced a "network effect" -
   furthering immigration as Mexicans moved to join relatives already in
   the U.S.^[47] The Pew Hispanic Center describes that the recent
   dramatic increase in the population of illegal immigrants has sparked
   more illegal immigrants to cross borders. Once the extended families of
   illegal immigrants cross national borders, they create a "network
   effect" by building large communities.^[47]

   According to the Migration Policy Institute, increasing allowances for
   family members to immigrate to the US, and processing those
   applications faster, would reduce the number of illegal immigrants in
   the US.^[48]

Further Incentives[edit]

   Lower costs of transportation, communication and information has
   facilitated illegal migration. Mexican nationals, in particular, have a
   very low cost of migration and can easily cross the border. Even if it
   requires more than one attempt, they have a very low probability of
   being detected and then deported once they have entered the
   country.^[45]

Lobbying[edit]

   Several ethnic lobbies support immigration reforms that would allow
   current illegal immigrants to gain citizenship. They may also lobby for
   special arrangements for their own group. The Chairman for the Irish
   Lobby for Immigration Reform has stated, "the Irish Lobby will push for
   any special arrangement it can get — 'as will every other ethnic group
   in the country.'"^[49]^[50]

International controversies[edit]

Mexican federal and state government assistance[edit]

   The US Department of Homeland Security and some advocacy groups have
   criticized a program of the government of the state of Yucatán and that
   of a federal Mexican agency directed to Mexicans migrating to and
   residing in the United States. They claim that the assistance includes
   advice on how to get across the U.S. border illegally, where to find
   healthcare, enroll their children in public schools, and send money to
   Mexico. The Mexican federal government also issues identity cards to
   Mexicans living outside of Mexico.^[51]^[52]
     * In 2005 the government of Yucatán produced a handbook and DVD about
       the risks and implications of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The
       guide told immigrants where to find health care, how to get their
       kids into U.S. schools, and how to send money home. Officials in
       Yucatán said the guide is a necessity to save lives but some
       American groups accused the government of encouraging illegal
       immigration.^[53]

     * In 2005 the Mexican government was criticized for distributing a
       comic book which offers tips to illegal emigrants to the United
       States.^[54] That comic book recommends to illegal immigrants, once
       they have safely crossed the border, "Don't call attention to
       yourself.... Avoid loud parties. ... Don't become involved in
       fights." The Mexican government defends the guide as an attempt to
       save lives. "It's kind of like illegal immigration for dummies,"
       said the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies
       in Washington, Mark Krikorian. "Promoting safe illegal immigration
       is not the same as arguing against it". The comic book does state
       on its last page that the Mexican Government does not promote
       illegal crossing at all and only encourages visits to the US with
       all required documentation.^[54]

   Groups in favor of application and enforcement of current immigration
   law oppose Matrícula Consular ("Consular Registration"), an
   identification card issued by the Government of Mexico through its
   consulate offices. The purpose of the card is to demonstrate that the
   bearer is a Mexican national living outside of Mexico. Similar consular
   identification cards are the Guatemalan CID card and the Argentinian
   CID card as well as a number of other CID cards issued to citizens of
   Colombia, El Salvador, and Honduras.^[55] The document is accepted at
   financial institutions in many states and, in conjunction with an IRS
   Taxpayer Identification Number, allows illegal immigrants to open
   checking and saving accounts.^[56] In December 2008, Governor
   Schwarzenegger launched Bank on California which calls on California
   mayors to specifically encourage the use of the Mexican CID and
   Guatemalan CID card by banks and credit unions as a primary
   identification when opening an account.^[57]^[not in citation given]

Legal issues[edit]

Immigration laws[edit]

   Main articles: United States nationality law and List of United States
   immigration laws

   Immigrants can be classified as illegal for one of three reasons:
   entering without authorization or inspection, staying beyond the
   authorized period after legal entry, or violating the terms of legal
   entry.^[58]

   Section 1325 in Title 8 of the United States Code, "Improper entry of
   alien", provides for a fine, imprisonment, or both for any noncitizen
   who:^[59]

    1. enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place
       other than as designated by immigration agents, or
    2. eludes examination or inspection by immigration agents, or
    3. attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a
       willfully false or misleading representation or the willful
       concealment of a material fact.

   The maximum prison term is 6 months for the first offense and 2 years
   for any subsequent offense. In addition to the above criminal fines and
   penalties, civil fines may also be imposed.

   Arizona, which passed immigration enforcement law Arizona SB 1070 in
   April 2010, is currently the "toughest bill on illegal immigration" in
   the United States,^[60] and is being challenged by the Department of
   Justice as encroaching on powers reserved by the United States
   Constitution to the Federal Government.^[60] On July 28, 2010, United
   States district court judge Susan Bolton issued a preliminary
   injunction affecting the most controversial parts of the law, including
   the section that required police officers to check a person's
   immigration status after a person had been involved in another act or
   situation which resulted in police activity.^[61]

   The Mexican Constitution grants citizens freedom to travel. The
   Constitution stipulates also that the right to cross border migration
   is authorized only if other applicable laws and requirements are
   observed, and when certain prerequisites have been met.^[62]

Prevention[edit]

   Main article: United States–Mexico barrier

   In October 2008, Mexico agreed to deport Cubans using the country as an
   entry point to the US. Then-Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Pérez Roque
   said the Cuban-Mexican agreement would lead to "the immense majority of
   Cubans being repatriated".^[63]

Employment[edit]

   Illegal immigrants are generally not allowed to receive state or local
   public benefits, which includes professional licenses.^[64] However, in
   2013 the California State Legislature passed laws allowing undocumented
   immigrants to obtain professional licenses. On February 1, 2014 Sergio
   C. Garcia became the first undocumented immigrant to be admitted to the
   State Bar of California since 2008, when applicants were first required
   to list citizenship status on bar applications.^[65]

   Audits of employment records in 2009 at American Apparel, a prominent
   Los Angeles garment manufacturer, by the Immigration and Customs
   Enforcement (ICE) agency uncovered discrepancies in the documentation
   of about 25 percent of the company's workers. This technique of
   auditing employment records originated during the George W. Bush
   presidency and has been continued under President Obama. It may result
   in deportations should definite evidence of illegality be uncovered,
   but at American Apparel the audit resulted only in the termination of
   employees who could not resolve discrepancies. Most fired workers, some
   of whom had worked a decade at the plant, reported that they would seek
   other employment within the United States.

   This technique of enforcement is much less disruptive than mass raids
   at workplaces. The Obama administration has pointed out that they do
   not follow the Bush administration pattern of raids with a mass roundup
   of workers. That method had been criticized for disrupting businesses,
   and breaking up immigrant families. However, the chief executive of
   American Apparel said of the new policy: "No matter how we choose to
   define or label them, illegal immigrants are hard-working, taxpaying
   workers."^[66]

Apprehension[edit]

   US ICE, USBP, and CBP enforce the INA, and to some extent the United
   States military, local law enforcement and other local agencies, and
   private citizens and citizen groups guard the border.^[citation needed]

At border[edit]

   In December 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to build a
   barrier along parts of the border not already protected by barriers. A
   later vote in the United States Senate on May 17, 2006, included a plan
   to blockade 860 miles (1,380 km) of the border with vehicle barriers
   and triple-layer fencing along with granting an "earned path to
   citizenship" to the 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. and
   roughly doubling legal immigration (from their 1970s levels)^[citation
   needed] . In 2007 Congress approved a plan calling for more fencing
   along the Mexican border, with funds for approximately 700 miles
   (1,100 km) of new fencing.^[citation needed]

   "If immigrants, whether legal or illegal, are apprehended entering the
   US while committing a crime, they are usually charged under federal
   statutes and, if convicted, are sent to federal prisons."^[67]

At workplace[edit]

   For decades, immigration authorities have alerted
   ("no-match-letters")^[68] employers of mismatches between reported
   employees' Social Security cards and the actual names of the card
   holders. On September 1, 2007, a federal judge halted this practice of
   alerting employers of card mismatches.^[69]

   Illegal hiring has not been prosecuted aggressively in recent years:
   between 1999 and 2003, according to The Washington Post, "work-site
   enforcement operations were scaled back 95 percent by the Immigration
   and Naturalization Service.^[70] Major employers of illegal immigrants
   have included:
     * Wal-Mart. In 2005, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $11 million to settle a
       federal investigation that found hundreds of illegal immigrants
       were hired by Wal-Mart's cleaning contractors.^[71]

     * Swift & Co.: In December 2006, in the largest such crackdown in
       American history, U.S. federal immigration authorities raided Swift
       & Co. meat-processing plants in six U.S. states, arresting about
       1,300 illegal immigrant employees.^[72]

     * Tyson Foods. This company has also been accused of actively
       importing illegal labor for its chicken packing plants; however,
       the jury acquitted the company after evidence was presented that
       Tyson went beyond mandated government requirements in demanding
       documentation for its employees.^[73]

     * Gebbers Farms. In December 2009, US immigration authorities forced
       this Brewster, Washington farm known for its fruit orchards to fire
       more than 500 illegal workers, mostly immigrants from Mexico. Some
       were working with false social security cards and other false
       identification.^[74]

   Grande is the thin line separating the two cities through the middle of

Detention[edit]

   Main article: Immigration detention in the United States

   About 40% of illegal immigrants enter legally and then overstay.^[9]
   About 31,000 people who are not American citizens are held in
   immigration detention on any given day,^[75] including children, in
   over 200 detention centers, jails, and prisons nationwide.^[76] The
   United States government held more than 300,000 people in immigration
   detention in 2007 while deciding whether to deport them.^[77]

Deportation[edit]

   Deportations of immigrants, which are also referred to as removals, may
   be issued when immigrants are found to be in violation of the United
   States' immigration laws. Deportations may be imposed on a person who
   is neither native-born nor a naturalized citizen of the United
   States.^[78] Deportation proceedings are also referred to as removal
   proceedings and are typically initiated by the Department of Homeland
   Security. The United States issues deportations for various reasons
   which include security, protection of resources, and protection of
   jobs.

The AEDPA and IIRIRA Acts of 1996[edit]

   In 1996 there were two major pieces of legislation passed that had a
   significant effect on illegal immigration and most importantly
   deportations in the United States. The two new laws were the
   Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the Illegal
   Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). These two
   laws were introduced following the events of the World Trade Center
   bombing of 1993 and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, both of which
   were terrorist attacks that claimed American lives. These two acts
   resulted in a significant change in the process of convicting lawful
   permanent residents. Although deportation had always been a viable and
   practiced sentence, these new laws changed the way criminal cases of
   lawful permanent residents were handled which in turn resulted in an
   increased number of deportations from the United States.^[79] Before
   the 1996 deportation laws there were two steps that lawful permanent
   residents who were convicted of crimes had to go through. The first
   step was simply to determine whether or not the person was deportable.
   The second step reviewed the case to determine if that person should or
   shouldn't be deported. Before the 1996 deportation laws the second step
   prevented many permanent residents from being deported by allowing for
   their cases to be reviewed in full before issuing deportations.
   External factors were taken into consideration such as the effect
   deportation would have on a person's family members and a person's
   connections with their country of origin. Under this system permanent
   residents were able to be relieved of deportation if their situation
   deemed it unnecessary. The 1996 laws however issued many deportations
   under the first step without ever arriving at the second step resulting
   in a great increase in the likelihood and frequency of permanent
   residents being subjected to deportation. One significant change that
   resulted from the new laws was the definition of the term aggravated
   felony. Being convicted of a crime that is categorized as an aggravated
   felony results in mandatory detention and deportation. The new
   definition of aggravated felony includes simple convictions like
   shoplifting that would not be considered anything more than a
   misdemeanor in a lot of states. The new laws have categorized a much
   wider range of crimes under the term aggravated felony. The effect of
   this has been a large increase in permanent residents facing mandatory
   deportation from the United States without the opportunity to plea for
   relief. The 1996 deportation laws have received a lot of criticism for
   their curtailing of permanent resident's rights.^[79]

The USA Patriot Act[edit]

   The USA Patriot Act was passed seven weeks after the terrorist attacks
   of September 11, 2001. The purpose of the act was to give the
   government more power to act against suspicious terrorist activity. The
   new governmental powers granted by this act included significant
   expansion in surveillance as well as a significant expansion in the
   range of conditions in which illegal immigrants could be deported from
   the United States based on suspicion of terrorist activity. The USA
   Patriot Act had a direct effect on deportations of immigrants from the
   United States. The new act gave the government the power to deport
   individuals based not on plots or acts of terrorism but simply on
   affiliations with certain organizations. The Secretary of State
   designated specific organizations foreign terrorist organizations
   before the USA Patriot Act was implemented. Organizations on this list
   were deemed dangerous because they were actively involved in terrorist
   activity that threatened United States national security. The USA
   Patriot Act created a type of organization deemed designated
   organizations. The Secretary of State and Attorney General were given
   the power to designate any organization that supported terrorist
   activity on any level. The act also allows for penalization of an
   individual's involvement in undesignated organizations that were still
   deemed suspicious. ^[80]

   Under the USA Patriot Act the Attorney General was granted the power to
   "certify" illegal immigrants based on the grounds that they pose a
   threat to national security. Once an illegal immigrant is certified
   they must be taken into custody and face mandatory detention which will
   result in a criminal charge or release. The USA Patriot Act has been
   criticized for violating the Fifth Amendment's right to due process.
   Under the USA Patriot Act an illegal immigrant is not granted the
   opportunity for a hearing before given certification. It is criticized
   in general for allowing mandatory detention of illegal immigrants on
   inadequate grounds. ^[81]

Complications[edit]

   Complications in deportation efforts ensue when parents are illegal
   immigrants but their children are birthright citizens. Federal
   appellate courts have upheld the refusal by the Immigration and
   Naturalization Service to stay the deportation of illegal immigrants
   merely on the grounds that they have U.S.-citizen, minor children.^[82]
   There are some 3.1 million United States citizen children with at least
   one illegal immigrant parent as of 2005; at least 13,000 American
   children had one or both parents deported in the years 2005–2007.^[83]

   Such was the case of Mexican Elvira Arellano, who had a child while in
   the U.S. illegally and later sought sanctuary at a Chicago-area church
   in an effort to evade a deportation order.^[84] This was also the case
   in the instance of Sadia Umanzor, a fugitive from a 2006 deportation
   order who failed to appear in court after her arrest for illegally
   crossing into the U.S.^[84] Deportations from the United States
   increased by more than 60 percent from 2003 to 2008, with Mexicans
   accounting for nearly two-thirds of those deported.^[85]^[not in
   citation given] Under the Obama administration, deportations have
   increased to record levels beyond the level reached by the George W.
   Bush administration with a projected 400,000 deportations in 2010, 10
   percent above the deportation rate of 2008 and 25 percent above
   2007.^[86] Fiscal year 2011 saw 396,906 deportations, the largest
   number in the history of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; of
   those, 216,698 had been convicted of crimes, including:^[87]
     * 44,653 convicted of "drug-related crimes"
     * 35,927 convicted of driving under the influence
     * 5,848 convicted of sexual offenses
     * 1,119 convicted of homicide

   By the end of 2012, as many people had been deported during the first
   four years of the Obama presidency as were deported during the
   eight-year presidency of George W. Bush.^[88]

Dream Act[edit]

   The Act was intended to stop the deportation of people who had arrived
   as children and had grown up in the US. The Act would give lawful
   permanent residency under certain conditions which include: good moral
   character, enrollment in a secondary or post-secondary education
   program, and having lived in the United States at least 5 years. Those
   in opposition of the DREAM Act believe that it encourages illegal
   immigration.^[89]

Deportation Trends[edit]

   A direct effect of the deportation laws of 1996 and the USA Patriot Act
   has been a dramatic increase in deportations. Prior to these acts
   deportations had remained at about an average of 20,000 per year.
   Between 1990 and 1995 deportations had increased to about an average of
   40,000 a year. From 1996 to 2005 the yearly average had increased to
   over 180,000. In the year 2005 the number of deportations reached
   208,521 with less than half being deported under criminal grounds.^[90]
   According to a June 2013 report published by the Washington Office on
   Latin America, dangerous deportation practices are on the rise and pose
   a serious threat to the safety of the migrants being deported. These
   practices include repatriating migrants to border cities with high
   levels of drug-related violence and criminal activity, night
   deportations (approximately 1 in 5 migrants reports being deported
   between the hours of 10pm and 5am), and "lateral repatriations", or the
   practice of moving migrants from the region where they were detained to
   areas hundreds of miles away.^[91] These practices increase the risk of
   gangs and organized criminal groups preying upon the newly arrived
   migrants.

   According to survey by the Associated Press conducted in August 2014,
   The Homeland Security Department was on pace to remove the fewest
   number of immigrants since 2007. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
   the federal agency responsible for deportations, sent home 258,608
   immigrants between the start of the budget year - Oct. 1, 2013. and
   July 28, 2014 - a decrease of nearly 20 percent from the same period in
   2013, when 320,167 people were removed. Obama announced earlier in 2014
   plans to slow down deportations; recently these have been put on hold
   until the upcoming election in November.^[92]

Mass deportation[edit]

   According to The Washington Post,^[93] Rajeev K. Goyle, of the Center
   for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank, says he
   conducted a study to respond to officials who have advocated mass
   deportations. This study claims that the cost of forcibly removing most
   of the nation's estimated 10 million illegal immigrants is $41 billion
   a year. A spokesman for Rep. Tom Tancredo calls the study "useless"
   because no one's talking about employing mass deportation as a tactic.
   Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration
   Studies, describes the study as a cartoon version of how enforcement
   would work.

   There have been two major periods of mass deportations in U.S. history.
   In the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s, through mass deportations and
   forced migration, an estimated 500,000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans
   were deported or coerced into emigrating, in what Mae Ngai, an
   immigration history expert at the University of Chicago, has described
   as "a racial removal program".^[94] The majority of those removed were
   U.S. Citizens.^[94] Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., cosponsor of a U.S.
   House Bill that calls for a commission to study the "deportation and
   coerced emigration" of U.S. citizens and legal residents, has expressed
   concerns that history could repeat itself, and that should illegal
   immigration be made into a felony, this could prompt a "massive
   deportation of U.S. citizens".^[94] Later, in Operation Wetback in
   1954, when the United States last deported a sizable number of illegal
   immigrants, in some cases along with their U.S. born children (who are
   citizens according to U.S. law),^[95] some illegal immigrants, fearful
   of potential violence as police swarmed through Mexican American
   barrios throughout the southeastern states, stopping "Mexican-looking"
   citizens on the street and asking for identification, fled to
   Mexico.^[95]

Police and military involvement[edit]

   In 1995, the United States Congress considered an exemption from the
   Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits direct participation of
   Department of Defense personnel in civilian law enforcement activities,
   such as search, seizure, and arrests.^[96]

   In 1997, Marines shot and killed 18 year old U.S. citizen Esequiel
   Hernández Jr^[97] while on a mission to interdict smuggling and illegal
   immigration near the border community of Redford, Texas. The Marines
   observed the high school student from concealment while he was tending
   his family's goats in the vicinity of their ranch. At one point,
   Hernandez raised his .22-caliber rifle and fired shots in the direction
   of the concealed soldiers. He was subsequently tracked for 20 minutes
   then shot and killed.^[98]^[99] In reference to the incident, military
   lawyer Craig T. Trebilcock argues, "the fact that armed military troops
   were placed in a position with the mere possibility that they would
   have to use force to subdue civilian criminal activity reflects a
   significant policy shift by the executive branch away from the posse
   comitatus doctrine."^[100] The killing of Hernandez led to a
   congressional review^[101] and an end to a nine-year old policy of the
   military aiding the Border Patrol.^[102]

   After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United States again
   considered placing soldiers along the U.S.-Mexico border as a security
   measure.^[103] In May 2006, President George W. Bush announced plans to
   use the National Guard to strengthen enforcement of the US-Mexico
   Border from illegal immigrants,^[104] emphasizing that Guard units
   "will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities".^[105]
   Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez said in an interview with
   a Mexico City radio station, "If we see the National Guard starting to
   directly participate in detaining people ... we would immediately start
   filing lawsuits through our consulates."^[106] The American Civil
   Liberties Union (ACLU) called on the President 245 not to deploy
   military troops to deter illegal immigrants, and stated that a
   "deployment of National Guard troops violates the spirit of the Posse
   Comitatus Act".^[107] According to the State of the Union address in
   January 2007,^[108] more than 6000 National Guard members have been
   sent to the US-Mexico border to supplement the Border Patrol,^[109]
   costing in excess of $750 million.^[110]

Sanctuary cities[edit]

   Main article: Sanctuary city

   Several US cities have instructed their own law enforcement personnel
   and other city employees not to notify or cooperate with the federal
   government when they become aware of illegal immigrants living within
   their jurisdiction.

   Many cities, including Washington, D.C.; New York City NYC; Los
   Angeles; Chicago; San Francisco;^[111] San Diego; Austin; Salt Lake
   City; Dallas; Detroit; Honolulu; Houston; Jersey City; Minneapolis;
   Miami; Denver; Aurora, Colorado; Baltimore; Seattle; Portland, Oregon;
   Portland, Maine; and Senath, Missouri, have become "sanctuary cities",
   having adopted ordinances refraining from stopping or questioning
   individuals for the sole purpose of determining their immigration
   status.^[112]

   Most of these cities claim that the benefit illegal immigrants bring to
   their city outweigh the costs.^[not in citation given] Opponents say
   the measures violate federal law as the cities are in effect creating
   their own immigration policy, an area of law which only Congress has
   authority to alter.^[113]

   However scholars have tagged these so-called "don't tell" measures as
   "obvious targets for express preemption" given the apparent conflict
   between "don't tell" policies and the restrictions in Sections 434 of
   the "Welfare Reform Act" and Section 642 of the "Immigration Reform
   Act" that expressly forbid restraints on communications with federal
   officials, including the sharing of information relating to people's
   illegal immigration status.

Community-based involvement[edit]

   According to a 2006 report by the Anti-Defamation League, white
   supremacists and other extremists were engaging in a growing number of
   assaults against legal and illegal immigrants and those perceived to be
   immigrants.^[114]

   The No More Deaths organization offers food, water, and medical aid to
   migrants crossing the desert regions of the American Southwest in an
   effort to reduce the increasing number of deaths along the
   border.^[115]

Impacts[edit]

Economic[edit]

   Main article: Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United
   States

Wages and employment[edit]

   George J. Borjas, an economist at Harvard University, has argued that
   illegal immigration may reduce the economic status of U.S. poor while
   benefiting middle class individuals and wealthier
   Americans.^[116]^[verification needed] The presence of illegal
   immigrants and the exploitation of them may drive down wages for
   certain sectors of the American populace, further widening the
   socioeconomic gulf between rich and poor.^[117] Professor emeritus
   Stephen J. Unger from the University of Columbia, explains that this
   results from employers who hire illegal immigrants that are exploited
   or willing to work for lower wages, instead of raising wages to attract
   legal citizens. Thusly, wages are kept flat or depressed and the
   employment rates for legal U.S. citizens decrease at the same
   time.^[118] Additionally, illegal immigrants may displace work
   opportunities that would otherwise be available to citizens, thereby
   inducing native-born citizens to commit crimes.^[119]

   Research by Borjas, Jeffrey Grogger, and Gordon H. Hanson suggests that
   a 10-percent immigrant-induced increase in the supply of a particular
   skill group reduced the black wage by 4.0 percent, lowered the
   employment rate of black men by 3.5 percentage points, and increased
   the incarceration rate of blacks by almost one percent.^[120]

   In a 2002 study of the effects of illegal immigration and border
   enforcement on wages in border communities from 1990 to 1997, conducted
   by Gordon H. Hanson, Raymond Robertson, and Antonio Spilimbergo, the
   researchers concluded that their findings were consistent with the
   hypothesis, "immigration from Mexico has a minimal impact on wages in
   U.S. border cities".^[121] The group also concluded that their findings
   suggest that concerns about the impact of illegal immigration on border
   communities have been exaggerated, and that border enforcement did not
   appear to affect wages in border communities.^[121]

Consumer demand[edit]

   Reverse migration of illegal immigrants from the US back to Mexico has
   reduced consumer demand in the United States due to an overall decline
   in the population.^[122]^[123]^[124]^[125]^[126]^[not in citation
   given] According to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies,
   analysis of US Census data suggests that between 2005 and 2008, most of
   the reduction in less-educated, young Hispanic immigrants is due to
   illegal immigrants leaving on their own.^[127]

Taxes and social services[edit]

   Illegal immigrants are estimated to pay in about $7 billion per year
   into Social Security.^[128]

   A paper in the peer reviewed Tax Lawyer journal from the American Bar
   Association asserts that illegal immigrants contribute more in taxes
   than they cost in social services.^[129] However, The nonpartisan
   Congressional Budget Office reviewed 29 reports published over 15 years
   to evaluate the impact of illegal immigrants on the budgets of state
   and local governments, and found that the tax revenues that illegal
   immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the
   total cost of services provided to those immigrants, though the report
   speculated that the impact of illegal immigrants on state and local
   budgets was likely to be modest.^[130]

Mortgages[edit]

   Around 2005, an increasing number of banks saw illegal immigrants as an
   untapped resource for growing their own revenue stream and contended
   that providing illegal immigrants with mortgages would help revitalize
   local communities, with many community banks providing home loans for
   illegal immigrants. At the time, critics complained that this practice
   would reward and encourage illegal immigration, as well as contribute
   to an increase in predatory lending practices. One banking consultant
   said that banks which were planning to offer mortgages to illegal
   immigrants were counting on the fact that immigration enforcement was
   very lax, with deportation unlikely for anyone who had not committed a
   crime.^[131]

Law enforcement expenses[edit]

Apprehension & deportation[edit]

   Border control uses the latest technology to help capture illegal
   immigrants in the process of crossing, sometimes detain/prosecute, and
   send them back over the border. According to the US Department of
   Homeland Security and the Border Patrol Enforcement Integrated
   Database, apprehensions have increased from 955,310 in 2002 to
   1,159,802 in 2004. "But fewer than 4 percent of apprehended migrants
   were actually detained and prosecuted for illegal entry, partly because
   it costs $90 a day to keep them in detention facilities and bed space
   is very limited. For the remainder of the apprehended migrants, if they
   are willing to sign a form attesting that they are voluntarily
   repatriating themselves, they are simply bussed to a gate on the
   border, where they re-enter Mexico."^[132]^[verification needed]
   "During the summer of 2004, the U.S. government pressured the Mexican
   government into accepting 'deep repatriation' of as many as 300
   apprehended migrants per day to six cities in central and southern
   Mexico.

Public Health Preparedness and Emergency Management[edit]

   The increasing number of illegal immigrants living within the borders
   of the United States has also placed an increased strain on the Public
   Health Preparedness and Emergency Management systems. It is impossible
   for organizations within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to
   accurately prepare for a disaster if a significant portion of the
   affected area’s population is undocumented, and therefore unaccounted
   for. One organization in particular, the Federal Emergency Management
   Agency, (FEMA) has had numerous issues when dealing with unexpected
   increases in the number of people requesting assistance. The
   appropriate amount of funding, resources, and manpower is based on the
   population in an area. Adequate care will not be dispatched due to the
   growing number of illegal immigrants living in a disaster area.
   Essentially, relief service agencies must be accountable for people who
   are theoretically not there. It is essential for public health
   preparedness and emergency management personnel, to have an accurate
   depiction of the number of people that will require assistance
   following an emergency. Illegal immigrants make this task much more
   difficult and burdensome than necessary.

   Illegal immigrants who do not have a basic understanding of the English
   language exacerbate the problem further. Because of this break in
   communication, many people will not be aware of where to receive aid,
   how to secure assistance, if and when to evacuate, or even the fact
   that they may be in immediate danger. “Failures in communication not
   only endanger limited English proficient individuals and their families
   but also threaten to put into harm’s way first responders tasked with
   rescuing people”. Difficulties in the past include, “connecting victims
   and evacuees with major disaster relief providers due to the providers’
   lack of linguistically and culturally competent staff; difficulties
   securing adequate funding for disaster relief operations; poor
   communication with FEMA, Red Cross, and other major disaster relief
   providers”.^[133]

   Furthering complications is the fact that most illegal immigrants have
   an innate distrust of the American government, or simply fear
   retribution from being identified as being an illegal immigrant
   residing in America. This is despite the fact that noncash emergency
   assistance is mandated, by law, to be given to victims of a disaster
   regardless of citizenship by FEMA. Illegal immigrants without
   documentation also cause problems in regards to the distribution of
   assistance to victims. It would be nearly impossible, aside from using
   biometrics, to determine which illegal immigrant has and has not
   received assistance. These undocumented people may repeatedly go and
   take more assistance than what is needed thus making it more difficult
   for others in need to receive assistance. Unless a trust can be built
   between the government and illegal immigrants, “future disasters could
   result in grave human tragedy, public health catastrophes, and national
   embarrassment, particularly if the disaster is a pandemic or
   bioterrorism attack”.^[134]

   As a result of the increasing number of people in the United States who
   do not speak English, several laws and bills have been established in
   order to ensure their safety. Although many of these laws were
   established for legal citizens who speak little or no English, much of
   what they discuss now applies to illegal immigrants. In 2000, The White
   House issued Presidential Executive Order 13166, “which requires that
   federal agencies work to ensure that federally funded programs provide
   meaningful access to limited English proficient applicants and
   beneficiaries. It also directs federal agencies to examine the services
   they conduct, identify any need for services among those with limited
   English proficiency, and develop and implement a plan to provide those
   services to ensure that limited English proficient persons have
   meaningful access to them”.^[134]

Crimes committed by illegal immigrants[edit]

   California has the largest immigrant population in the US, and
   immigrants (combined total of legal and illegal) are under represented
   among California prison inmates.^[119] The most recent research
   indicates approximately 35% of the California population consists of
   immigrants, while immigrants represent 17% of the prison population. In
   fact, U.S. born adult men are incarcerated at a rate over
   two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men.^[119]
   However, this does not separate the illegal versus legal immigrants.

   Illegal immigrants avoid involvement in criminal activity to reduce
   interaction with law enforcement officials, and according to Tim
   Wadsworth, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of
   Colorado at Boulder, "[t]he suggestion that high levels of immigration
   may have been partially responsible for the drop in crime during the
   1990s seems plausible."^[135]

   According to Edmonton and Smith in The New Americans: Economic,
   Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration, "it is difficult to
   draw any strong conclusions on the association between immigration and
   crime".^[67] Cities with large immigrant populations showed larger
   reductions in property and violent crime than cities without large
   immigrant populations.^[136] Almost all of what is known about
   immigration and crime is from information on those in prison.
   Incarceration rates do not necessarily reflect differences in current
   crime rates.^[67]

   The Center for Immigration Studies in a 2009 report argued, "New
   government data indicate that immigrants have high rates of
   criminality, while older academic research found low rates. The overall
   picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good
   data and contrary information." It also criticized reports using data
   from the 2000 Census according to which 4% of prisoners were
   immigrants. Non-citizens often have a strong incentive to deny this in
   order to prevent deportation and there are also other problems. Some
   better but still uncertain methods have found that 20-22% of prisoners
   were immigrants. It also criticized studies looking at percentages of
   immigrants in a city and crime for only looking at overall crime and
   not immigrant crime as well as having other possible problems.^[137]

   As of 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE)
   under its "Secure Communities" project has identified 240,000 illegal
   immigrants convicted of crimes, according to Department of Homeland
   Security figures. Of those, about 30,000 have been deported, including
   8,600 convicted of what the agency calls "the most egregious
   offenses.^[138]

   A few of the other reasons also cited for why the extent of illegal
   immigrants' criminal activities is unknown are as follows:
     * For many minor crimes, especially crimes involving juveniles, those
       who are apprehended are not arrested. Only a fraction of those who
       are arrested are ever brought to the courts for disposition.^[67]

     * Many illegal immigrants who are apprehended by Border Patrol agents
       are voluntarily returned to their home countries and are not
       ordinarily tabulated in national crime statistics. If immigrants,
       whether illegal or legal, are apprehended entering the United
       States while committing a crime, they are usually charged under
       federal statutes and, if convicted, are sent to federal prisons.
       Throughout this entire process, immigrants may have a chance of
       deportation, or of sentencing that is different from that for a
       native-born person.^[67]

     * We lack comprehensive information on whether arrested or jailed
       immigrants are illegal immigrants, nonimmigrants, or legal
       immigrants. Such information can be difficult to collect because
       immigrants may have a reason to provide false statements (if they
       reply that they are an illegal immigrant, they can be deported, for
       instance). The verification of the data is troublesome because it
       requires matching INS records with individuals who often lack
       documentation or present false documents.^[67]

     * Noncitizens may have had fewer years residing in the United States
       than citizens, and thus less time in which to commit crimes and be
       apprehended.^[67]

   In 1999, law enforcement activities involving illegal immigrants in
   California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas cost a combined total of
   more than $108 million. This cost did not include activities related to
   border enforcement. In San Diego County, the expense (over $50 million)
   was nine percent of the total county's budget for law enforcement that
   year.^[139]

   A study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has found that
   while property-related crime rates have not been affected by increased
   immigration (both legal and illegal), in border counties there is a
   significant positive correlation between illegal immigration and
   violent crime, most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along
   the border.^[140]

   On August 6, 2008, an audit done by agents of Immigration and Customs
   Enforcement found that 122 of the 637 jail inmates in the Lake County,
   Illinois, jail were of questionable immigration status. Of those 122
   originally suspected, 75 were later ordered to face deportation
   proceedings by the ICE. According to Lake County sheriff Mark Curran,
   illegal immigrants were charged with half of the 14 murders in the
   county.^[141]

   The Arizona Department of Corrections reported in 2010 that illegal
   immigrants are over-represented in the state's prison population. In
   June 2010, illegal immigrants represented 14.8 percent of Arizona state
   prisoners, but accounted for 7 percent of the state's overall
   population according to the Department of Homeland Security. In
   addition, the data showed that illegal immigrants accounted for 40% of
   all the prisoners serving time in Arizona state prisons for kidnapping;
   24% of those serving time for drug charges; and 13 percent of those
   serving time for murder.^[142]

   A US Justice Department report from 2009 indicated that one of the
   largest street gangs in the United States, Los Angeles-based 18th
   Street gang, has a membership of some 30,000 to 50,000 with 80% of them
   being illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Active in 44
   cities in 20 states, its main source of income is street-level
   distribution of cocaine and marijuana and, to a lesser extent, heroin
   and methamphetamine. Gang members also commit assault, auto theft,
   carjacking, drive-by shootings, extortion, homicide, identification
   fraud, and robbery.^[143]

   Another prominent street gang, Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS 13,
   with a membership of some 8,000 to 10,000 members in the US, is
   estimated to be predominantly composed of illegal immigrants (with some
   reporting up to 90%).^[144]^[145] MS-13 members smuggle illicit drugs,
   primarily powder cocaine and marijuana, into the US and transport and
   distribute the drugs throughout the country. Some members also are
   involved in alien smuggling, assault, drive-by shootings, homicide,
   identity theft, prostitution operations, robbery, and weapons
   trafficking.^[143] With over 3,000 members in Northern Virginia alone
   making it the largest gang in the region,^[146] MS-13 has been targeted
   by the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force which reports that
   40% of arrests from 2003-2008 were of illegal immigrants.^[145]^[147]
   It is also reported that 71% of the U.S. Immigration and Customs
   Enforcement (ICE) gang arrestees under "Operation Community Shield" in
   Northern Virginia from February 2005 to September 2007, were of EWI
   "Enter Without Inspection" status.^[145]

Identity theft[edit]

   Identity theft is sometimes committed by illegal immigrants who use
   social security numbers belonging to others, in order to obtain fake
   work documentation.^[citation needed] However, the US Supreme Court has
   ruled that illegal immigrants cannot be prosecuted for identity theft
   if they use "made-up" social security numbers that they do not know
   belong to someone else; to be guilty of identity theft with regard to
   social security numbers, they must know that the social security
   numbers that they use belong to others.^[citation needed]

Drug trafficking[edit]

   According to proceedings from a 1997 meeting of the House Judiciary
   Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, "Through other violations of
   our immigration laws, Mexican drug cartels are able to extend their
   command and control into the United States. Drug smuggling fosters,
   subsidizes, and is dependent upon continued illegal immigration and
   alien smuggling."^[148]

   Drug cartels have been reported using illegal immigrants, sometimes
   armed, to cultivate marijuana within American National Forests, in
   California's Los Padres National Forest,^[149]^[150] Tahoe National
   Forest,^[151] Six Rivers National Forest,^[152] and Sequoia National
   Forest,^[153] as well as in Arizona,^[154] Oregon,^[155] and
   Colorado.^[156]

Gang violence[edit]

   See also: 2010 Tamaulipas massacre and Los Zetas

   As of 2005, Operation Community Shield had detained nearly fourteen
   hundred illegal immigrant gang members.^[157]

   Members from the Salvadoran gang MS-13 are believed by authorities to
   have established a smuggling ring in Matamoros, Mexico. This smuggling
   involved transporting illegal immigrants from foreign countries into
   the United States. MS-13 has shown extreme violence against Border
   Patrol security to "teach them a lesson".^[158] "Mexican alien
   smugglers plan to pay violent gang members and smuggle them and drugs
   into the United States to murder Border Patrol agents, according to a
   confidential Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the Daily
   Bulletin."^[159]

Environment[edit]

   Waves of illegal immigrants are taking a heavy toll on U.S. public
   lands along the Mexican border, federal officials say.^[160] Mike
   Coffeen, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Tucson,
   Arizona found the level of impact to be shocking.^[160] "Environmental
   degradation has become among the migration trend's most visible
   consequences, a few years ago, there were 45 abandoned cars on the
   Buenos Aires refuge near Sasabe, Arizona and enough trash that a
   volunteer couple filled 723 large bags with 18,000 pounds of garbage
   over two months in 2002."^[161]

   "It has been estimated that the average desert-walking immigrant leaves
   behind 8 pounds of trash during a journey that lasts one to three days
   if no major incidents occur. Assuming half a million people cross the
   border illegally into Arizona annually, that translates to 2,000 tons
   of trash that migrants dump each year."^[162]

   Illegal immigrants trying to get to the United States via the Mexican
   border with southern Arizona are suspected of having caused eight major
   wildfires in 2002. The fires destroyed 68,413 acres (276.86 km^2) and
   cost taxpayers $5.1 million to fight.^[163]

National security and terrorism[edit]

   Mohamed Atta and two of his co-conspirators had expired visas when they
   executed the September 11 attacks. All of the attackers had U.S.
   government issued documents and two of them were erroneously granted
   visa extensions after their deaths.^[164] The National Commission on
   Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States found that the government
   inadequately tracked those with expired tourist or student visas.

   Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank that
   promotes immigration reduction, testified in a hearing before the House
   of Representatives,

     out of the 48 al-Qaeda operatives who committed crimes here between
     1993 and 2001, 12 of them were illegal immigrants when they
     committed their crimes, seven of them were visa overstayers,
     including two of the conspirators in the first World Trade Center
     attack, one of the figures from the New York subway bomb plot, and
     four of the 9/11 terrorists. In fact, even a couple other terrorists
     who were not illegal when they committed their crimes had been visa
     overstayers earlier and had either applied for asylum or finagled a
     fake marriage to launder their status.^[165]

   Vice Chair Lee H. Hamilton and Commissioner Slade Gorton of the
   National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States has
   stated that of the nineteen hijackers of the September 11, 2001
   attacks, "Two hijackers could have been denied admission at the port on
   entry based on violations of immigration rules governing terms of
   admission. Three hijackers violated the immigration laws after entry,
   one by failing to enroll in school as declared, and two by overstays of
   their terms of admission."^[166] Six months after the attack, their
   flight schools received posthumous visa approval letters from the
   Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for two of the hijackers,
   which made it clear that actual approval of the visas took place before
   the September 11 attacks.^[167]

   Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, illegal immigrants within the
   United States have attempted to carry out other terrorist attacks as
   well. Three of the six conspirators in the 2007 Fort Dix attack
   plot—Dritan Duka, Shain Duka, and Eljvir Duka—were ethnic Albanians
   from the Republic of Macedonia who entered the United States illegally
   through Mexico with their parents in 1984. Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, an
   illegal immigrant from Jordan who remained in the United States after
   the expiration of his tourist visa, was arrested in September 2009 for
   attempting to carry out a car bomb attack against Fountain Place in
   Dallas.

Harm to illegal immigrants[edit]

   There are significant dangers associated with illegal immigration
   including potential death when crossing the border. According to
   Chicano activist Roberto Martinez, since the 1994 implementation of an
   immigration-control effort called Operation Gatekeeper, immigrants have
   attempted to cross the border in more dangerous locations.^[168] Those
   crossing the border come unprepared, without food, water, proper
   clothing, or protection from the elements or dangerous animals;
   sometimes the immigrants are abandoned by those smuggling them.^[168]
   Deaths also occur while resisting arrest. In May 2010, the National
   Human Rights Commission in Mexico accused Border Patrol agents of
   tasering illegal immigrant Anastasio Hernández-Rojas to death. Media
   reports that Hernández-Rojas started a physical altercation with patrol
   agents and later autopsy findings concluded that the suspect had trace
   amounts of methampehatine in his blood levels which contributed to his
   death.^[169]^[170] The killing of Anastasio Hernández-Rojas was the
   subject of extensive media coverage in April, 2012 by PBS "Need to
   Know"^[171] and Democracy Now!^[172] The foreign ministry in Mexico
   City has demanded an explanation from San Diego and federal
   authorities, according to Tijuana newspapers.^[169] According to the US
   Border Agency, there were 987 assaults on US Border Agents in 2008 and
   there were a total of 12 people killed by agents in 2007 and
   2008.^[173]

   According to the Washington Office on Latin America's Border Fact Check
   site, Border Patrol rarely investigates allegations of abuse against
   migrants, and advocacy organizations say, "even serious incidents such
   as the shootings of migrants result in administrative, not criminal,
   investigations and sanctions."^[174]

Slavery[edit]

   Indian, Russian, Thai, and Chinese women have been reportedly brought
   to the United States under false pretenses. "As many as 50,000 people
   are illicitly trafficked into the United States annually, according to
   a 1999 CIA study. Once here, they're forced to work as prostitutes,
   sweatshop laborers, farmhands, and servants in private homes." US
   authorities call it "a modern form of slavery".^[175]^[176] Many Latina
   women have been lured under false pretenses to illegally come to the
   United States and are instead forced to work as prostitutes catering to
   the immigrant population. Non-citizen customers without proper
   documentation that have been detained in prostitution stings are
   generally deported.^[177]

Prostitution[edit]

   The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women has reported scores of cases
   where women were forced to prostitute themselves. "Trafficking in women
   plagues the United States as much as it does underdeveloped nations.
   Organized prostitution networks have migrated from metropolitan areas
   to small cities and suburbs. Women trafficked to the United States have
   been forced to have sex with 400-500 men to pay off $40,000 in debt for
   their passage." ^[178] At least 45,000 Central American children
   attempt to illegally immigrate to the United States every year and many
   of them finish in brothels as sex slaves, according to Manuel Capellin,
   director in Honduras of the humanitarian organization House
   Alliance.^[179] In the United States, women, who immigrate illegally,
   are often forced into sexual slavery.^[180]^[181]^[182]

Death[edit]

   See also: Haitian diaspora § Deaths

   Death by exposure has been reported in the deserts, particularly during
   the hot summer season.^[183] "Exposure to the elements" encompasses
   hypothermia, dehydration, heat strokes, drowning, and suffocation.
   Also, illegal immigrants may die or be injured when they attempt to
   avoid law enforcement. Martinez points out that engaging in high speed
   pursuits while attempting to escape arrest can lead to death.^[184]
   Many migrants are also killed or maimed riding the roofs of cargo
   trains in Mexico.^[185]

Cultural[edit]

   Harvard political scientist and historian Samuel P. Huntington argues
   in Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity that
   illegal immigration, primarily from Mexico, threatens to divide the
   United States culturally, into an Anglo-Protestant north, central, and
   eastern portion, and a Catholic-Hispanic southwest.

   Immigration researcher Andrea Nill has a similar point. Nill noted that
   the association of illegal immigration with Latinos would bring adverse
   attention to their community.^[186] Recent immigration laws could help
   fuel these associations and possibly encourage citizens to discriminate
   and distance themselves from the Hispanic culture.^[186] Furthermore,
   this separation could allow for tensions and possibly violence to grow
   between both groups.^[186]

Public opinion and controversy[edit]

US economy[edit]

   One of the most important factors regarding public opinion about
   illegal immigration, is the level of unemployment; anti-illegal
   immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and
   vice-versa.^[187] In general, some say that illegal immigrants are
   taking away jobs from Americans; however businesses and agricultural
   groups disagree and say that migrant workers are needed to fill
   unattractive jobs.^[46] This is further supported by a May 2006 New
   York Times/CBS News Poll report that 53 percent of Americans felt
   "illegal immigrants mostly take the jobs Americans don't want".^[188]
   However there are others who say that illegal immigration helps to
   "decimate the bargaining leverage of the American worker. If you use a
   form of labor recruitment that bids down the cost of labor, that leads
   you to a society where a small number are very, very rich, there's
   nobody in the middle, and everyone is left scrambling for crumbs at the
   bottom.^[46] Yet there are still others who say that the U.S. "has an
   economy that depends on illegal immigration" and "without illegal
   immigration labor, it would almost certainly not be possible to produce
   the same volume of food in the country."^[46]

Opinions from influential groups in society[edit]

Investors[edit]

   According to a 2006 Gallup poll, 84% of investors believe that illegal
   immigrants mostly take low paying jobs that Americans do not
   want.^[189] However, nearly 62% of investors say illegal immigration is
   hurting the investment climate.^[189] 68% of investors say that illegal
   immigrants cost taxpayers too much because they use government services
   like public education and medical services, while 25% say that in the
   long run, illegal immigrants become productive citizens who come to
   make up paying their fair share of taxes. About 80% thought that the
   government should do more to curb illegal immigration.^[189]

Crime[edit]

   The highly publicized murder of Arizona rancher Rob Krentz in March
   2010, suspected to have been committed by an illegal immigrant,^[190]
   provided a strong rallying cry for immigration opponents and called
   public attention to other crimes— notably property crimes— committed by
   foreign nationals during their border crossings into the U.S. Krentz
   had previously reported that illegal immigrants had done over $8
   million in damage to his ranching operations during a five-year
   period,^[191] and in the wake of his murder, interviews with his family
   and friends focused on similar crimes and break-ins committed by
   immigrants.^[192]

   A few weeks later, Arizona passed Arizona SB1070, the nation's toughest
   state immigration law.^[193] The law's writers have defended Arizona's
   new illegal immigration law by opining that it is necessary to fight
   violent crime. Though admitting an increase in border-related violence,
   such as home invasions and kidnappings, many Arizona police chiefs,
   such as Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris,^[194] have stated their
   disagreement with the law, arguing that it will distort police
   priorities.^[195] Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, in an interview on
   Horizon, said it is "absolutely appropriate" for law enforcement
   officers to question people about their immigration status during a
   routine stop or investigation.^[196] The law sparked protests in
   Arizona and elsewhere, as well as led to the boycott of Arizona by
   cities and communities nationwide.^[197]

   A 2008 report by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California
   analyzes crime and immigration in California. Since most criminals are
   young adults, the study considered the proportion of foreign-born young
   adults in the general population compared to those in the prison
   population. The researchers found that, while foreign born young adults
   represented about 35% of California's population, they represented only
   about 17% of the prison population. The study concludes, "immigrants
   are underrepresented in California prisons compared to their
   representation in the overall population."^[198]

   In a report published by the Congressional Research Service, illegal
   immigrants who have been released from custody have gone on to commit
   16,226 other crimes between 2008 and mid-2011, including 19 murders,
   142 sex crimes, and thousands of drunk-driving offenses, drug offenses,
   and felonies; roughly one in six illegal immigrants who were released
   were later arrested for committing crimes.^[199]

Response of government[edit]

   An ABC News Poll,^[200] indicates that most respondents (67%) believe
   the United States is not doing enough to keep illegal immigrants from
   coming into the country and, according to a CBS News/New York Times
   poll^[201] most Americans believe that US immigration policy needs
   either fundamental changes (41%) or to be completely rebuilt (49%).

   In an opinion poll by Zogby International in 2005, voters were also
   asked, "Do you support or oppose the Bush administration's proposal to
   give millions of undocumented immigrants guest worker status and the
   opportunity to become citizens?" 35% gave their support; 56 percent
   disagreed. The same poll noted a huge majority, 81%, believes local and
   state police should help federal authorities enforce laws against
   illegal immigration.^[citation needed]

Federal response[edit]

   Although Americans may favor one immigration policy over another,
   perceptions of government and officials' ability to implement these
   policies is consistently negative.^[202]

State and local response[edit]

   According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll,^[203] most
   respondents (55%) believe state or local police forces should arrest
   illegal immigrants they encounter who have not broken any state or
   local laws.

   The previously cited CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll poll
   indicates that most respondents (76%) are against state governments
   issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. A poll by the Field
   Institute found "[California] residents are very much opposed (62% to
   35%) to granting illegal immigrants who do not have legal status in
   this country the right to obtain a California driver's license.
   However, opinion is more divided (49% to 48%) about a plan to issue a
   different kind of driver's license that would allow these immigrants to
   drive but would also identify them as not having legal
   status."^[204]^[205]

   Further, most respondents (63%) in the above-mentioned 2006 Quinnipiac
   University Poll^[206] support local laws passed by communities to fine
   businesses that hire illegal immigrants while 33% oppose it.

   In addition to these opinions, others at the local level have gotten
   involved in grass root, citizen-organized efforts to enhance controls
   on illegal migration.^[207] Several citizen-led anti-illegal migration
   organizations have been created under the "Minuteman" name. These
   organizations developed with the purpose of patrolling the border and
   lobbying legislative bodies to reduce illegal migration. For instance,
   the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps (n.d.) have the following as their
   stated mission: "It is the mission of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps
   to see the borders and coastal boundaries of the United States secured
   against the unlawful and unauthorized entry of all individuals,
   contraband, and foreign military. We will employ all means of civil
   protest, demonstration, and political lobbying to accomplish this
   goal."^[208]

Sanctuary cities[edit]

   Currently there is a lot of controversy around Sanctuary cities, one
   response from the state and local governments. Many American cities
   have designated themselves as sanctuary cities and many other state and
   municipal governments discourage the reporting of illegal immigrants to
   U.S. immigration and Customs Enforcement.^[38] A sanctuary city is
   defined as a city that follows certain practices to protect illegal
   immigrants; these include - cities that do not allow municipal funds or
   resources to be used to enforce federal immigration laws, usually by
   not allowing police or municipal employees to inquire about one's
   immigration status.^[209] These cities include Washington D.C., New
   York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Santa Ana, San Diego,
   San Jose, Salt Lake City, El Paso, Houston, Detroit, Jersey City,
   Minneapolis, Miami, Denver, Baltimore, Seattle, Portland, Oregon, New
   Haven, Somerville, Cambridge, and Portland, Maine.^[210] The
   controversy of this topic comes up around election time when public
   officials are often faced with deciding if they will continue to
   enforce the laws of a sanctuary city or appear to be harsher on
   immigration. Also the public opinion of the cities is not very high, a
   poll in 2011 found that 59% of the population supported a proposal to
   remove federal funding to sanctuary cities and 58% wanted the Justice
   Department to take action against these cities.^[211]

Enforcement[edit]

   71% of respondents in a 2006 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute
   poll believed that enforcement of immigration laws will require
   additional measures beyond a border fence, with 65% of respondents
   supporting employer fines.^[206] 77% of respondents to a Los Angeles
   Times/Bloomberg Poll support employer fines.^[212]^[213]

   A 2007 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll indicates 57% strongly favor
   employer fines and 17% somewhat favor them, while 44% strongly favor
   increased border security and 19% strongly oppose.^[214] In a CBS
   News/New York Times poll, 69% of Americans favor prosecuting and
   deporting illegal immigrants; 33% favor deporting those who have lived
   and worked in the U.S. for at least two years.^[201]^[215]

   The Manhattan Institute reported that 78% of likely Republican voters
   favor a proposal combining increased border security, tougher penalties
   for employers who hire illegal workers, and allowing illegal immigrants
   to register for a temporary worker program that includes a path to
   citizenship. Respondents favored the program over a deportation and
   enforcement-only plan 58% to 33%.^[216]

   Following the passage of Arizona's Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe
   Neighborhoods Act in April, 2010, which authorizes police officials to
   question persons on their immigration status if there is reasonable
   suspicion that they are illegally in the country or committing other
   violations not related to their immigration status, numerous polls
   showed widespread support for the law. A Rasmussen poll found that 60%
   of the electorate support such a law while 31% are opposed to such a
   law.^[217] A New York Times poll showed similar results: 51% of
   Americans felt the law was "about right" in its dealings with illegal
   immigration, 9% felt that its measures did not go far enough to address
   the problem while 36% have negative opinions regarding such a
   law.^[218]

Films[edit]

   How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories is a 12-part documentary film
   series that examines the American political system through the lens of
   immigration reform from 2001–2007, from filmmaking team Shari Robertson
   and Michael Camerini. Several films in the series contain a large focus
   on the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S. and feature advocates
   from both sides of the debate. Since the debut of the first five films,
   the series has become an important resource for advocates,
   policy-makers and educators.^[219]

   The series premiered on HBO with the broadcast debut of The Senator's
   Bargain on March 24, 2010. A directors' cut of The Senators' Bargain
   was featured in the 2010 Human Rights Watch Film Festival at Lincoln
   Center, with the theatrical title Story 12: Last Best Chance. That film
   featured Ted Kennedy's efforts to pass The Comprehensive Immigration
   Reform Act of 2007. The second story in the 12-part series, Mountains
   and Clouds, opened the festival in the same year.

   The films document the attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform
   during the years from 2001–2007, and present a behind-the-scenes story
   of the success (and failure) of many bills from that period with an
   effect on illegal immigration including:
     * The DREAM Act
     * REAL ID Act
     * Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007
     * Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act

   Marking Up The Dream, Story Six in the How Democracy Works Now series,
   focuses on the heated 2003 markup in The Senate Judiciary Committee,
   contrasting optimistic supporters who viewed The DREAM Act as a small
   bi-partisan bill that would help children, with opponents who saw the
   legislation as thinly-veiled amnesty. Also presented in the film are
   the rallies and demonstrations from illegal immigrant students who
   would benefit from the DREAM Act. The film opens with demonstration by
   some illegal high-school students as they stage a mock graduation
   ceremony on the U.S. Capitol lawn.
