Interstate regions[edit]

Official regions of the United States[edit]

   Many regions in the United States are defined in law or regulations by
   the federal government.

Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions[edit]

   U.S. Census Bureau Regions and Divisions

   The United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with
   nine divisions.^[1] The Census Bureau regions are "widely used...for
   data collection and analysis."^[2] The Census Bureau definition is
   pervasive.^[3]^[4]^[5]

   Regional divisions used by the United States Census Bureau:^[6]
     * Region 1: Northeast
          + Division 1: New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,
            New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont)
          + Division 2: Mid-Atlantic (New Jersey, New York, and
            Pennsylvania)
     * Region 2: Midwest (Prior to June 1984, the Midwest Region was
       designated as the North Central Region.)^[6]
          + Division 3: East North Central (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,
            Ohio, and Wisconsin)
          + Division 4: West North Central (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
            Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota)

            Mississippi, and Tennessee)
          + Division 7: West South Central (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,

            Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming)
          + Division 9: Pacific (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and
            Washington)

Standard federal regions[edit]

   Standard federal regions

   The ten standard federal regions were established by OMB (Office of
   Management and Budget) Circular A-105, "Standard Federal Regions," in
   April, 1974, and required for all executive agencies. In recent years,
   some agencies have tailored their field structures to meet program
   needs and facilitate interaction with local, state and regional
   counterparts. However, the OMB must still approve any departures.
     * Region I: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode
       Island, Vermont
     * Region II: New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands

Federal Reserve banks[edit]

   Federal Reserve districts

   The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 divided the country into twelve

   twelve Federal Reserve Banks together form a major part of the Federal
   Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States.

    2. New York
    3. Philadelphia
    4. Cleveland
    5. Richmond

   The Energy Information Administration currently uses the PADD system
   established by Petroleum Administration for War in World War II.^[8] It
   is used for data collection on refining petroleum and its products.
   Each PADD is subdivided into refining districts.
     * PADD I: East Coast
          + East Coast: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
            Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
            Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida;
            along with counties in New York east of, north of and
            including Cayuga, Tompkins, and Chemung; and counties in
            Pennsylvania east of and including Bradford, Sullivan,
            Columbia, Montour, Northumberland, Dauphin and York.

   PADD I can also be subdivided into 3 Subdistricts:
     * Sub-PAD 1A: New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
       Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont)
     * Sub-PAD 1B: Central Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New
       York, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia)
     * Sub-PAD 1C: Lower Atlantic (Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South
       Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia)^[10]

   PADD system was established in World War II and therefore don't
   accurately reflect current trends. The EIA has updated the PADD system
   with a complimentary set of regions to reflect this and will change it
   to suite current needs. (Note: Region 9 includes countries not part of
   the USA but is included for the sake of completion since it contains
   Puerto Rico)
     * Region 1: PADD I
     * Region 2: PADD II "Inland" (States of North Dakota, South Dakota,
       Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, Tennessee and Kentucky)
