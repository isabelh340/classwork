   The national debt of the United States is the amount owed by the
   federal government of the United States. The measure of the public debt
   is the value of the outstanding Treasury securities that have been
   issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies.^[which?]
   The gross national debt consists of two components:^[1]
     * Debt held by the public, such as Treasury securities held by
       investors outside the federal government, including those held by
       individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve System and foreign,
       state and local governments.
     * Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt, such as
       non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts administered by
       the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries, such
       as the Social Security Trust Fund. Debt held by government accounts
       represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings,
       of these accounts that have been invested in Treasury securities.

   In general, debt held by the public increases as a result of government
   spending and decreases as a result of government tax or other receipts,
   which fluctuate in the course of the fiscal year, and in practice
   Treasury securities are not issued or redeemed on a day-by-day
   basis.^[2] (Treasury securities may also be issued or redeemed as part
   of government macroeconomic management.) The aggregate, gross amount
   that Treasury can borrow is limited by the United States debt
   ceiling.^[3]

   Historically, the US public debt as a share of GDP increased during
   wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. The ratio of debt to
   GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or due to growth
   of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public as a share
   of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then
   fell over the following 35 years. In recent decades however, aging
   demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the
   long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal
   policies.^[4]

   On June 30, 2014, debt held by the public was approximately $12.6
   trillion or about 74% of Q1 2014 GDP^[5]^[6] Intragovernmental holdings
   stood at $5.1 trillion (30%), giving a combined total public debt of
   $17.6 trillion or about 103% of Q1 2014 GDP.^[7] As of June 2014, $6.0
   trillion or approximately 48% of the debt held by the public was owned
   by foreign investors, the largest of which were the People's Republic
   of China and Japan at about $1.3 trillion and $1.2 trillion
   respectively.^[8]

History[edit]

   US federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to
   2013, projected to 2038
   Main article: History of the United States public debt

   Except for about a year during 1835–1836, the United States has
   continuously held a public debt since the US Constitution legally went
   into effect on March 4, 1789. Public debt as a percentage of GDP
   reached its highest level during Harry Truman's first presidential
   term, during and after World War II, but fell rapidly in the post-World
   War II period, and reached a low in 1973 under President Richard Nixon.
   Debt as a percentage of GDP has consistently increased since then,
   except during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.

Valuation and measurement[edit]

Public and government accounts[edit]

   Detailed breakdown of government holders of treasury debt and debt
   instruments used of the public portion

   On June 28, 2013, debt held by the public was approximately $11.901
   trillion or about 71.43% of GDP.^[6]^[7] Intragovernmental holdings
   stood at $4.837 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of
   $16.738 trillion.^[7]

   The national debt can also be classified into marketable or
   non-marketable securities. As of March 2012, total marketable
   securities were $10.34 trillion while the non-marketable securities
   were $5.24 trillion.^[9] Most of the marketable securities are Treasury
   notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The
   non-marketable securities are mainly the "government account series"
   owed to certain government trust funds such as the Social Security
   Trust Fund, which represented $2.7 trillion in 2011.^[10] The
   non-marketable securities represent amounts owed to program
   beneficiaries. For example, in the case of the Social Security Trust
   Fund, the payroll taxes dedicated to Social Security were credited to
   the Trust Fund upon receipt, but spent for other purposes. If the
   government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the
   government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the
   Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for
   the other.^[11] Other large intragovernmental holders include the
   Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan
   Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust
   Fund (Medicare).

Accounting treatment[edit]

   U.S. debt from 1940 to 2011. Red lines indicate the "debt held by the
   public" and black lines indicate the total national debt or gross
   public debt. The difference is the "intragovernmental debt," which
   includes obligations to government programs such as Social Security.
   Stated as a formula, National Debt = Debt held by the Public +
   Intragovernmental Debt. The second panel shows the two debt figures as
   a percentage of U.S. GDP (dollar value of U.S. economic production for
   that year). The top panel is deflated so every year is in 2010 dollars.

   Only debt held by the public is reported as a liability on the
   consolidated financial statements of the United States government. Debt
   held by government accounts is an asset to those accounts but a
   liability to the Treasury; they offset each other in the consolidated
   financial statements.^[12]

   Government receipts and expenditures are normally presented on a cash
   rather than an accruals basis, although the accrual basis may provide
   more information on the longer-term implications of the government's
   annual operations.^[13]

   The United States public debt is often expressed as a ratio of public
   debt to gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio of debt to GDP may
   decrease as a result of a government surplus as well as due to growth
   of GDP and inflation.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations excluded[edit]

   See also: Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

   Under normal accounting rules, fully owned companies would be
   consolidated into the books of the owner, but the large size of Fannie
   and Freddie has made the U.S. government reluctant to incorporate
   Freddie and Fannie into its own books. When Freddie and Fannie required
   bail-outs, White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12,
   2008, initially indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the
   GSE debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the
   conservator intervention.^[14] As the intervention has dragged out,
   pundits have started to further question this accounting treatment,
   noting that changes in August 2012 "makes them even more permanent
   wards of the state and turns the government's preferred stock into a
   permanent, perpetual kind of security".^[15] The government controls
   the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which would normally
   criticize inconsistent accounting practices, but it does not oversee
   its own government's accounting practices or the standards set by the
   Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. The on- or off-balance
   sheet obligations of those two independent GSEs was just over
   $5 trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place,
   consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees and agency bonds.^[16]
   The confusing independent but government-controlled status of the GSEs
   has resulted in investors of the legacy common shares and preferred
   shares launching various activist campaigns in 2014.^[17]

Guaranteed obligations excluded[edit]

   See also: Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and Exchange
   Stabilization Fund

   U.S. federal government guarantees are not included in the public debt
   total, until such time as there is a call on the guarantees. For
   example, the U.S. federal government in late-2008 guaranteed large
   amounts of obligations of mutual funds, banks, and corporations under
   several programs designed to deal with the problems arising from the
   late-2000s financial crisis. The funding of direct investments made in
   response to the crisis, such as those made under the Troubled Assets
   Relief Program, are included in the debt.

Unfunded obligations excluded[edit]

   The U.S. government is obligated under current law to make mandatory
   payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for
   these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75
   years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed
   program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll
   taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax
   sources or borrowing.^[18] The present value of these deficits or
   unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8 trillion. This is the amount
   that would have had to be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the
   unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised
   by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7 trillion relates to
   Social Security, while $38.2 trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid.
   In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times
   more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and
   other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly
   $62 trillion.^[19] However, these unfunded obligations are not counted
   in the national debt.

Measuring debt burden[edit]

   GDP is a measure of the total size and output of the economy. One
   measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the
   "Debt to GDP ratio." Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the
   GDP amount. The Congressional Budget Office includes historical budget
   and debt tables along with its annual "Budget and Economic Outlook."
   Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in
   2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011.^[20]

   Mathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows, if the
   rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is
   higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP
   ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in
   GDP is sufficient.

   According to the CIA World Factbook, during 2011, the U.S. debt to GDP
   ratio of 67.8% was the 38th highest in the world. This was measured
   using "debt held by the public."^[21] However, this number excludes
   state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross
   debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the third
   quarter of 2012 was $16.3 trillion, 108% of GDP.^[22]

   The ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the
   "intragovernmental debt" to the "debt held by the public." For example,
   on January 10, 2013, debt held by the public was approximately $11.577
   trillion or about 73% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at
   $4.855 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $16.432
   trillion. U.S. GDP in 2012 was approximately $16.2 trillion, for a
   total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 102%.^[9]^[23]^[23]^[24]

Calculating the annual change in debt[edit]

   Comparison of deficits to change in debt in 2008

   The annual change in debt is not equal to the "total deficit." Social
   Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance
   of the U.S. Postal Service, are considered "off-budget", while most
   other expenditure and receipt categories are considered "on-budget."
   The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or
   surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the
   federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and
   FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and
   FY1998–FY2001.^[25]

   In large part because of Social Security surpluses, the total deficit
   is smaller than the on-budget deficit. The surplus of Social Security
   payroll taxes over benefit payments is spent by the government for
   other purposes. However, the government credits the Social Security
   Trust fund for the surplus amount, adding to the "intragovernmental
   debt." The total federal debt is divided into "intragovernmental debt"
   and "debt held by the public." In other words, spending the "off
   budget" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by
   increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the surplus reduces the
   "total" deficit reported in the media.

   Certain spending called "supplemental appropriations" is outside the
   budget process entirely but adds to the national debt. Funding for the
   Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama
   administration. Certain stimulus measures and earmarks are also outside
   the budget process.

   For example, in FY2008 an off-budget surplus of $183 billion reduced
   the on-budget deficit of $642 billion, resulting in a total federal
   deficit of $459 billion. Media often reported the latter figure. The
   national debt increased by $1,017 billion between the end of FY2007 and
   the end of FY2008.^[26] The federal government publishes the total debt
   owed (public and intragovernmental holdings) at the end of each fiscal
   year^[27] and since FY1957 the amount of debt held by the federal
   government has increased each year.

Reduction[edit]

   Contrary to popular belief, reducing the debt burden (i.e., lowering
   the ratio of debt relative to GDP) is almost always accomplished
   without running budget surpluses. The U.S. has only run surpluses in
   four of the past 40 years (1998-2001) but had several periods where the
   debt to GDP ratio was lowered. This was accomplished by growing GDP (in
   real terms and via inflation) relatively faster than the increase in
   debt.

Negative real interest rates[edit]

   Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest
   rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than
   the interest rate paid on the debt.^[28] Such low rates, outpaced by
   the inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no
   alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional
   investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money
   market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest
   sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against
   risk.^[29]^[30] Economists such as Lawrence Summers and bloggers such
   as Matthew Yglesias have stated that at such low interest rates,
   government borrowing actually saves taxpayer money and improves
   creditworthiness.^[31]^[32]

   In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced
   their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking
   advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee
   that government debt rates will continue to stay so low.^[29]^[33]
   Between 1946 and 1974, the US debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 121% to 32%
   even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which
   were much smaller than the deficits.^[34]

Converting fractional reserve to full reserve banking[edit]

   The two economists, Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof, working for the
   International Monetary Fund published a working paper called The
   Chicago Plan Revisited suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by
   raising bank reserve requirements, converting from fractional reserve
   banking to full reserve banking.^[35]^[36] Economists at the Paris
   School of Economics have commented on the plan, stating that it is
   already the status quo for coinage currency,^[37] and a Norges Bank
   economist has examined the proposal in the context of considering the
   finance industry as part of the real economy.^[38] A Centre for
   Economic Policy Research paper agrees with the conclusion that, "no
   real liability is created by new fiat money creation, and therefore
   public debt does not rise as a result."^[39]

Debt ceiling[edit]

   Main article: United States debt ceiling
   US debt ceiling at the end of each year from 1981 to 2010

   The debt ceiling is a legislative mechanism to limit the amount of
   national debt that can be issued by the Treasury. In effect, it will
   restrain the Treasury from paying for expenditures after the limit has
   been reached, even if the expenditures have already been approved (in
   the budget) and have been appropriated. If this situation were to
   occur, it is unclear whether Treasury would be able to prioritize
   payments on debt to avoid a default on its debt obligations, but it
   would at least have to default on some of its non-debt obligations.
   Congress on several occasions looked like it would allow a default to
   take place.

Debt holdings[edit]

   Estimated ownership each year

   Because a large variety of people own the notes, bills, and bonds in
   the "public" portion of the debt, Treasury also publishes information
   that groups the types of holders by general categories to portray who
   owns United States debt. In this data set, some of the public portion
   is moved and combined with the total government portion, because this
   amount is owned by the Federal Reserve as part of United States
   monetary policy. (See Federal Reserve System.)

   As is apparent from the chart, a little less than half of the total
   national debt is owed to the "Federal Reserve and intragovernmental
   holdings". The foreign and international holders of the debt are also
   put together from the notes, bills, and bonds sections. To the right is
   a chart for the data as of June 2008:

Foreign holdings[edit]

   Composition of US Long-Term Treasury Debt held by foreign states, Nov.
   2005–Nov. 2010. June figures are results of comprehensive Treasury
   Department surveys.

   As of January 2011, foreigners owned $4.45 trillion of U.S. debt, or
   approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $9.49 trillion and
   32% of the total debt of $14.1 trillion.^[40] The largest holders were
   the central banks of China, Japan, Brazil, Taiwan, United Kingdom,
   Switzerland and Russia.^[42] The share held by foreign governments has
   grown over time, rising from 13% of the public debt in 1988^[43] to 25%
   in 2007.^[44]

   As of May 2011 the largest single holder of U.S. government debt was
   China, with 26 percent of all foreign-held U.S. Treasury securities (8%
   of total U.S. public debt).^[45] China's holdings of government debt,
   as a percentage of all foreign-held government debt, have decreased a
   bit between 2010 and 2011, but are up significantly since 2000 (when
   China held just 6 percent of all foreign-held U.S. Treasury
   securities).^[46]

   This exposure to potential financial or political risk should foreign
   banks stop buying Treasury securities or start selling them heavily was
   addressed in a June 2008 report issued by the Bank of International
   Settlements, which stated, "Foreign investors in U.S. dollar assets
   have seen big losses measured in dollars, and still bigger ones
   measured in their own currency. While unlikely, indeed highly
   improbable for public sector investors, a sudden rush for the exits
   cannot be ruled out completely."^[47]

   On May 20, 2007, Kuwait discontinued pegging its currency exclusively
   to the dollar, preferring to use the dollar in a basket of
   currencies.^[48] Syria made a similar announcement on June 4,
   2007.^[49] In September 2009 China, India and Russia said they were
   interested in buying International Monetary Fund gold to diversify
   their dollar-denominated securities.^[50] However, in July 2010 China's
   State Administration of Foreign Exchange "ruled out the option of
   dumping its vast holdings of US Treasury securities" and said gold
   "cannot become a main channel for investing our foreign exchange
   reserves" because the market for gold is too small and prices are too
   volatile.^[51]

   According to Paul Krugman, "It’s true that foreigners now hold large
   claims on the United States, including a fair amount of government
   debt. But every dollar’s worth of foreign claims on America is matched
   by 89 cents’ worth of U.S. claims on foreigners. And because foreigners
   tend to put their U.S. investments into safe, low-yield assets, America
   actually earns more from its assets abroad than it pays to foreign
   investors. If your image is of a nation that’s already deep in hock to
   the Chinese, you’ve been misinformed. Nor are we heading rapidly in
   that direction."^[52]

Forecasting[edit]

   Further information: United States federal budget

CBO short-term outlook[edit]

   CBO reported in its February 2014 Budget and Economic Outlook (which
   covers the 2014-2024 period) that deficits were projected to return to
   approximately the historical average relative to the size of the
   economy (GDP) by 2014. CBO estimated that under current law, the
   deficit would total $514 billion in fiscal year 2014 or 3.0% GDP.
   Deficits would then slowly begin rising again through 2024 due
   primarily to the pressures of an aging population and rising healthcare
   costs per person. The debt to GDP ratio would remain stable for much of
   the decade then begin rising again toward the end of the 10-year
   forecast window, from 74% in 2014 to 79% in 2024.^[53]

CBO long-term outlook[edit]

   CBO-Public Debt Under "Extended" and "Alternate" Scenarios
   Spending for mandatory programs is projected to rise relative to GDP,
   while discretionary programs decline

   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports its Long-Term Budget
   Outlook annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending,
   revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2014 Outlook mainly covers the 25 year
   period through 2039.

   The "extended baseline scenario" assumes that the laws currently on the
   books will be implemented, for the most part. CBO reported in July 2014
   that under this scenario: "If current laws remained generally unchanged
   in the future, federal debt held by the public would decline slightly
   relative to GDP over the next few years. After that, however, growing
   budget deficits would push debt back to and above its current high
   level. Twenty-five years from now, in 2039, federal debt held by the
   public would exceed 100 percent of GDP. Moreover, debt would be on an
   upward path relative to the size of the economy, a trend that could not
   be sustained indefinitely. By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5 percent
   of GDP, larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and federal debt
   held by the public would reach 106 percent of GDP, more than in any
   year except 1946—even without factoring in the economic effects of
   growing debt."^[54]

   The "extended alternative fiscal scenario" assumes the continuation of
   present trends, which result in a more unfavorable debt position and
   adverse economic consequences relative to the baseline scenario. CBO
   reported in July 2014 that under this scenario: "[C]ertain policies
   that are now in place but are scheduled to change under current law are
   assumed to continue, and some provisions of current law that might be
   difficult to sustain for a long period are assumed to be modified.
   Under that scenario, deficits excluding interest payments would be
   about $2 trillion larger over the first decade than those under the
   baseline; subsequently, such deficits would be larger than those under
   the extended baseline by rapidly increasing amounts, doubling as a
   percentage of GDP in less than 10 years. CBO projects that real GNP in
   2039 would be about 5 percent lower under the extended alternative
   fiscal scenario than under the extended baseline with economic
   feedback, and that interest rates would be about three-quarters of a
   percentage point higher. Reflecting the budgetary effects of those
   economic developments, federal debt would rise to 183 percent of GDP in
   2039."^[54]

   Over the long-term, CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory
   spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will
   continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g.,
   Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to
   GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the
   above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios
   that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio
   down.^[54]

   CBO estimated under the baseline scenario that the U.S. debt held by
   the public would increase approximately $8.5 trillion between the end
   of 2014 and 2024. Under a $2 trillion deficit reduction scenario during
   that first decade, federal debt held by the public in 2039 would stand
   at 75 percent of GDP, only slightly above the value of 72 percent at
   the end of 2013. Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for
   that decade, federal debt held by the public would fall to 42 percent
   of GDP in 2039. By comparison, such debt was 35 percent of GDP in 2007
   and has averaged 39 percent of GDP during the past 40 years.^[54]

   CBO reported in September 2011: "The nation cannot continue to sustain
   the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it
   has been accustomed to paying. Citizens will either have to pay more
   for their government, accept less in government services and benefits,
   or both."^[55]

Risks and debates[edit]

   Deficit reduction in the United States

CBO risk factors[edit]

   The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt
   levels in a July 2010 publication:
     * A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of
       government debt, rather than investments in productive capital
       goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and
       incomes than would otherwise occur;
     * If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest
       costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;
     * Rising interest costs would force reductions in government
       programs;
     * Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to
       respond to economic challenges; and
     * An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors
       demand higher interest rates.^[56]

Sustainability[edit]

   According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the United
   States is on a fiscally unsustainable path because of projected future
   increases in Medicare and Social Security spending, and that
   politicians and the electorate have been unwilling to change this
   path.^[18] Further, the subprime mortgage crisis has significantly
   increased the financial burden on the U.S. government, with over
   $10 trillion in commitments or guarantees and $2.6 trillion in
   investments or expenditures as of May 2009, only some of which are
   included in the public debt computation.^[57] However, these concerns
   are not universally shared.^[58]

Risks to economic growth[edit]

   Debt levels may affect economic growth rates. In 2010, economists
   Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported that among the 20 developed
   countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was
   relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just
   1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP).^[59] In April 2013,
   the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study have come into question
   when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon,
   Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.^[60]^[61]
   They found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods
   used, there was no evidence that debt above a specific threshold
   reduces growth.^[62] Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting
   for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth
   remains.^[63] However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have
   argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase,
   rather than the other way around.^[64]^[65]^[66]

   A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that, "Countries
   with debt above 80 percent of GDP and persistent current-account
   [trade] deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal
   deterioration..."^[67]^[68] The statistical relationship between a
   higher trade deficit and higher interest rates was stronger for several
   troubled Eurozone countries, indicating significant private borrowing
   from foreign countries (required to fund a trade deficit) may be a
   bigger factor than government debt in predicting interest rates.^[69]

   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stated in April 2010 that
   "Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold
   at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic
   stability. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a
   rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a
   credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over
   time."^[70]

Mandatory programs[edit]

   While there is significant debate about solutions,^[71] the significant
   long-term risk posed by the increase in mandatory program spending is
   widely recognized,^[72] with health care costs (Medicare and Medicaid)
   the primary risk category.^[73]^[74] In a June 2010 opinion piece in
   the Wall Street Journal, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan
   Greenspan noted that "Only politically toxic cuts or rationing of
   medical care, a marked rise in the eligible age for health and
   retirement benefits, or significant inflation, can close the
   deficit."^[75] If significant reforms are not undertaken, benefits
   under entitlement programs will exceed government income by over
   $40 trillion over the next 75 years.^[74]

Interest costs[edit]

   Components of interest on the debt

   Despite rising debt levels, interest costs have remained at
   approximately 2008 levels (around $450 billion in total) due to lower
   interest rates paid to Treasury debt holders.^[76] However, should
   interest rates return to historical averages, the interest cost would
   increase dramatically. Historian Niall Ferguson described the risk that
   foreign investors would demand higher interest rates as the U.S. debt
   levels increase over time in a November 2009 interview.^[77]

Definition of public debt[edit]

   Economists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in
   May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use,
   while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform
   Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure.^[64] The Center
   on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) cited research by several
   economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public
   figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with
   these Commission members.^[78]

   There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental
   debt, which was approximately $4.6 trillion in February 2011.^[79] For
   example, the CBPP argues: that "large increases in [debt held by the
   public] can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of
   future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders
   outside of the United States, which reduces Americans’ income. By
   contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross
   debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal
   government owes (and pays interest on) to itself."^[78] However, if the
   U.S. government continues to run "on budget" deficits as projected by
   the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue
   marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to
   pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This
   will result in "debt held by the public" replacing "intragovernmental
   debt".^[80]^[81]

Intergenerational equity[edit]

   See also: Intergenerational equity

   One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity.
   For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government
   programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt
   accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose
   risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to
   consider:
     * For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government
       obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an
       asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these
       assets are passed on to them.^[82]
     * As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by
       the wealthiest 5% of the population.^[83] This presents a wealth
       and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people
       in future generations will receive principal or interest from
       investments related to the debt incurred today.
     * To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors
       (approximately half the "debt held by the public" during 2012),
       principal and interest are not directly received by U.S.
       heirs.^[82]
     * Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create
       costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government
       benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal
       crisis).^[56]
     * To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the
       long-term productivity of the economy and its workers, such as via
       useful infrastructure projects or education, future generations may
       benefit.^[84]
     * For every dollar of intragovernmental debt, there is an obligation
       to specific program recipients, generally non-marketable securities
       such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund. Adjustments
       that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs
       to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.

   Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public
   investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to
   future generations than merely passing along debt: "Fiscal policy is,
   indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we’re doing to
   the next generation’s economic prospects. But our sin involves
   investing too little, not borrowing too much." Young workers face high
   unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout
   their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could
   affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger
   Americans.^[85]

   On June 25, 2014, the BEA announced: "[On July 30, 2014, i]n addition
   to the regular revision of estimates for the most recent 3 years and
   for the first quarter of 2014, GDP and select components will be
   revised back to the first quarter of 1999.

   Fiscal years 1940–2009 GDP figures were derived from February 2011
   Office of Management and Budget figures which contained revisions of
   prior year figures due to significant changes from prior GDP
   measurements. Fiscal years 1950–2010 GDP measurements were derived from
   December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be
   subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB
   figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision
   dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.

   Absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP
   percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in
   revisions are stated to be 1.3% ± 2.0% or a 95% probability of being
   within the range of 0.0–3.3%, assuming the differences to occur
   according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference
   of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400 billion increase of a
   $10 trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the
   range would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 ÷ 10,000) or $0 to
   $333 billion different than the hypothetical $400 billion.

   Fiscal years 1940–1970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example,
   Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal
   years 1980–2010 begin October 1 of the previous year.

   Intergovernmental debts before the Social Security Act are presumed to
   equal zero.

       Including non-cash interest accrued primarily for Social Security,
       interest was $454 billion or 18% of tax revenue.^[96]
     * Total U.S. household debt, including mortgage loan and consumer
       debt, was $11.4 trillion in 2005. By comparison, total U.S.

   On June 25, 2014 the BEA announced a 15-year revision of GDP figures
   would take place on July 31, 2014. The figures for this table were
   corrected after that date with changes to FY 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012,
   2013 and 2014.

   The more precise FY 1999–2013 debt figures are derived from Treasury
   audit results.

   The variations in the 1990s and FY 2014 figures are due to
   double-sourced or relatively preliminary GDP figures respectively.

   A comprehensive revision GDP revision dated July 31, 2013 was described
   on the Bureau of Economic
   Analysis website. In November 2013 the total debt and yearly debt as a
   percentage of GDP columns of this table were
   changed to reflect those revised GDP figures.
