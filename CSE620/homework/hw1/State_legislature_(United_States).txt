   A state legislature in the United States is the legislative body of any
   of the 50 U.S. states. The formal name varies from state to state. In
   25 states, the legislature is simply called the Legislature, or the
   State Legislature, while in 19 states, the legislature is called the
   General Assembly. In Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the legislature
   is called the General Court, while North Dakota and Oregon designate
   the legislature as the Legislative Assembly.

Composition[edit]

   Every state except Nebraska has a bicameral legislature, meaning that
   the legislature consists of two separate legislative chambers or
   houses. In each case the smaller chamber is called the Senate and is
   usually referred to as the upper house. This chamber typically, but not
   always, has the exclusive power to confirm appointments made by the
   governor and to try articles of impeachment. (In a few states, a
   separate Executive Council, composed of members elected from large
   districts, performs the confirmation function.) Members of the smaller
   chamber represent more citizens and usually serve for longer terms than
   members of the larger chamber, generally four years. In 41 states, the
   larger chamber is called the House of Representatives. Five states
   designate the larger chamber the Assembly and three states call it the
   House of Delegates. Members of the larger chamber usually serve for
   terms of two years. The larger chamber customarily has the exclusive
   power to initiate taxing legislation and articles of impeachment.

   Prior to United States Supreme Court decisions Reynolds v. Sims and
   Baker v. Carr in the 1960s, the basis of representation in most state
   legislatures was modeled on that of the U.S. Congress: the state
   senators represented geographical units while members of the larger
   chamber represented population. In 1962, the United States Supreme
   Court announced the "one person, one vote" standard and invalidated
   state legislative representation based on geography. (The ruling does
   not affect the U.S. Senate because that chamber's makeup is prescribed
   by the U.S. Constitution.)

Nebraska[edit]

   Main article: Nebraska Legislature

   Nebraska originally had a bicameral legislature like the other states,
   but the lower house was abolished following a referendum, effective
   with the 1936 elections. The remaining unicameral (one-chamber)
   legislature is called the Nebraska Legislature, but its members
   continue to be called senators.

Duties and influence[edit]

   convenes

   As a legislative branch of government, a legislature generally performs
   state duties for a state in the same way that the United States
   Congress performs national duties at the national level. Generally, the
   same system of checks and balances that exists at the Federal level
   also exists between the state legislature, the state executive officer
   (governor) and the state judiciary, though the degree to which this is
   so varies from one state to the next.

   During a legislative session, the legislature considers matters
   introduced by its members or submitted by the governor. Businesses and
   other special interest organizations often lobby the legislature to
   obtain beneficial legislation, defeat unfavorably perceived measures,
   or influence other legislative action. A legislature also approves the
   state's operating and capital budgets, which may begin as a legislative
   proposal or a submission by the governor.

   Under the terms of Article V of the U.S. Constitution, state lawmakers
   retain the power to ratify Constitutional amendments which have been
   proposed by the Congress and they also retain the ability to apply to
   the Congress for a national convention to directly propose
   Constitutional amendments to the states for ratification. Under Article
   II, state legislatures choose the manner of appointing the state's
   presidential electors. Formerly, state legislatures appointed the U.S.
   Senators from their respective states until the ratification of the
   17th Amendment in 1913 required the direct election of Senators by the
   state's voters.

Lawmaking process[edit]

   Generally, the legislative bodies and their committees use either
   Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure or an amended form of them.^[1]
   During official meetings, a professional parliamentarian is available
   to ensure that legislation and accompanying discussion proceed as
   orderly as possible without bias.

Beginnings[edit]

   The lawmaking process begins with the introduction of a bill in either
   the House of Representatives or the Senate. Bills may be introduced in
   either house, sometimes with the exception of bills increasing or
   decreasing revenue, which must originate in the House of
   Representatives. The order of business in each house provides a proper
   time for the introduction of bills.

   Bills are usually assigned consecutive numbers, given in the order of
   their introduction, to facilitate identification. Usually a bill cannot
   become enacted until it has been read on a certain number of days in
   each house. Upon introduction, a bill is usually read by its title
   only, constituting the first reading of the bill. Because a bill is
   usually read by title only, it is important that the title give the
   members notice of the subject matter contained in the bill.

Committees[edit]

General information[edit]

   As with other legislative bodies throughout the world, U. S. state
   legislatures operates mainly through committees when considering
   proposed bills. Thus, committee action is probably the most important
   phase of the legislative process. Most bills cannot be enacted into law
   until it has been referred to, acted upon by, and returned from, a
   standing committee in each house. Reference to committee usually
   follows the first reading of the bill.

   Each committee is set up to consider bills relating to a particular
   subject.

   Standing committees are charged with the important responsibility of
   examining bills and recommending action to the Senate or House. Often
   on days when a legislature is not in session, the committees of each
   house meet and consider the bills that have been referred to them to
   decide if the assigned bills should be reported for further action.

   For most bills, the recommendations of the committee are followed,
   although either house is free to accept or reject the action of the
   committee. Bills reported favorably by a committee may be placed on a
   regular calendar (the agenda of the deliberative body).

   Most of the work of the legislature is done by committees. The
   legislature as a whole relies on its committees to report out only
   those bills deserving the consideration of the entire house.

   Through standing committees, each bill is addressed by a group of
   members who have special knowledge of its subject. Some members of the
   legislature have expert knowledge of particular subjects of
   legislation, and these members are usually placed on committees to take
   full advantage of this specialized knowledge. For this reason, the
   legislature often accepts the final recommendations of its standing
   committees. As has been noted, however, the legislature does not
   completely abdicate its responsibility for the consideration of pending
   bills. If the need arises, the members of either house can force a
   committee to take action on a bill, or they can ignore the committee's
   recommendations.^[citation needed]

Post-committee[edit]

Reports of Committee[edit]

   After a committee has completed work on a bill, it reports the bill to
   the appropriate house during the "reports of committees" in the daily
   order of business. Reported bills are immediately given a second
   reading. The houses do not vote on a bill at the time it is reported;
   however, reported bills are placed on the calendar for the next
   legislative day. This second reading is made by title only.

   The regular calendar is a list of bills that have been favorably
   reported from committee and are ready for consideration by the
   membership of the entire house.

Third reading[edit]

   Regardless of how a bill is placed on the calendar, once the bill is
   considered and adopted, this is called the third reading. It is at this
   third reading of the bill that the entire legislature gives
   consideration to its passage. At this time, the bill may be studied in
   detail, debated, amended, and read at length before final passage.

   If the majority vote in favor of the bill, it is recorded as passed.

Transmission to second house[edit]

   A bill that is passed in one house is transmitted, along with a formal
   message, to the other house. If the bill is not reported from committee
   or is not considered by the full house, the bill is defeated.

   The house of origin, upon return of its amended bill, may take any one
   of several courses of action. It may concur in the amendment by the
   adoption of a motion to that effect; then the bill, having been passed
   by both houses in identical form, is ready for enrollment. Another
   possibility is that the house of origin may adopt a motion to
   non-concur in the amendment, at which point the bill dies. Finally, the
   house of origin may refuse to accept the amendment but request that a
   conference committee be appointed. The other house usually agrees to
   the request, and the presiding officer of each house appoints members
   to the conference committee.

Conference committees[edit]

   A conference committee is often empaneled to discuss the points of
   difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries
   to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be
   passed by both houses. If an agreement is reached and if both houses
   adopt the conference committee's report, the bill is passed. If either
   house refuses to adopt the report of the conference committee, a motion
   may be made for further conference. If a conference committee is unable
   to reach an agreement, it may be discharged, and a new conference
   committee may be appointed. Some highly controversial bills may be
   referred to several different conference committees. If an agreement is
   never reached in conference prior to the end of the legislative
   session, the bill is lost.

   When a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is then ready
   for transmittal to the Governor.

Presentation to the governor[edit]

   Once a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which
   completes its enactment into law. From this point, the bill becomes an
   act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative
   action, or overturned by a court decision. If the governor does not
   approve of the bill, he or she may veto it. In the event of a veto, the
   governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a
   message explaining his or her objections and suggesting any amendments
   (if applicable) which might remove those objections. The bill is then
   reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses
   agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the
   Governor, as he or she revised it, for his or her signature.

   On the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can
   choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally
   passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.
   This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal
   government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to
   override a governor's veto.

   If the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in
   which it originated within a specified number of days after it was
   presented to him or her, it becomes a law without their signature.

   The bills that reach the Governor less than a specified number of days
   before the end of the session may be approved by him or her within ten
   days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not
   become law. This is known as a "pocket veto". This is the most
   conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no
   chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.

Constitutional amendments[edit]

   Sometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done
   simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the state
   constitution. Each state has specified steps intended to make it
   difficult to alter the constitution without the sufficient support of
   either the legislature, or the people, or both.

Aspects of the career of the state legislator[edit]

   In most states, a new state legislature convenes in January of the
   odd-numbered year after the election of members to the larger chamber.
   The period during which the legislature remains in session varies. In
   states where the legislature is considered part-time, a session may
   last several months; where the legislature is considered full-time, the
   session may last all year, with periodic breaks for district work.

   Currently, there are 7,382 state legislators in the United States. They
   are usually assisted by staff aides to help prepare and analyze
   legislation, to review and amend submitted budgets, and to help solve
   constituents' grievances with the state government.

   Many state legislators meet every year at the annual meeting, and other
   meetings, of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which is
   headquartered in Denver, Colorado and has a lobbying office in
   Washington, D.C. The American Legislative Exchange Council, a
   conservative organization focusing on state legislatures, also has an
   annual meeting attracting many legislators.
