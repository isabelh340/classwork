   United States.

   Poverty is a state of privation, or a lack of the usual or socially
   acceptable amount of money or material possessions.^[1] The most common
   measure of poverty in the U.S. is the "poverty threshold" set by the
   U.S. government. This measure recognizes poverty as a lack of those
   goods and services commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream
   society.^[2] The official threshold is adjusted for inflation using the
   consumer price index. The government's definition of poverty is based
   on total income received. For example, the poverty level for 2014 was
   set at $23,850 (total yearly income) for a family of four.^[3] Most
   Americans will spend at least one year below the poverty line at some
   point between ages 25 and 75.^[4] Poverty rates are persistently higher
   in rural and inner city parts of the country as compared to suburban
   areas.^[5]^[6]

   In November 2012 the U.S. Census Bureau said more than 16% of the
   population lived in poverty, including almost 20% of American
   children,^[7] up from 14.3% (approximately 43.6 million) in 2009 and to
   its highest level since 1993. In 2008, 13.2% (39.8 million) Americans
   lived in poverty.^[8] Starting in the 1980s, relative poverty rates
   have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations.^[9]
   California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the
   country.^[10]

   In 2009 the number of people who were in poverty was approaching 1960s
   levels that led to the national War on Poverty.^[11] In 2011 extreme
   poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2
   per day before government benefits, was double 1996 levels at 1.5
   million households, including 2.8 million children.^[12] This would be
   roughly 1.2% of the US population in 2011, presuming a mean household
   size of 2.55 people. Census data for 2011 showed that half the
   population qualified as low income.^[13]

   In 2011, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million
   children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007
   levels.^[14] A 2013 UNICEF report ranked the U.S. as having the second
   highest relative child poverty rates in the developed world.^[15]

   There were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless people
   nationwide in January 2009. Almost two-thirds stayed in an emergency
   shelter or transitional housing program and the other third were living
   on the street, in an abandoned building, or another place not meant for
   human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S.
   population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program
   between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.^[16] Around 44% of
   homeless people are employed.^[17]

Measures of poverty[edit]

Two official measures of poverty[edit]

   Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate: 1959 to 2011. United States.
   Poverty Rates by Age 1959 to 2011. United States.

   There are two basic versions of the federal poverty measure: the
   poverty thresholds (which are the primary version) and the poverty
   guidelines. The Census Bureau issues the poverty thresholds, which are
   generally used for statistical purposes—for example, to estimate the
   number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by
   type of residence, race, and other social, economic, and demographic
   characteristics. The Department of Health and Human Services issues the
   poverty guidelines for administrative purposes—for instance, to
   determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through
   various federal programs.^[18]

   Since the 1960s, the United States government has defined poverty in
   absolute terms. When the Johnson administration declared "war on
   poverty" in 1964, it chose an absolute measure. The "absolute poverty
   line" is the threshold below which families or individuals are
   considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for
   healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter
   and clothing needed to preserve health.

   The "Orshansky Poverty Thresholds" form the basis for the current
   measure of poverty in the U.S. Mollie Orshansky was an economist
   working for the Social Security Administration (SSA). Her work appeared
   at an opportune moment. Orshansky's article was published later in the
   same year that Johnson declared war on poverty. Since her measure was
   absolute (i.e., did not depend on other events), it made it possible to
   objectively answer whether the U.S. government was "winning" this war.
   The newly formed United States Office of Economic Opportunity adopted
   the lower of the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical,
   planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965.

   The Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget)
   adopted Orshansky's definition for statistical use in all Executive
   departments. The measure gave a range of income cutoffs, or thresholds,
   adjusted for factors such as family size, sex of the family head,
   number of children under 18 years old, and farm or non-farm residence.
   The economy food plan (the least costly of four nutritionally adequate
   food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture) was at the core
   of this definition of poverty.^[19]

   At the time of creating the poverty definition, the Department of
   Agriculture found that families of three or more persons spent about
   one third of their after-tax income on food. For these families,
   poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food
   plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds
   for two-person households and persons living alone. Annual updates of
   the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy
   food plan, but updates do not reflect other changes (food is no longer
   one-third of the after-tax income).

   Two changes were made to the poverty definition in 1969. Thresholds for
   non-farm families were tied to annual changes in the Consumer Price
   Index rather than changes in the cost of the economy food plan. Farm
   thresholds were raised from 70 to 85% of the non-farm levels.

   In 1981, further changes were made to the poverty definition. Separate
   thresholds for "farm" and "female-householder" families were
   eliminated. The largest family size category became "nine persons or
   more."^[19]

   Apart from these changes, the U.S. government's approach to measuring
   poverty has remained static for the past forty years.

   Each additional
   person adds    $4,060              $5,080  $4,670

   The poverty guideline figures are not the figures the Census Bureau
   uses to calculate the number of poor persons. The figures that the
   Census Bureau uses are the poverty thresholds. The Census Bureau
   provides an explanation of the difference between poverty thresholds
   and guidelines.^[21] The Census Bureau uses a set of money income
   thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is
   in poverty.^[19] The 2010 figure for a family of 4 with no children
   under 18 years of age is $22,541, while the figure for a family of 4
   with 2 children under 18 is $22,162.^[22] For comparison, the 2011 HHS
   poverty guideline for a family of 4 is $22,350.

Numbers in other countries[edit]

   Comparing poverty levels among countries is difficult, because a
   variety of factors are at play. The official number of poor in the
   United States in 2008 is about 39.1 million people, greater in number
   but not percentage than the officially poor in Indonesia, which has a
   far lower Human Development Index and the next largest population after
   the United States.^[23]^[24] While the percentages appear the same, the
   actual income is not the same among both groups of people living below
   their nation's poverty levels.^[25]^[26]

   Understanding the many aspects, not of using but of comparing poverty
   definitions, can aid perception. Using the Human Poverty Index (HPI),
   or Human Development Index (HDI), may help global comparison in quality
   of living. Yet even when nations use the same method, some issues can
   remain.^[27]

Relative measures of poverty[edit]

   Another way of looking at poverty is in relative terms. "Relative
   poverty" can be defined as having significantly less income and wealth
   than other members of society. Therefore, the relative poverty rate is
   a measure of income inequality. When the standard of living among those
   in more financially advantageous positions rises while that of those
   considered poor stagnates, the relative poverty rate will reflect such
   growing income inequality and increase. Conversely, the relative
   poverty rate can decrease, with low income people coming to have less
   wealth and income if wealthier people's wealth is reduced by a larger
   percentage than theirs. In 1959, a family at the poverty line had an
   income that was 42.64% of the median income.^[citation needed] If the
   poverty line in 1999 was less than 42.64% of the median income, then
   relative poverty would have increased.

   Some critics argue that relying on income disparity to determine who is
   impoverished can be misleading. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data
   suggests that consumer spending varies much less than income. In 2008,
   the “poorest” one fifth of Americans households spent on average
   $12,955 per person for goods and services (other than taxes), the
   second quintile spent $14,168, the third $16,255, the fourth $19,695,
   while the “richest” fifth spent $26,644. The disparity of expenditures
   is much less than the disparity of income.^[28]^[neutrality is
   disputed]

Income distribution and relative poverty[edit]

   Although the relative approach theoretically differs largely from the
   Orshansky definition, crucial variables of both poverty definitions are
   more similar than often thought. First, the so-called standardization
   of income in both approaches is very similar. To make incomes
   comparable among households of different sizes, equivalence scales are
   used to standardize household income to the level of a single person
   household. When compared to the US Census poverty lines, which is based
   on a defined basket of goods, for the most prevalent household types
   both standardization methods show to be very similar.

Poverty and demographics[edit]

   In addition to family status, race/ethnicity and age also correlate
   with high poverty rates in the United States. Although data regarding
   race and poverty are more extensively published and cross tabulated the
   family status correlation is by far the strongest.

Poverty and family status[edit]

   Homeless children in the United States.^[29] The number of homeless
   children reached record highs in 2011,^[30] 2012,^[31] and 2013^[32] at
   about three times their number in 1983.^[31]

   According to the US Census, in 2007 5.8% of all people in married
   families lived in poverty,^[33] as did 26.6% of all persons in single
   parent households^[33] and 19.1% of all persons living alone.^[33] More
   than 75% of all poor households are headed by women (2012).^[34]

By race/ethnicity and family status, based on data from 2007[edit]

   Camden, New Jersey is one of the poorest cities in the United States.

   Among married couple families: 5.8% lived in poverty.^[33] This number
   varied by race and ethnicity as follows:
   5.4% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),^[35]
   9.7% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),^[36] and
   14.9% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)^[37] living in poverty.

   Among single parent (male or female) families: 26.6% lived in
   poverty.^[33] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:
   22.5% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),^[35]
   44.0% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),^[36] and
   33.4% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)^[37] living in poverty.

   Among individuals living alone: 19.1% lived in poverty.^[33] This
   number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:
   18% of white persons (which includes white Hispanics)^[38]
   28.9% of black persons (which includes black Hispanics)^[37] and
   27% of Hispanic persons (of any race)^[39] living in poverty.

Poverty and race/ethnicity[edit]

   The US Census declared that in 2010 15.1% of the general population
   lived in poverty:^[40]
   9.9% of all white persons
   12.1% of all Asian persons
   26.6% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)
   28.4% of all black persons.

   About half of those living in poverty are non-Hispanic white (19.6
   million in 2010),^[40] but poverty rates are much higher for blacks and
   Hispanics. Non-Hispanic white children comprised 57% of all poor rural
   children.^[41]

   In FY 2009, black families comprised 33.3% of TANF families,
   non-Hispanic white families comprised 31.2%, and 28.8% were
   Hispanic.^[42]

Poverty among Native Americans[edit]

   Poverty is also notoriously high on Native American reservations. 7 of
   the 11 poorest counties in per capita income, including the 2 poorest
   in the U.S., encompass Lakota Sioux reservations in South Dakota.^[43]
   This fact has been cited by some critics as a mechanism that enables
   the “kidnapping” of Lakota children by the state of South Dakota's
   Department of Social Services. The Lakota People’s Law Project,^[44]
   among other critics, allege that South Dakota “inappropriately equates
   economic poverty with neglect...South Dakota's rate of identifying
   'neglect' is 18% higher than the national average...In 2010, the
   national average of state discernment of neglect, as a percent of total
   maltreatment of foster children prior to their being taken into custody
   by the state, was 78.3%. In South Dakota the rate was 95.8%.”^[45]

   Poverty in the Pine Ridge Reservation in particular has had
   unprecedented effects on its resident's longevity. “Recent reports
   state the average life expectancy is 45 years old while others state
   that it is 48 years old for men and 52 years old for women. With either
   set of figures, that's the shortest life expectancy for any community
   in the Western Hemisphere outside Haiti, according to The Wall Street
   Journal”^[46]

Poverty and age[edit]

   Poverty rates by gender and work for Americans aged 65 and over

   The US Census declared that in 2010 15.1% of the general population
   lived in poverty:
   22% of all people under age 18
   13.7% of all people 19–64, and
   9% of all people ages 65 and older^[40]

   The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) uses
   a different measure for poverty and declared in 2008 that child poverty
   in the US is 20% and poverty among the elderly is 23%.^[47] The
   non-profit advocacy group Feeding America has released a study (May
   2009) based on 2005–2007 data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the
   Agriculture Department, which claims that 3.5 million children under
   the age of 5 are at risk of hunger in the United States. The study
   claims that in 11 states, Louisiana, which has the highest rate,
   followed by North Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas,
   South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho and Arkansas, more than 20 percent of
   children under 5 are allegedly at risk of going hungry. (Receiving
   fewer than 1,800 calories per day) The study was paid by ConAgra Foods,
   a large food company.^[48]

Child poverty[edit]

   In 2012, 16.1 million children were living in poverty. Out of the 49
   million Americans living in food insecure homes, 15.9 million of them
   were children.^[49] In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels
   in the U.S., with 16.7 million children living in food insecure
   households. 47 million Americans depend on food banks, more than 30%
   above 2007 levels. Households headed by single mothers are most likely
   to be affected. 30 percent of low income single mothers can't even
   afford diapers.^[50] Not having the ability to afford this necessity
   can cause a chain reaction of events to occur, including mental,
   health, and behavioral affects. Some women are forced to make use of
   one or two diapers, using them more than once. This causes rashes and
   sanitation problems as well as health problems for the child and the
   mother. Without diapers, children are unable to enter into daycare. The
   lack of childcare can be detrimental to single mothers by hindering
   their ability to obtain employment.^[50] Worst affected are the
   District of Columbia, Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico and Florida, while
   North Dakota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Massachusetts are
   the least affected.^[14] 31 million low-income children received free
   or reduced-price meals daily through the National School lunch program
   during the 2012 federal fiscal year. Nearly 14 million children are
   estimated to be served by Feeding America with over 3 million being of
   the ages of 5 and under.^[51]

Poverty and education[edit]

   Poverty affects individual access to quality education. The U.S.
   education system is funded by local communities; therefore the quality
   of materials and teachers is reflective of the affluence of community.
   Low income communities are not able to afford the quality education
   that high income communities are. Another important aspect of education
   in low income communities is the apathy of both students and teachers.
   To some the children of the poor or ignorant are seen as mere copies of
   their parents fated to live out the same poor or ignorant life. The
   effect of such a perception can be teachers that will not put forth the
   effort to teach and students that are opposed to learning; in both
   cases the idea is that the poor student is incapable.^[52] Females in
   poverty are also likely to become pregnant at a young age, and with
   fewer resources to care for a child, young women often drop out of
   school.^[53] Due to these and other reasons the quality of education
   between the classes is not equal.^[54]

Food security[edit]

   Main article: Food security in the United States

   Eighty-nine percent of the American households were food secure
   throughout the entire year of 2002, meaning that they had access, at
   all times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all of the
   household members. The remaining households were food insecure at least
   some time during that year. The prevalence of food insecurity rose from
   10.7% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2002, and the prevalence of food insecurity
   with hunger rose from 3.3% to 3.5%.^[55]

   In 2007, 88.9% of American households were food secure throughout the
   entire year.^[56] The number of American households that were food
   secure throughout the entire year dropped to 85.4% in 2008.^[57] The
   prevalence of food insecurity has been essentially unchanged since
   2008.^[58]

Factors in poverty[edit]

   There are numerous factors related to poverty in the United States.
     * According to the American Enterprise Institute, research has shown
       that income and intelligence are related. In a 1998 study, Charles
       Murray compared the earnings of 733 full sibling pairs with
       differing intelligence quotients (IQ’s). He referred to the sample
       as utopian in that the sampled pairs were raised in families with
       virtually no illegitimacy, divorce or poverty. The average earnings
       of sampled individuals with an IQ of under 75 was $11,000, compared
       to $16,000 for those with an IQ between 75 and 90, $23,000 for
       those with an IQ between 90 and 110, $27,000 for those with an IQ
       between 110 and 125, and $38,000 for those with an IQ above
       125.^[59]^[60] Murray's work on IQ has been found faulty by Stephen
       Jay Gould and others.^[61]

     * Income has a high correlation with educational levels. In 2007, the
       median earnings of household headed by individuals with less than a
       9th grade education was $20,805 while households headed by high
       school graduates earned $40,456, households headed holders of
       bachelor’s degree earned $77,605, and families headed by
       individuals with professional degrees earned $100,000.^[62]

     * In many cases poverty is caused by job loss. In 2007, the poverty
       rate was 21.5% for individuals who were unemployed, but only 2.5%
       for individuals who were employed full-time.^[62]

     * In 1991, 8.3% of children in two-parent families were likely to
       live in poverty; 19.6% of children lived with father in single
       parent family; and 47.1% in single parent family headed by
       mother.^[63]

     * Income levels vary with age. For example, the median 2009 income
       for households headed by individuals age 15–24 was only $30,750,
       but increased to $50,188 for household headed by individuals age
       25–34 and $61,083 for household headed by individuals 35–44.^[64]
       Although the reasons are unclear, work experience and additional
       education may be factors.

     * Income levels vary along racial/ethnic lines: 21% of all children
       in the United States live in poverty, about 46% of black children
       and 40% of Latino children live in poverty.^[65] The poverty rate
       is 9.9% for black married couples and only 30% of black children
       are born to married couples (see Marriage below). The poverty rate
       for native born and naturalized whites is identical (9.6%). On the
       other hand, the poverty rate for naturalized blacks is 11.8%
       compared to 25.1% for native born blacks suggesting race alone does
       not explain income disparity. Not all minorities have low incomes.
       Asian families have higher incomes than all other ethnic groups.
       For example, the 2005 median income of Asian families was $68,957
       compared to the median income of white families of $59,124.^[66]
       Asians, however, report discrimination occurrences more frequently
       than blacks. Specifically, 31% of Asians reported employment
       discrimination compared to 26% of blacks in 2005.^[67]

     * The relationship between tax rates and poverty is disputed. A study
       comparing high tax Scandinavian countries with the U. S. suggests
       high tax rates are inversely correlated with poverty rates.^[68]
       The poverty rate, however, is low in some low tax countries such as
       Switzerland. A comparison of poverty rates between states reveals
       that some low tax states have low poverty rates. For example, New
       Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate of any state in the U. S.,
       and has very low taxes (46th among all states). It is true however
       that in those instances, both Switzerland and New Hampshire have a
       very high household income and other measures to levy or offset the
       lack of taxation. For example, Switzerland has Universal Healthcare
       and a free system of education for children as young as four years
       old.^[69] New Hampshire has no state income tax or sales tax, but
       does have the nation's highest property taxes.^[70]

     * The Heritage Foundation speculates that illegal immigration
       increases job competition among low wage earners, both native and
       foreign born. Additionally many first generation immigrants, namely
       those without a high school diploma, are also living in poverty
       themselves.^[71]

Concerns regarding accuracy[edit]

   In recent years, there have been a number of concerns raised about the
   official U.S. poverty measure. In 1995, the National Research Council's
   Committee on National Statistics convened a panel on measuring poverty.
   The findings of the panel were that "the official poverty measure in
   the United States is flawed and does not adequately inform
   policy-makers or the public about who is poor and who is not poor."

   The panel was chaired by Robert Michael, former Dean of the Harris
   School of the University of Chicago. According to Michael, the official
   U.S. poverty measure "has not kept pace with far-reaching changes in
   society and the economy." The panel proposed a model based on
   disposable income:
   “ According to the panel's recommended measure, income would include,
     in addition to money received, the value of non-cash benefits such as
     food stamps, school lunches and public housing that can be used to
     satisfy basic needs. The new measure also would subtract from gross
     income certain expenses that cannot be used for these basic needs, such
     as income taxes, child-support payments, medical costs,
     health-insurance premiums and work-related expenses, including child
     care.^[72]                                                             ”

Understating poverty[edit]

   Many sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in
   the United States is understated, meaning that there are more
   households living in actual poverty than there are households below the
   poverty threshold.^[73] A recent NPR report states that as much as 30%
   of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have
   made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far
   higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold.^[73] A
   study taken in 2012 estimated that roughly 38% of Americans live
   "paycheck to paycheck."^[74]

   According to William H. Chafe, if one used a relative standard for
   measuring poverty (a standard that took into account the rising
   standards of living rather than an absolute dollar figure) then 18% of
   families was living in poverty in 1968, not 13% as officially estimated
   at that time.^[75]

   As far back as 1969, the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward
   suggested budgets for families to live adequately on. 60% of
   working-class Americans lived below one of these budgets, which
   suggested that a far higher proportion of Americans lived in poverty
   than the official poverty line suggested. These findings were also used
   by observers on the left when questioning the long-established view
   that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the
   two decades following the end of the Second World War.^[76]^[77]
   A neighborhood of poor white southerners, Chicago, 1974

   Using a definition of relative poverty (reflecting disposable income
   below half the median of adjusted national income), it was estimated
   that, between 1979 and 1982, 17.1% of Americans lived in poverty.^[78]

   As noted above, the poverty thresholds used by the US government were
   originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty
   initiative in 1963–1964.^[79]^[80] Mollie Orshansky, the government
   economist working at the Social Security Administration who developed
   the thresholds, based the threshold levels on the cost of purchasing
   what in the mid-1950s had been determined by the US Department of
   Agriculture to be the minimal nutritionally-adequate amount of food
   necessary to feed a family. Orshansky multiplied the cost of the food
   basket by a factor of three, under the assumption that the average
   family spent one third of its income on food.

   While the poverty threshold is updated for inflation every year, the
   basket of food used to determine what constitutes being deprived of a
   socially acceptable minimum standard of living has not been updated
   since 1955. As a result, the current poverty line only takes into
   account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago,
   updating their cost using the Consumer Price Index. When methods
   similar to Orshansky’s were used to update the food basket using prices
   for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier, it was
   found that the poverty line should actually be 200% higher than the
   official level being used by the government in that year.^[81]

   Yet even that higher level could still be considered flawed, as it
   would be based almost entirely on food costs and on the assumption that
   families still spend a third of their income on food. In fact,
   Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after-tax income
   on food in 2000.^[82] For many families, the costs of housing, health
   insurance and medical care, transportation, and access to basic
   telecommunications take a much larger bite out of the family’s income
   today than a half century ago; yet, as noted above,^[79]^[80] none of
   these costs are considered in determining the official poverty
   thresholds. According to John Schwarz, a political scientist at the
   University of Arizona:
   “ The official poverty line today is essentially what it takes in
     today's dollars, adjusted for inflation, to purchase the same
     poverty-line level of living that was appropriate to a half century
     ago, in 1955, for that year furnished the basic data for the formula
     for the very first poverty measure. Updated thereafter only for
     inflation, the poverty line lost all connection over time with current
     consumption patterns of the average family. Quite a few families then
     didn't have their own private telephone, or a car, or even a mixer in
     their kitchen... The official poverty line has thus been allowed to
     fall substantially below a socially decent minimum, even though its
     intention was to measure such a minimum.                              ”

   The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with
   both a high cost of living and a high poverty rate such as California
   where the median home price in May 2006 was determined to be
   $564,430.^[83] With half of all homes being priced above the half
   million dollar mark and prices in urban areas such as San Francisco,
   San Jose or Los Angeles being higher than the state average, it is
   almost impossible for not just the poor but also lower middle class
   worker to afford decent housing,^[citation needed] and no possibility
   of home ownership. In the Monterey area, where the low-pay industry of
   agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of
   the population lacks a college education the median home price was
   determined to be $723,790, requiring an upper middle class income which
   only roughly 20% of all households in the county boast.^[83]^[84]

   Such fluctuations in local markets are, however, not considered in the
   Federal poverty threshold, and thus leave many who live in poverty-like
   conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.

   In 2011, the Census Bureau introduced a new supplementary poverty
   measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent
   of poverty in the United States. According to this new measure, 16% of
   Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with 15.2% using the
   official figure. The new measure also estimated that nearly half of all
   Americans lived in poverty that year, defined as living within 200% of
   the federal poverty line.^[85]

   Duke University Professor of Public Policy and Economics Sandy Darity,
   Jr. says, "There is no exact way of measuring poverty. The measures are
   contingent on how we conceive of and define poverty. Efforts to develop
   more refined measures have been dominated by researchers who
   intentionally want to provide estimates that reduce the magnitude of
   poverty."^[86]

Overstating poverty[edit]

   Youth play in Chicago's Stateway Gardens high-rise housing project in
   1973.

   Some critics assert that the official U.S. poverty definition is
   inconsistent with how it is defined by its own citizens and the rest of
   the world, because the U.S. government considers many citizens
   statistically impoverished despite their ability to sufficiently meet
   their basic needs. According to a 2011 paper by poverty expert Robert
   Rector, of the 43.6 million Americans deemed to be below the poverty
   level by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2009, the majority had adequate
   shelter, food, clothing and medical care. In addition, the paper stated
   that those assessed to be below the poverty line in 2011 have a much
   higher quality of living than those who were identified by the census
   40 years ago as being in poverty.^[87]^[88]

   The federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income,
   especially welfare benefits. Thus, if food stamps and public housing
   were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken
   individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift since they
   do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.^[89]

   A 1993 study of low income single mothers titled Making Ends Meet, by
   Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, showed
   that the mothers spent more than their reported incomes because they
   could not "make ends meet" without such expenditures. According to
   Edin, they made up the difference through contributions from family
   members, absent boyfriends, off-the-book jobs, and church charity.

   According to Edin: "No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures, such
   as the occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new
   sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them, or the
   Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they
   will be out on the street if they are not watching TV." However many
   mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses.
   According to Edin, for "most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter
   alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the
   government. For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded
   their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care,
   clothing, and other household expenses."^[90]

Fighting poverty[edit]

   See also: War on poverty and Welfare's effect on poverty

     In the age of inequality, such anti-poverty policies are more
     important than ever, as higher inequality creates both more poverty
     along with steeper barriers to getting ahead, whether through the
     lack of early education, nutrition, adequate housing, and a host of
     other poverty-related conditions that dampen ones chances in life.

   — Jared Bernstein^[91]

   There have been many governmental and nongovernmental efforts to reduce
   poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts
   to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups
   affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic,
   immigrants, or people who are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty
   use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social
   work, legislation, direct service or charity, and community organizing.

   Recent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on
   both "income poverty" and "asset poverty."^[92] Advocates for the
   approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus
   solely on supplementing the income of the poor, through programs such
   as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps.
   According to the CFED 2012 Assets & Opportunity Scorecard, 27 percent
   of households – nearly double the percentage that are income poor – are
   living in “asset poverty.” These families do not have the savings or
   other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be
   purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or
   other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of
   asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five
   families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to
   such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to
   administer the Assets for Independence Program under the supervision of
   the US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables
   community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement
   Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an
   asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA
   savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable
   households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home,
   acquiring a post-secondary education and starting or expanding a small
   business.^[93]

   Additionally, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC or EIC) is a credit
   for people who earn low-to-moderate incomes. This credit allows them to
   get money from the government if their total tax outlay is less than
   the total credit earned, meaning it is not just a reduction in total
   tax paid but can also bring new income to the household. The Earned
   Income Tax Credit is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in
   the United States. There is an ongoing debate in the US about what is
   the most effective way to fight poverty, is it through the tax code
   with the EITC or through the minimum wage laws.

   Government safety net programs put in place since the War on Poverty
   have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012
   using a Supplemental Poverty Model(SPM) created by Columbia University,
   while the official US Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by
   itself has done little to reduce poverty. According to a 2013 Columbia
   University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty,
   without such programs, the poverty rate would be 29% today.^[94] While
   the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the
   elderly, it provides relatively little assistance to the working-age
   poor.^[95] The U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed
   nations.^[96]^[97]
