   The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that

   United States Code.

Uniformed services[edit]

   The seven uniformed services are, in order of precedence by ceremonial
   formation:^[5]
    1. United States Army
    2. United States Marine Corps
    3. United States Navy
    4. United States Air Force
    5. United States Coast Guard
    6. United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps
    7. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned
       Officer Corps

   Each of the uniformed services is administratively headed by a federal
   executive department and its corresponding civilian Cabinet leader.

Federal executive departments[edit]

United States Department of Defense (DOD)[edit]

     * United States Army (USA): 14 June 1775
     * United States Marine Corps (USMC): 10 November 1775
     * United States Navy (USN): 13 October 1775
     * United States Air Force (USAF): 18 September 1947

   Note: The order of precedence within the U.S. Department of Defense is
   set by DOD Directive 1005.8 and is not dependent on the date of
   creation by the U.S. Congress.

United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)[edit]

     * United States Coast Guard (USCG): 4 August 1790

   Note: The U.S. Coast Guard was a part of the U.S. Department of
   Transportation from 1967 to 2002. Prior to 1967, it was a part of the
   U.S. Department of the Treasury.

United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)[edit]

     * United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC): 4
       January 1889

United States Department of Commerce (DOC)[edit]

     * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned
       Officer Corps (NOAA Corps): 22 May 1917

Statutory definition[edit]

   The seven uniformed services are defined by 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(5):

   The term "uniformed services" means—
   (A) the armed forces;
   (B) the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration; and
   (C) the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service.

   The five uniformed services that make up the United States Armed Forces
   are defined in the previous clause 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(4):

     The term "armed forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
     Corps, and Coast Guard.

Armed forces[edit]

   Five of the uniformed services make up the U.S. armed forces, four of
   which are within the U.S. Department of Defense. The Coast Guard is
   part of the Department of Homeland Security and has both military and
   law enforcement duties. Title 14 states that the Coast Guard is part of
   the military at all times, making it the only branch of the military
   outside the Department of Defense. During a declared state of war,
   however, the President or Congress may direct that the Coast Guard
   operate as part of the Navy.^[6] The U.S. Public Health Service
   Commissioned Corps, along with the NOAA Commissioned Corps, operate
   under military rules with the exception of the applicability of the
   Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which they are subject only when
   militarized by executive order or while detailed to any component of
   the armed forces.^[7]

   Reserve components of the United States armed forces are all members of
   the military. The National Guard is a reserve military force composed
   of state National Guard militia units, which operate under Title 32 and
   under state authority. The National Guard was first formed in the
   Colony of Virginia in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force
   founded in the New World. The National Guard can be mobilized by the
   President to operate under Federal authority through Title 10. When
   acting under federal direction, the National Guard of the United States
   is managed by the National Guard Bureau, which is a joint activity
   under the Department of Defense,^[8]^[9]^[10] with a general^[8]^[9] in
   the Army or Air Force as its top leader. The National Guard of the
   United States serves as a reserve component for both the Army and the
   Air Force and can be called up for federal active duty in times of war
   or national emergencies.^[8]^[9]

Noncombatant uniformed services[edit]

     * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps
       (NOAA Corps) is a uniformed branch of the National Oceanic and
       Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is under the Department of
       Commerce.
     * United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) is
       the uniformed personnel system of the United States Public Health
       Service, which is under the Department of Health and Human
       Services.

   Commissioned officers of NOAA and PHS wear uniforms that are derived
   from U.S. Navy uniforms, except that the commissioning devices,
   buttons, and insignia reflect their specific service. Uniformed
   officers of NOAA and PHS are paid on the same scale as members of the
   armed services with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally,
   PHS Officers are covered by the Uniformed Services Employment and
   Reemployment Act and the Service Members Civil Relief Act (formerly the
   Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act). Furthermore, all seven
   Uniformed Services are subject to the provisions of 10 USC 1408, the
   Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA).

   Both noncombatant uniformed services (PHS & NOAA) consist of
   commissioned officers only and have no warrant ranks or enlisted ranks.
   Commissioned officers of the Public Health Service and of the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration can be militarized by the
   President of the United States. Statutory authorization to militarize
   the Public Health Service is under Title 42 U.S.C. (Based on rank,
   commissioned officers of the Public Health Service (USPHS) and NOAA can
   be classified as Category III, IV, and V under the Geneva Convention).
   The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (a predecessor to NOAA) originally
   began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in
   battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the Law of Armed
   Conflict—that is, they could not be tried or executed as spies. The
   Public Health Service (PHS) traces its origins to a system of marine
   hospitals created "for the relief of sick and disabled seamen" by the
   U.S. Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in
   1871.^[11]^[12]
