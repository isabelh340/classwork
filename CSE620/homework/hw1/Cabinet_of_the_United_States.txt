   The Cabinet of the United States is composed of the most senior
   appointed officers of the executive branch of the federal government of
   the United States, who are generally the heads of the federal executive
   departments. The existence of the Cabinet dates back to the first
   President of the United States, George Washington, who appointed a
   Cabinet of four persons: Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson; Secretary
   of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton; Secretary of War Henry Knox; and
   Attorney General Edmund Randolph to advise him and to assist him in
   carrying out his duties.

   All Cabinet members are nominated by the President and then presented
   to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority. If
   they are approved, they are sworn in and then begin their duties. Aside
   from the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General when it was a
   Cabinet office, they all receive the title of Secretary. Members of the
   Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the President, which means that the
   President may dismiss them or reappoint them (to other posts) at will.

In federal law and the Constitution[edit]

   Abraham Lincoln met with his Cabinet for the first reading of the
   Emancipation Proclamation draft, (July 26, 1862).
   The Nixon Cabinet, 1969
   President Gerald R. Ford meeting with his cabinet (June 25, 1976)
   President Jimmy Carter's cabinet meeting (February 13, 1978)
   President Reagan and his cabinet (September 11, 1986)
   President George H. W. Bush and his cabinet in the Cabinet Room
   (September 5, 1989).
   The Clinton Cabinet, in 1993.
   The Bush Cabinet (February 2008).
   The first Obama Cabinet (September 2009).

   There is no explicit definition of the term "Cabinet" in either the
   United States Constitution, the United States Code, or the Code of
   Federal Regulations. There are occasional references to "Cabinet-level
   officers" or "secretaries", which when viewed in their context do refer
   to the "Heads of the Executive Departments" as listed in 5
   U.S.C. § 101.

   "The principal Officer in each of the executive Departments" is
   mentioned in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution, and
   "Heads of Departments" in Clause 2. This is the Article in the
   Constitution about the Executive Branch of the government. Also, "the
   principal officers of the executive departments" are mentioned in
   Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, which is an important section
   concerning the removal of the President when he or she is unable to
   carry out his duties because of some disability. The "principal
   officers" are not necessarily synonymous with cabinet members.

   In 3 U.S.C. § 302 with regard to delegation of authority by the
   President, it is provided that "nothing herein shall be deemed to
   require express authorization in any case in which such an official
   would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the
   President." This pertains directly to the heads of the executive
   departments as each of their offices is created and specified by
   statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority
   to act for the President within their areas of responsibility without
   any specific delegation.

   Under 5 U.S.C. § 3110, federal officials are prohibited from appointing
   their immediate family members to certain governmental positions,
   including those in the Cabinet. Passed in 1967, this law was a
   congressional response in delayed dismay about John F. Kennedy's
   appointment of his brother Robert F. Kennedy to the office of the
   Attorney General.

Salary[edit]

   Main article: Executive Schedule

   Cabinet officials receive an amount of pay determined by Title 5 of the
   United States Code. According to 5 U.S.C. § 5312, Cabinet level
   positions qualify for Level I pay, which was set at an annual salary of
   $199,700 in 2011. Some Cabinet-level officials, including the Vice
   President and the White House Chief of Staff, have their salaries
   determined differently.

Meetings[edit]

   For the first 175 years of its existence, the Cabinet as a body would
   meet frequently, sometimes several times a week. These were so
   important that they continued to be held in the absence of President
   Woodrow Wilson while he was away in France during the Versailles
   conference, leading to the inclusion of the Vice President for the
   first time. During the administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard
   Nixon, the frequency of meeting declined, and by the end of the
   latter's administration, months would pass between sessions.

   An expanded White House staff has taken over many of the functions of
   the Cabinet as a body.

Current Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials[edit]

   See also: Confirmations of Barack Obama's Cabinet

   The individuals listed below were nominated by President Barack Obama
   to form his Cabinet and were confirmed by the United States Senate on
   the date noted. An elected Vice President does not require Senate
   confirmation, nor does the White House Chief of Staff, which is an
   appointed staff position of the Executive Office of the President.
