   The United States district courts are the general trial courts of the
   United States federal court system. Both civil and criminal cases are
   filed in the district court, which is a court of law, equity, and
   admiralty. There is a United States bankruptcy court associated with
   each United States district court. Each federal judicial district has
   at least one courthouse, and many districts have more than one. The
   formal name of a district court is "the United States District Court
   for" the name of the district—for example, the United States District
   Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.

   In contrast to the Supreme Court, which was established by Article III
   of the Constitution, the district courts were established by
   Congress.^[note 1] There is no constitutional requirement that district
   courts exist at all. Indeed, after the ratification of the
   Constitution, some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that
   the federal court system be limited to the Supreme Court, which would
   hear appeals from state courts. This view did not prevail, however, and
   the first Congress created the district court system that is still in
   place today.

   There is at least one judicial district for each state, the District of
   Columbia, and Puerto Rico. District courts in three insular areas—the
   United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana
   Islands—exercise the same jurisdiction as Article III U.S. district
   courts.^[1]^[2]^[3] Despite their name, these courts are technically
   not "District Courts of the United States". Judges on these Article IV
   territorial courts do not enjoy the protections of Article Three of the
   Constitution, and serve terms of ten years rather than for life.

   There are 89 districts in the 50 states, with a total of 94 districts
   including territories.^[4]

Other federal trial courts[edit]

   There are other federal trial courts that have nationwide jurisdiction
   over certain types of cases, but the district court also has concurrent
   jurisdiction over many of those cases, and the district court is the
   only one with jurisdiction over civilian criminal cases. The United
   States Court of International Trade addresses cases involving
   international trade and customs issues. The United States Court of
   Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over most claims for money
   damages against the United States, including disputes over federal
   contracts, unlawful takings of private property by the federal
   government, and suits for injury on federal property or by a federal
   employee. The United States Tax Court has jurisdiction over contested
   pre-assessment determinations of taxes.

United States district judges[edit]

   A judge of a United States district court is officially titled a
   “United States District Judge”. Other federal judges, including circuit
   judges and Supreme Court Justices, can also sit in a district court
   upon assignment by the chief judge of the circuit or by the Chief
   Justice of the United States. The number of judges in each district
   court (and the structure of the judicial system generally) is set by
   Congress in the United States Code. The President appoints the federal
   judges for terms of good behavior (subject to the advice and consent of
   the Senate), so the nominees often share at least some of his
   convictions. In states represented by a senator of the president's
   party, the senator (or the more senior of them if both senators are of
   the president's party) has substantial input into the nominating
   process, and through a tradition known as senatorial courtesy can
   exercise an unofficial veto over a nominee unacceptable to the senator.

   With the exception of the territorial courts (Guam, the Northern
   Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands), federal district judges are
   Article III judges appointed for life, and can be removed involuntarily
   only when they violate the standard of "good behavior". The sole method
   of involuntary removal of a judge is through impeachment by the United
   States House of Representatives followed by a trial in the United
   States Senate and a conviction by a two-thirds vote. Otherwise, a
   judge, even if convicted of a felony criminal offense by a jury, is
   entitled to hold office until retirement or death. In the history of
   the United States, only twelve judges have been impeached by the House,
   and only seven have been removed following conviction in the Senate.
   (For a table that includes the twelve impeached judges, see Impeachment
   in the United States.)

   A judge who has reached the age of 65 (or has become disabled) may
   retire or elect to go on senior status and keep working. Such senior
   judges are not counted in the quota of active judges for the district
   and do only whatever work they are assigned by the chief judge of the
   district, but they keep their offices (called "chambers") and staff,
   and many of them work full-time. A federal judge is addressed in
   writing as "The Honorable John/Jane Doe" or "Hon. John/Jane Doe" and in
   speech as "Judge" or "Judge Doe" or, when presiding in court, "Your
   Honor".

   District judges usually concentrate on managing their court's overall
   caseload, supervising trials, and writing opinions in response to
   important motions like the motion for summary judgment. Since the
   1960s, routine tasks like resolving discovery disputes can, in the
   district judge's discretion, be referred to magistrate judges.
   Magistrate judges can also be requested to prepare reports and
   recommendations on contested matters for the district judge's
   consideration or, with the consent of all parties, to assume complete
   jurisdiction over a case including conducting the trial.

   Federal magistrate judges are appointed by each district court pursuant
   to statute. They are appointed for an eight-year term and may be
   reappointed for additional eight-year terms. A magistrate judge may be
   removed "for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or
   mental disability".^[5] A magistrate judgeship may be a stepping stone
   to a district judgeship nomination.

   As of 2010, there were 678 authorized district court judgeships.^[6] A
   study put forth by Brennan Center for Justice at New York University of
   Law found that under the Obama administration and especially in the
   year 2009 there have been a “uniquely high” number of vacancies in
   Federal Court, averaging 60 or more from the years 2009 to 2013. The
   Obama administration has blamed Senate Republicans for opposing (and
   therefore, not confirming) presidential nominations, while the
   Republicans say Obama has been slow to nominate. ^[7]

   Unlike some state courts, the power of federal courts to hear cases and
   controversies is strictly limited. Federal courts may not decide every
   case that happens to come before them. In order for a district court to
   entertain a lawsuit, Congress must first grant the court subject matter
   jurisdiction over the type of dispute in question. Though Congress may
   theoretically extend the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction to
   the outer limits described in Article III of the Constitution, it has
   always chosen to give the courts a somewhat narrower power.

   The district courts exercise original jurisdiction over—that is, they
   are empowered to conduct trials in—the following types of cases:
     * Civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of
       the United States;^[8]
     * Certain civil actions between citizens of different states;^[9]
     * Civil actions within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction of the
       United States;^[10]
     * Criminal prosecutions brought by the United States;^[11]
     * Civil actions in which the United States is a party;^[12] and
     * Many other types of cases and controversies^[13]

   For most of these cases, the jurisdiction of the federal district
   courts is concurrent with that of the state courts. In other words, a
   plaintiff can choose to bring these cases in either a federal district
   court or a state court. Congress has established a procedure whereby a
   party, typically the defendant, can "remove" a case from state court to
   federal court, provided that the federal court also has original
   jurisdiction over the matter. For certain matters, such as patent and
   copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes,
   the jurisdiction of the district courts is exclusive of that of the
   state courts.^[note 2]

   In addition to their original jurisdiction, the district courts have
   appellate jurisdiction over a very limited class of judgments, orders,
   and decrees.^[14]

Attorneys[edit]

   In order to represent a party in a case in a district court, a person
   must be an attorney at law and generally must be admitted to the bar of
   that particular court. The United States usually does not have a
   separate bar examination for federal practice (except with respect to
   patent practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office).
   Admission to the bar of a district court is generally granted as a
   matter of course to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in the
   state where the district court sits.^[note 3] Many district courts also
   allow an attorney who has been admitted and remains an active member in
   good standing of any state, territory or the District of Columbia bar
   to become a member.^[15] The attorney submits his application with a
   fee and takes the oath of admission. Local practice varies as to
   whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of
   the district.

   Several district courts require attorneys seeking admission to their
   bars to take an additional bar examination on federal law, including
   the following: the Southern District of Ohio,^[16] the Northern
   District of Florida,^[17] and the District of Puerto Rico.^[18]

Appeals[edit]

   Generally, a final ruling by a district court in either a civil or a
   criminal case can be appealed to the United States court of appeals in
   the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located,
   except that some district court rulings involving patents and certain
   other specialized matters must be appealed instead to the United States
   Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and in a very few cases the
   appeal may be taken directly to the United States Supreme Court.

Busiest district courts[edit]

   Eastern District of New York

   The Central District of California is the largest federal district by
   population; it includes all five counties that make up the Greater Los
   Angeles Area. By contrast, New York City and the surrounding
   metropolitan area are divided between the Southern District of New York
   (which includes Manhattan and The Bronx) and the Eastern District of
   New York (which includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island). New York
   suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey are covered by the District of
   Connecticut and District of New Jersey, respectively.

   The Southern District of New York and the Central District of
   California are the largest federal districts by number of judges, with
   28 and 27, respectively.^[19]

   In 2007, the busiest district courts in terms of criminal federal
   felony filings were the District of New Mexico, Western District of
   Texas, Southern District of Texas, and the District of Arizona. These
   four districts all share the border with Mexico.^[20] A crackdown on
   illegal immigration resulted in 75 percent of the criminal cases filed
   in the 94 district courts in 2007 being filed in these four districts
   and the other district that borders Mexico, the Southern District of
   California.^[21]

Extinct district courts[edit]

Subdivided district courts[edit]

   Main article: Former United States district courts

   Most extinct district courts have disappeared by being divided into
   smaller districts. The following courts were subdivided out of
   existence: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
   Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri,
   New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas,
   Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.

Other abolished district courts[edit]

   On rare occasions, an extinct district court was extinguished by
   merging it with other district courts. In every case except one, this
   has restored a district court that had been subdivided:
     * Between 1794 and 1797, the United States District Court for the
       District of North Carolina was divided into the United States
       District Courts for the Districts of Edenton, New Bern, and
       Wilmington.
     * Between 1801 and 1802, the United States District Court for the
       District of New Jersey was divided into the United States District
       Courts for the Districts of East Jersey and West Jersey.
     * When California was admitted as a state in 1850, it was initially
       divided into two districts, the Northern and the Southern.^[22] The
       Southern District of California was abolished on July 27, 1866, and
       the State made to constitute one district, the statute providing
       that the Judge of the Northern District exercise the powers of the
       United States District Court for the District of California, and
       that all records of the Southern District Court be delivered to the
       Clerk of the Northern District Court.^[22] Twenty years later, on
       August 5, 1886, Congress re-created the Southern District of
       California.^[22]
     * Between 1911 and 1961, the United States District Court for the
       District of South Carolina was divided into the United States
       District Courts for the Eastern and Western District of South
       Carolina.
     * The United States District Court for the Eastern District of
       Illinois was eliminated and a new United States District Court for
       the Central District of Illinois was created in its place on
       October 2, 1978.

   There are a few additional extinct district courts that fall into
   neither of the above two patterns.
     * From 1801 to 1802, the District of Columbia and pieces of Maryland
       and Virginia formed the United States District Court for the
       District of Potomac, which was the first United States district
       court to cross state lines. During the same period, the United
       States District Court for the District of Norfolk was carved out of
       another piece of Virginia. The United States District Courts for
       the Districts of Maryland and Virginia remained during this brief
       period.
     * From 1801 to 1802, and again from 1802 to 1872, the state of North
       Carolina was subdivided into the United States District Courts for
       the Districts of Albemarle, Cape Fear, and Pamptico. These courts
       were extinguished when the state was reorganized into the United
       States District Courts for the Eastern and Western Districts of
       North Carolina.
     * The United States District Court for the District of Orleans was
       renamed the United States District Court for the District of
       Louisiana when the Territory of Orleans became the State of
       Louisiana.
     * The United States District Court for the Canal Zone was abolished,
       effective March 31, 1982, as part of the process of returning the
       Canal Zone to Panama. Cases then pending in the Canal Zone court
       were transferred to the United States District Court for the
       Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans.
     * Between 1906 and 1943, there existed a United States Court for
       China that functioned as a district court with jurisdiction over
       American citizens in China.

Notes[edit]

Footnotes[edit]

    1. ^ Article III of the Constitution provides that the "judicial power
       of the United States, shall be vested in . . . such inferior courts
       as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."
    2. ^ In some situations, federal law provides both for the exclusive
       jurisdiction of federal courts and for the immunity of the
       defendant from the power of those courts. One example of this is
       patent-infringement claims against a state government: only the
       federal courts may hear patent cases, but the states have sovereign
       immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment. Although a
       state may choose to waive its immunity in such a case and allow it
       to proceed to trial, if it does not do so, the plaintiff has no
       recourse. This doctrine was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of the
       United States in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense
       Board v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627 (1999).
    3. ^ Nearly all district courts have a Local Rule 11.1 or 83.1 that
       describes the appropriate state judicial institution which admits
       attorneys to practice (either the state bar association or an
       office or committee of the state supreme court).
