                                                 (after 1991)

   A timeline of United States inventions (after 1991) encompasses the
   ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a
   historical context, dating from the Contemporary era to the present
   day, which have been achieved by inventors who are either native-born
   or naturalized citizens of the United States. Copyright protection
   secures a person's right to his or her first-to-invent claim of the
   original invention in question, highlighted in Article I, Section 8,
   Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following
   enumerated power to the United States Congress:
   “ To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
     limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
     respective Writings and Discoveries.                                 ”

   In 1641, the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow
   by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making
   salt.^[1]^[2]^[3] On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed
   the Patent Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 109) into law which proclaimed that
   patents were to be authorized for "any useful art, manufacture, engine,
   machine, or device, or any improvement therein not before known or
   used."^[4] On July 31, 1790, Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford, Vermont
   became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted
   a patent for an improved method of "Making Pot and Pearl Ashes."^[5]
   The Patent Act of 1836 (Ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117) further clarified United
   States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where
   patent applications are filed, processed, and granted, contingent upon
   the language and scope of the claimant's invention, for a patent term
   of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years.^[4]
   However, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (URAA) changed the
   patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years, effective for
   patent applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, thus bringing
   United States patent law further into conformity with international
   patent law.^[6] The modern-day provisions of the law applied to
   inventions are laid out in Title 35 of the United States Code (Ch. 950,
   sec. 1, 66 Stat. 792).

   From 1836 to 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
   (USPTO) has granted a total of 7,861,317 patents^[7] relating to
   several well-known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below.

Contemporary era (1992–present)[edit]

Post–Cold War and the mid-to-late 1990s (1992–1999)[edit]

   1992 Spinner (wheel)
     * A spinner is a type of hubcap that spins independently inside of a
       wheel itself when the vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin
       once the vehicle has come to a stop. Being an attachment to the
       car's wheel, spinners operate by using one or more roller bearings
       to isolate the spinner from the wheel, allowing it to turn while
       the wheel is at rest. The invention of the spinner is credited to
       James J.D. Gragg of Tulsa, Oklahoma who filed a patent on October
       28, 1992 and was issued U.S. patent #5,290,094 on March 4,
       1994.^[8]

   1994 CMOS image sensor
   Early prototype of a CMOS image sensor

   A CMOS image sensor (complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor) is an
   image sensor consisting of an integrated circuit containing an array of
   pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active
   amplifier. Starting at the same point, they have to convert light into
   electrons by using the CMOS process. CMOS image sensors can be found in
   digital SLR cameras, embedded web-cams, video cameras, automotive
   safety systems, swallowable pill cameras, toys and video games, and
   wireless video-security networks. The CMOS image sensor was invented by
   renowned American physicist and engineer Eric Fossum while working at
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.^[9] On
   January 28, 1994, Fossum filed U.S. patent #5,471,515, which was issued
   to him on November 28, 1995.^[10]

   1994 DNA computing

   DNA computing is a form of computing which uses DNA, biochemistry and
   molecular biology, instead of the traditional silicon-based computer
   technologies. DNA computing, or, more generally, molecular computing,
   is a fast developing interdisciplinary area. Research and development
   in this area concerns theory, experiments and applications of DNA
   computing. DNA computing is fundamentally similar to parallel computing
   in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to
   try many different possibilities at once. This field was initially
   invented by Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California in
   1994. Adleman demonstrated a proof-of-concept use of DNA as a form of
   computation which solved the seven-point Hamiltonian path problem.^[11]

   1994 Segway PT
   A top-down view of a Segway PT

   The Segway PT is a two-wheeled, self-balancing, zero-emission, electric
   vehicle used for "personal transport". Segways have had success in
   niche markets such as transportation for police departments, military
   bases, warehouses, corporate campuses or industrial sites, as well as
   tourism. The earliest patent resembling the modern Segway PT, U.S.
   patent #6,357,544, was filed on May 27, 1994 and issued to Dean Kamen
   on December 30, 1997.^[12] However, it wasn't until 2001 when Kamen
   finally introduced his invention to the public.^[13]

   1994 Quantum cascade laser

   A quantum cascade laser is a sliver of semiconductor material about the
   size of a tick. Inside, electrons are constrained within layers of
   gallium and aluminum compounds, called quantum wells are nanometers
   thick, much smaller than the thickness of a hair. Electrons jump from
   one energy level to another, rather than moving smoothly between levels
   and tunnel from one layer to the next going "through" rather than
   "over" energy barriers separating the wells. When the electrons jump,
   they emit photons of light. The quantum cascade laser was co-invented
   by Alfred Y. Cho, Claire F. Gmachl, Federico Capasso, Deborah Sivco,
   Albert Hutchinson, and Alessandro Tredicucci at Bell Laboratories in
   1994.^[14] On April 4, 1994, the Bell Labs team filed U.S. patent
   #5,457,709 that was issued on October 10, 1995.^[15]

   1995 Bose–Einstein condensate
     * A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of bosons
       confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very
       near to absolute zero (0 K, −273.15 °C, or −459.67 °F). It was
       first conceptualized by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in
       1924–25 and was produced in 1995 by Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT and
       Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at
       Boulder National Institute of Standards and Technology
       Laboratory.^[16]

   1995 Screenless hammer mill
     * The screenless hammer mill, like regular hammer mills, is used to
       pound grain. The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate
       small particles from larger ones, rather than a screen, and is thus
       more reliable which results in much more energy efficiency. The
       screenless hammer mill was invented in 1995 by MIT professor and
       engineer Amy B. Smith.^[17]

   1995 Xtracycle
     * An Xtracycle is a load-carrying bicycle. An Xtracycle may be
       constructed by modifying an existing bicycle with an extension
       called a Free Radical or by custom-building an extended-tail
       bicycle frame. While in the country of Nicaragua on a research
       grant, an American named Ross Evans began talking with workers,
       commuters, farmers, and engineers about their transportation needs
       and carrying large loads up to 200 pounds on their bicycles. Hence
       in 1995, Ross Evans conceived the idea and built the first
       Xtracycle. With his friend Kipchoge Spencer, Evans founded
       Xtracycle International. He graduated from Stanford University and
       has since introduced the Xtracycle in communities around the world
       in developing and poor nations such as Ghana, Senegal, and South
       Africa that rely on cheap and efficient modes of
       transportation.^[18]

   1995 Scroll wheel
     * A scroll wheel, or mouse wheel, is a hard plastic or rubbery disc
       on a computer mouse that is used for scrolling up or down on a web
       page. It is perpendicular to the mouse surface and is normally
       located between the left and right mouse buttons. The scroll wheel
       was invented at Microsoft by Eric Michelman in 1995.^[19] On
       December 16, 1998, Michelman filed the earliest patent for a scroll
       wheel, U.S. patent #6,940,488, which was later issued to him on
       September 6, 2005.^[20]

   1995 JavaScript
     * JavaScript is a scripting language widely used for client-side web
       development. It was the originating dialect of the ECMAScript
       standard. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language
       with first-class functions. JavaScript was influenced by many
       languages and was designed to look like Java, but be easier for
       non-programmers to work with. In 1995, JavaScript was invented by
       Brendan Eich under the name Mocha, which was later renamed to
       LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.^[21]

   1996 Adobe Flash
     * Adobe Flash is a multimedia platform created by Macromedia and
       currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its
       introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular method for adding
       animation and interactivity to web pages. The program Flash was
       invented in 1996 by Jonathan Gay while in college and extended it
       while working for Silicon Beach Software and its successors.^[22]

   1996 Bait car
     * A bait car is a vehicle used by a law enforcement agency to capture
       car thieves. The vehicles are specially modified with features
       including GPS tracking and hidden cameras that record audio, video,
       time and date, which can all be remotely monitored by police. A
       remote-controlled immobilizer is installed in the vehicle that
       allows police to disable the engine and lock the doors. The concept
       and technology was invented by Jason Cecchettini in 1996.

   1997 Virtual reality therapy
     * Virtual Reality Immersion Therapy or VRIT is a method using
       specially encoded virtual environments and computers to evaluate
       and treat anxiety disorders such as acrophobia or PTSD. Conceived
       in the early 1990s by Dr. Ralph Lamson, VRIT was clinically proven
       and the key patent 6,425,764 was filed in 1997 for this major
       contribution to treatment of medical conditions involving sensory
       induced disorders by recreating such sensations in a controlled
       manner in an immersive virtual environment with feedback to achieve
       mastery over the causative sensations.^[23]

   1998 HVLS fan
     * An HVLS fan, which is an acronym for High-Volume-Low-Speed, is a
       type of rotational mechanical fan that moves large amounts of
       circulating air. In addition, HVLS fans have been found to be more
       beneficial than traditional HVAC fans as they are more cost
       effective as well as having a stronger cooling effect while helping
       to maintain a constant temperature and humidity. Using 10 overhead
       airfoil blades in a barn, the HVLS fan was invented in 1998 by
       Walter Boyd who was challenged to find a better means to reduce the
       heat stress of dairy cattle which in turn, would increase milk
       production.^[24]

   1999 Torino scale
     * The Torino Scale, invented by Richard P. Binzel in 1999, is a
       method for categorizing the impact hazard associated with
       near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets. It was
       intended as a tool for astronomers and the public to assess the
       seriousness of collision predictions, by combining probability
       statistics and known kinetic damage potentials into a single threat
       value.^[25]

   1999 Phase-change incubator
     * The phase-change incubator is a low-cost, low-maintenance incubator
       to help test for microorganisms in water supplies. It uses small
       balls containing a chemical compound that, when heated and then
       kept insulated, will stay at 37 °C (approx. 99 °F) for 24 hours.
       The phase-change incubator was invented in 1999 by MIT professor
       and engineer Amy B. Smith.^[26]

   1999 Bowtie cotter pin
     * A bowtie cotter pin is a formed wire fastener that resembles an
       R-clip, except it positively locks when installed. The bowtie
       cotter pin was first patented in 1999 by Rue S. Leitzke and Roman
       J. Baus. U.S. patent #6,135,693 was filed on March 23, 1999 and
       issued to Leitzke and Baus on October 24, 2000.^[27]^[28]

   1999 iBOT
     * The iBOT is a stable and mobile powered wheelchair that balances on
       two of a total of six wheels. The iBOT is capable of stair climbing
       as well as the user having the ability to make eye-contact with a
       standing individual. The iBOT was invented by Dean Kamen in
       1999.^[29] Kamen filed U.S. patent #6311794 on October 27, 1999 and
       later being issued on November 6, 2001.^[30]

2000s decade[edit]

   2002 SERF
     * A spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer achieves very
       high magnetic field sensitivity by monitoring a high density vapor
       of alkali metal atoms precessing in a near-zero magnetic field.
       SERF magnetometers are among the most sensitive magnetic field
       sensors and in some cases exceed the performance of SQUID detectors
       of equivalent size. The SERF magnetometer was invented by Michael
       V. Romalis at Princeton University in 2002.^[31]

   2003 Doggles
   A military dog wearing Doggles while being hoisted by a helicopter in
   Afghanistan

   Doggles are sunglasses for dogs in the form of tinted goggles designed
   to fit the shape of a dog's head. While marketed as a fashion item,
   several practical and medical uses have been reported, and prescription
   lenses for dogs with restricted eyesight are available. Doggles were
   co-invented by Kenneth and Veronica Di Lullo.^[32] They filed U.S.
   patent #6,863,032 for their "Animal Eyewear" on January 23, 2003 which
   was subsequently issued on March 8, 2005.^[33]

   2003 Fermionic condensate

   A fermionic condensate is a superfluid phase formed by fermionic
   particles at low temperatures. The first atomic fermionic condensate
   was invented by Deborah S. Jin in 2003.^[34]

   2003 Slingshot (water vapor distillation system)

   Slingshot is a portable water purification device powered by a stirling
   engine running on a combustible fuel source. The size of a dorm fridge,
   the Slingshot is claimed to be capable of turning any water source such
   as urine, saltwater, and arsenic into drinking water. Dean Kamen
   invented the Slingshot.^[35] Kamen filed U.S. patent # 7,340,879 on
   November 13, 2003 for the device which was issued on March 11,
   2008.^[36]

   2007 Nanowire battery

   A nanowire battery is a lithium-ion battery consisting of a stainless
   steel anode covered in silicon nanowires. Silicon, which stores ten
   times more lithium than graphite, allows a far greater energy density
   on a steel anode, thus reducing the mass of the battery. The high
   surface area further allows for fast charging and discharging. The
   practicality of nanowire batteries is reasoned that a laptop computer
   that runs on a regular lithium-ion battery for two hours could
   potentially operate up to 20 hours using a nanowire battery without
   recharging, which would be a considerable advantage for many people
   resulting in energy conservation and cost savings. The nanowire battery
   was co-invented in 2007 by Chinese-American Dr. Yi Cui, an assistant
   professor of materials science and engineering along with his
   colleagues at Stanford University.^[37]^[38]

   2008 Bionic contact lens A bionic contact lens is a digital contact
   lens worn directly on the human eye which in the future, scientists
   believe could one day serve as a useful virtual platform for activities
   such as surfing the World Wide Web, superimposing images on real-world
   objects, playing video games for entertainment, and for monitoring
   patients' medical conditions. The bionic contact lens is a form of
   nanotechnology and microfabrication constructed of light emitting
   diodes, an antenna, and electronic circuit wiring.^[39] The bionic
   contact lens is the 2008 creation of Iranian-American Babak Parviz, an
   electrical engineer at the University of Washington (UW) in
   Seattle.^[40]^[41]

   2008 Trongs

   Trongs are gripping and lifting tools which are made up of three limbs,
   or finger-channels, each with teeth on the end of them. They are
   generally made of polypropylene and are dishwasher safe. Trongs are
   designed for eating finger food such as buffalo wings and barbecue ribs
   so that the user doesn't get his or her fingers messy. They are used in
   pairs so that the user has one for each hand. Trongs were co-invented
   in 2007 by two New Yorkers, Eric Zimmermann and Dan Ferrara Jr.^[42]
   Zimmermann and Ferrara filed U.S. patent #12,682,890 on August 8, 2008
   which was issued on February 24, 2011.^[43]
