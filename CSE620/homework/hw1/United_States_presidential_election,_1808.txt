   President before election

   Thomas Jefferson
   Democratic-Republican
                            Elected President

                            James Madison
                            Democratic-Republican

   The United States presidential election of 1808 was the 6th quadrennial
   presidential election. It was held from Friday, November 4 to
   Wednesday, December 7, 1808. The Democratic-Republican candidate James
   Madison defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.
   Madison had served as United States Secretary of State under incumbent
   Thomas Jefferson, and Pinckney had been the unsuccessful Federalist
   candidate in the election of 1804.

   Sitting Vice President George Clinton, who had served under Thomas
   Jefferson, was also a candidate for President, garnering six electoral
   votes from a wing of the Democratic-Republican Party that disapproved
   of James Madison.

   This election was the first of only two instances in American history
   in which a new President would be selected but the incumbent Vice
   President would continue to serve. (The re-election of John C. Calhoun
   in 1828 was the other instance.)

Balloting[edit]

   Nominations for the 1808 presidential election were made by
   congressional caucuses. With Thomas Jefferson ready to retire, the
   Democratic-Republican caucus nominated Secretary of State James Madison
   of Virginia to succeed him. James Monroe was also a candidate for the
   nomination. Vice President George Clinton was also a candidate for the
   nomination with support from New York Republicans, but was re-nominated
   by the caucus for a second term as Vice President.

   of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York.

General election[edit]

Campaign[edit]

   Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning
   candidate in each county. Shades of blue are for Madison
   (Democratic-Republican), shades of yellow are for Pinckney
   (Federalist), and shades of green are for Monroe
   (Democratic-Republican).

   The election was marked by opposition to Jefferson's Embargo Act of
   1807, a halt to trade with Europe that disproportionately hurt New
   England merchants and was perceived as favoring France over Britain.
   Nonetheless, Jefferson was still very popular with Americans generally
   and Pinckney was soundly defeated, though not as badly as in 1804.
   Pinckney received few electoral votes outside of New England.

Results[edit]

   Pinckney retained the electoral votes of the two states that he carried
   in 1804 (Connecticut and Delaware), and he also picked up New
   Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and three electoral districts
   in North Carolina besides the two electoral districts in Maryland that
   he carried earlier. Except for the North Carolina districts, all of the
   improvement was in New England.

   The faithless electors who voted for George Clinton for President were
   all from New York.
