Federal tribunals in the United States

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   In the United States, the American legal system includes both state
   courts and United States federal courts. The federal tribunals may be
   an Article III tribunal (federal court) or another adjudicative body
   classified as an Article I or an Article IV tribunal. These courts are
   described in reference to the article of the Constitution from which
   the tribunal's authority stems.

Article III tribunals[edit]

   Main article: Federal judiciary of the United States

   Article III tribunals consist of certain federal courts. These courts
   are the Supreme Court of the United States and the inferior courts
   established by the Congress, which currently are the 13 United States
   courts of appeals, the 91 United States district courts, and the U.S.
   Court of International Trade. They constitute the judicial branch of
   the federal government (which is defined by Article III of the
   Constitution). Pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II, all
   members of Article III tribunals are appointed by the President and are
   confirmed by the Senate.

   Under the Constitution, Congress can vest these courts with
   jurisdiction to hear cases involving the Constitution or federal law
   and certain cases involving disputes between citizens of different
   states or countries. Article III includes provisions to protect the
   courts against influence by the other branches of government: judges
   may not have their salaries reduced during their tenure in office, and
   their appointment is for life (barring impeachment).

   The Supreme Court has ruled that only Article III courts may render
   final judgments in cases involving life, liberty, and private property
   rights, with limited exceptions, as discussed below.

Article I tribunals[edit]

   Article I tribunals consist of certain federal courts and other forms
   of adjudicative bodies. These tribunals, as created by Congress, are of
   various forms, and have differing levels of judicial independence. They
   can be Article I Courts (also called legislative courts) set up by
   Congress to review agency decisions, military courts-martial appeal
   courts, ancillary courts with judges appointed by Article III appeals
   court judges, or administrative agencies and administrative law judges
   (ALJs).

   Article I judges do not enjoy the same protections as their Article III
   counterparts. For example, these judges do not enjoy life tenure, and
   Congress may reduce their salaries.

   The existence of Article I tribunals has been controversial, and their
   power has been challenged before the United States Supreme Court, which
   has determined that Article I tribunals may exist, but that their power
   must be circumscribed and, when a potential deprivation of life,
   liberty, property, or property interest is involved, their decisions
   are often subject to ultimate review in an Article III court.

Article IV tribunals[edit]

   The United States territorial courts are tribunals established in
   territories of the United States by the United States Congress,
   pursuant to its power under Article Four of the United States
   Constitution, the Territorial Clause.^[1] Many United States
   territorial courts are defunct because the territories under their
   jurisdictions have become states or have been retroceded.

   An example of a territorial court is the High Court of American Samoa,
   a court established pursuant to the Constitution of American Samoa. As
   an unincorporated territory, the Ratification Act of 1929 vested all
   civil, judicial and military powers in the President, who in turn
   delegated authority to the Secretary of the Interior in Executive Order
   10264, who in turn promulgated the Constitution of American Samoa,
   which authorizes the court. As such, the Secretary retains ultimate
   authority over the courts.^[2]

   Other United States territorial courts still in existence are:
     * District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands
     * District Court of Guam
     * District Court of the Virgin Islands

Congress establishes Article III Court for Puerto Rico[edit]

   Before 1966, the United States District Court in Puerto Rico was an
   Article IV court.^[3] In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed
   Pub.L. 89–571, 80 Stat. 764, which transformed the Article IV federal
   district court in Puerto Rico to an Article III Court. This Act of
   Congress was not conducted pursuant to Article IV of the Constitution,
   the Territorial Clause, but rather under Article III. This marks the
   first and only occasion in United States history in which Congress has
   established an Article III Court in a territory other than the District
   of Columbia. From then on, judges appointed to serve on the Puerto Rico
   federal district court have been Article III judges appointed under the
   Constitution of the United States. Like their mainland brethren they
   are entitled to life tenure and salary protection.

   This important change in the federal judicial structure of the island
   was implemented not as a request of the Commonwealth government, but
   rather at the repeated request of the Judicial Conference of the United
   States.^[4]

   The District Court of Puerto Rico is part of the First Circuit, which
   sits in Boston.

Supreme Court rulings limiting the power of Article I and Article IV
tribunals[edit]

   The concept of a legislative court was first defined by Chief Justice
   John Marshall in the case of American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton,
   1 Pet. 511 (1828), which is sometimes referred to as Canter, after a
   claimant in the case. In this case, a court in what was then the
   Territory of Florida had made a ruling on the disposition of some bales
   of cotton that had been recovered from a sunken ship. This clearly fell
   into the realm of admiralty law, which is part of the federal judicial
   power according to Article III of the Constitution. Yet the judges of
   the Florida Territorial Court had four-year terms, not the lifetime
   appointments required by Article III of the Constitution. Marshall's
   solution was to declare that territorial courts were established under
   Article I of the constitution. As such, they could not exercise the
   federal judicial power, and therefore the law that placed admiralty
   cases in their jurisdiction was unconstitutional.

   Tenure that is guaranteed by the Constitution is a badge of a judge of
   an Article III court. The argument that mere statutory tenure is
   sufficient for judges of Article III courts was authoritatively
   answered in Ex parte Bakelite Corp.:^[5]

     ... the argument is fallacious. It mistakenly assumes that whether a
     court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of
     Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the
     court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred. Nor has there
     been any settled practice on the part of Congress which gives
     special significance to the absence or presence of a provision
     respecting the tenure of judges. This may be illustrated by two
     citations. The same Congress that created the Court of Customs
     Appeals made provision for five additional circuit judges and
     declared that they should [370 U.S. 530, 597] hold their offices
     during good behavior; and yet the status of the judges was the same
     as it would have been had that declaration been omitted. In creating
     courts for some of the Territories Congress failed to include a
     provision fixing the tenure of the judges; but the courts became
     legislative courts just as if such a provision had been included.

   In Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, the court made the following statement
   regarding courts in unincorporated territories:

     Upon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as
     inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside
     the mainland, Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 266-267; Balzac v.
     Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 312-313; cf. Dorr v. United States, 195
     U.S. 138, 145, 149, and to the consular courts established by
     concessions from foreign countries, In re Ross, 140 U.S. 453,
     464-465, 480.

   Ever since Canter, the federal courts have been wrestling with the
   division between legislative and judicial courts. The Supreme Court
   most thoroughly delineated the permissible scope of Article I tribunals
   in Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982),
   striking down the statute that created the original U.S. bankruptcy
   court. The Court noted in that opinion that the framers of the
   Constitution had developed a scheme of separation of powers which
   clearly required that the judiciary be kept independent of the other
   two branches via the mechanism of lifetime appointments. This decision
   was subsequently revisited and affirmed in Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S.
   ___ (2011). However, the Court noted three situations (based on
   historical understanding) in which Congress could give judicial power
   to non-Article III courts:
    1. Courts for non-state areas (U.S. territories and the District of
       Columbia) in which Congress is acting as both local and national
       government.
    2. Military courts (or courts-martial), under the historical
       understanding and clearly laid out exceptions in the Constitution.
    3. Legislative courts established under the premise that, where
       Congress could have simply given the Executive Branch the power to
       make a decision, it has the lesser power to create a tribunal to
       make that decision. This power is limited to adjudication of public
       rights, such as the settling of disputes between the citizens and
       the government.

   The Court also found that Congress has the power under Article I to
   create adjunct tribunals, so long as the "essential attributes of
   judicial power" stay in Article III courts. This power derives from two
   sources. First, when Congress creates rights, it can require those
   asserting such rights to go through an Article I tribunal. Second,
   Congress can create non-Article III tribunals to help Article III
   courts deal with their workload, but only if the Article I tribunals
   are under the control of the Article III courts. The bankruptcy courts,
   as well as the tribunals of magistrate judges who decide some issues in
   the district courts, fall within this category of "adjunct" tribunals.
   All actions heard in an Article I tribunal are subject to de novo
   review in the supervising Article III court, which retains the
   exclusive power to make and enforce final judgments.

   Pursuant to Congress' authority under Article IV, §3, of the
   Constitution to "make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the
   Territory or other Property belonging to the United States;" Congress
   may create territorial courts and vest them with subject-matter
   jurisdiction over causes arising under both federal law and local law.
   But "the Supreme Court long ago determined that in the 'unincorporated'
   territories, such as American Samoa, the guarantees of the Constitution
   apply only insofar as its 'fundamental limitations in favor of personal
   rights' express 'principles which are the basis of all free government
   which cannot be with impunity transcended.'"^[6]

   The Supreme Court noted in Commodity Futures Trading Commission v.
   Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1986), that parties to litigation may voluntarily
   waive their right to an Article III tribunal and thereby submit
   themselves to a binding judgment from an Article I tribunal. However,
   the Supreme Court later noted in Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. ___
   (2011), that a party's right to an Article III tribunal is not always
   voluntarily waiveable in an Article I tribunal for suits at common law.
   Similarly, in Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33 (1989),
   the Court noted that a litigant's right to jury trial under Article VII
   is also not generally waivable in an Article I tribunal for suits at
   common law. The Supreme Court further noted in Granfinanciera and Stern
   the parallel analysis of rights under Article III and Article VII.

   The U.S. Supreme Court in the course of the opinion from Rassmussen v.
   United States (197 U.S. 596, 524) declared (p. 352, L. ed. p. 186, Sup.
   Ct. Rep. p. 1119):

          'Alaska is one of the territories of the United States. It was
          so designated in that order [referring to the order of this
          court assigning to the ninth circuit], and has always been so
          regarded. And the court established by the act of 1884 is the
          court of last resort within the limits of that territory. It is,
          therefore, in every substantial sense, the supreme court of that
          territory.'

   Article IV judges do not have the authority to decide petitioners'
   appeals or be appointed to a United States Court of Appeals.^[7] In
   Nguyen v. United States (2003), the Supreme Court ruled that a panel of
   the Court of Appeals consisting of two Article III judges and one
   Article IV judge did not have the authority to decide petitioners'
   appeals.
