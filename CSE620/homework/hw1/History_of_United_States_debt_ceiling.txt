   The history of United States debt ceiling deals with movements in the
   United States debt ceiling since it was created in 1917. Management of
   the United States public debt is an important part of the
   macroeconomics of the United States economy and finance system.

Overview[edit]

   A statutorily imposed debt ceiling has been in effect since 1917 when
   the US Congress passed the Second Liberty Bond Act. Before 1917 there
   was no debt ceiling in force, but there were parliamentary procedural
   limitations on the level of possible debt that could be held by
   government.

   US government indebtedness has been the norm in United States financial
   history, as well of most Western European and North American countries,
   for the past 200 years.
     * The US has been in debt every year except for 1835.
     * Debts incurred during the American Revolutionary War and under the
       Articles of Confederation led to the first yearly report on the
       amount of the debt ($75,463,476.52 on January 1, 1791^[1]).
     * Every President since Herbert Hoover has added to the national debt
       expressed in absolute dollars. The debt ceiling has been raised 74
       times since March 1962,^[2] including 18 times under Ronald Reagan,
       eight times under Bill Clinton, seven times under George W. Bush,
       and five times under Barack Obama.

Early history[edit]

   Prior to 1917, the United States had no Debt Ceiling. Congress either
   authorized specific loans or allowed Treasury to issue certain debt
   instruments and individual debt issues for specific purposes. Sometimes
   Congress gave Treasury discretion over what type of debt instrument
   would be issued.^[3]

   Between 1788 and 1917 the amount of each bond issue by the United
   States Treasury had to be separately authorized by Congress by passing
   a legislative act that approved the bond issue. Congress limited the
   amount of debt by virtue of its authority to approve or disapprove
   individual bonds.

   In 1917 (and during World War I) the Debt Ceiling Law was passed, which
   allowed the executive branch to issue bonds and take on other debt
   without Congressional approval, as long as the total debt fell under
   the statutory debt ceiling. The United States first instituted a
   statutory debt limit with the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. This
   legislation set limits on the aggregate amount of debt that could be
   accumulated through individual categories of debt (such as bonds and
   bills).

   In 1939, Congress instituted the first limit on total accumulated debt
   over all kinds of instruments.^[4] The debt ceiling, in which an
   aggregate limit is applied to nearly all federal debt, was
   substantially established by Public Debt Acts^[5]^[6] passed in 1939
   and 1941 and subsequently amended. The United States Public Debt Act of
   1939 eliminated separate limits on different types of debt.^[7] The
   Public Debt Act of 1941 raised the aggregate debt limit on all
   obligations to $65 billion, and consolidated nearly all federal
   borrowing under the U.S. Treasury and eliminated the tax-exemption of
   interest and profit on government debt.^[7]

   Subsequent Public Debt Acts amended the aggregate debt limit: the 1942,
   1943, 1944, and 1945 acts raised the limit to $125 billion, $210
   billion, $260 billion, and $300 billion respectively.^[7] In 1946, the
   Public Debt Act was amended to reduce the debt limit to $275
   billion.^[7] The limit stayed unchanged until 1954, the Korean War
   being financed through taxation.^[8]

   A feature of the Public Debt Acts, unlike the 1919 Victory Liberty Bond
   Act which financed American costs in the First World War, was that the
   new ceiling was set about 10% above the actual federal debt at the
   time.^[8]

1970s[edit]

   Prior to the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the debt
   ceiling played an important role since Congress had few opportunities
   to hold hearings and debates on the budget.^[9] James Surowiecki argued
   that the debt ceiling lost its usefulness after these reforms to the
   budget process.^[10]

   In 1979, noting the potential problems of hitting a default, Dick
   Gephardt imposed the "Gephardt Rule," a parliamentary rule that deemed
   the debt ceiling raised when a budget was passed. This resolved the
   contradiction in voting for appropriations but not voting to fund them.
   The rule stood until it was repealed by Congress in 1995.^[11]

Number of requests for increase[edit]

   Depending on who is doing the research, it is said that the US has
   raised its debt ceiling (in some form or other) at least 90 times in
   the 20th century.^[12]

   Congress has raised the debt ceiling 14 times from 2001-2013. The debt
   ceiling was raised a total of 7 times (total increase of $5365bil)
   during Pres. Bush's eight year term and it has been raised 7 times (as
   of 10/2013 a total increase of $5385bil) under Pres. Obama's term as of
   2013 (five years in office). Since 1965, the frequency of debt ceiling
   increases is about on average.[1]

1995 debt ceiling crisis[edit]

   Main article: United States federal government shutdown of 1995–96

   The 1995 request for a debt ceiling increase led to debate in Congress
   on reduction of the size of the federal government, which led to the
   non-passage of the federal budget, and the United States federal
   government shutdown of 1995–96. The ceiling was eventually increased
   and the government shutdown resolved.^[13]^[14]

2011 debt ceiling crisis[edit]

   Main article: United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011

   In 2011, Republicans in Congress used the debt ceiling as leverage for
   deficit reduction because of the lack of Congressional normal order for
   fiscal year budget votes on the chamber floors and subsequent
   conference reconciliations between the House and the Senate for final
   budgets. The credit downgrade and debt ceiling debacle contributed to
   the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 2,000 points in late July and
   August. Following the downgrade itself, the DJIA had one of its worst
   days in history and fell 635 points on August 8.^[15] The GAO estimated
   that the delay in raising the debt ceiling raised borrowing costs for
   the government by $1.3 billion in 2011 and noted that the delay would
   also raise costs in later years. The Bipartisan Policy Center extended
   the GAO's estimates and found that the delay raised borrowing costs by
   $18.9 billion over ten years.^[16]

2013 debt ceiling crisis[edit]

   Main article: United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013

   Following the increase in the debt ceiling to $16.394 trillion in
   2011,^[17] the United States again reached the debt ceiling on December
   31, 2012 and the Treasury began taking extraordinary measures. The
   fiscal cliff was resolved with the passage of the American Taxpayer
   Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), but no action was taken on the debt ceiling.
   With the ATRA tax cuts, the government indicated that the debt ceiling
   needed to raise by $700 billion for it to continue financing operations
   for the rest of the 2013 fiscal year^[18] and that extraordinary
   measures were expected to be exhausted by February 15.^[19] Treasury
   has said it is not set up to prioritize payments, and it's not clear
   that it would be legal to do so. Given this situation, Treasury would
   simply delay payments if funds could not be raised through
   extraordinary measures and the debt ceiling had not been raised. This
   would put a freeze on 7% of the nation's GDP, a contraction greater
   than the Great Recession. The economic damage would worsen as
   recipients of social security benefits, government contracts, and other
   government payments cut back on spending in response to having the
   freeze in their revenue.^[20]

   The No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 suspended the debt ceiling from
   February 4, 2013 until May 19, 2013. On May 19, the debt ceiling was
   formally raised to approximately $16.699 trillion to accommodate the
   borrowing done during the suspension period. However, after the end of
   the suspension, the ceiling was raised only to the actual debt at that
   time, and Treasury needed to activate extraordinary measures to avoid a
   default. With the impacts of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
   tax increases on those who make $400,000 per year, the 2013 sequester,
   and a $60 billion payment from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that will
   reach the Treasury on June 28, 2013, the extraordinary measures are
   currently predicted to last until October 17 by the Treasury, [2] but
   financial firms suggest funds may last a little longer. Jefferies Group
   says extraordinary measures may last until the end of October while
   Credit Suisse estimates mid-November.[3]

   Notes:

   1. The figures are unadjusted for the time value of money, such as
   interest and inflation and the size of the economy that generated a
   debt

   2. The debt ceiling is an aggregate of gross debt, which includes debt
   in hands of public and in Intragovernment accounts

   3. The debt ceiling does not necessarily reflect the level of actual
   debt
