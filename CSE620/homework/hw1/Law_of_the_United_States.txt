   The United States Constitution

   The law of the United States comprises many levels^[1] of codified and
   uncodified forms of law, of which the most important is the United
   States Constitution, the foundation of the federal government of the
   United States. The Constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law,
   which consists of acts of Congress,^[2] treaties ratified by the
   Senate,^[3] regulations promulgated by the executive branch,^[4] and
   case law originating from the federal judiciary.^[5] The United States
   Code is the official compilation and codification of general and
   permanent federal statutory law.

   Federal law and treaties, so long as they are in accordance with the
   Constitution, as well as the Constitution itself, preempt conflicting
   state and territorial laws in the 50 U.S. states and in the
   territories.^[6] However, the scope of federal preemption is limited
   because the scope of federal power is not universal. In the
   dual-sovereign^[7] system of American federalism (actually
   tripartite^[8] because of the presence of Indian reservations), states
   are the plenary sovereigns, each with their own constitution, while the
   federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority
   enumerated in the Constitution.^[9] Indeed, states may grant their
   citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they
   do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights.^[10]^[11] Thus,
   most U.S. law (especially the actual "living law" of contract, tort,
   property, criminal, and family law experienced by the majority of
   citizens on a day-to-day basis) consists primarily of state law, which
   can and does vary greatly from one state to the next.^[12]^[13]

   At both the federal and state levels, the law of the United States is
   largely derived from the common law system of English law, which was in
   force at the time of the Revolutionary War.^[14]^[15] However, American
   law has diverged greatly from its English ancestor both in terms of
   substance and procedure,^[16] and has incorporated a number of civil
   law innovations.

General overview[edit]

   Law affects every aspect of American life, including parking lots. Note
   the citations to statutes on the sign.

Sources of law[edit]

   In the United States, the law is derived from five sources:
   constitutional law, statutory law, treaties, administrative
   regulations, and the common law (which includes case law).^[17]

Constitutionality[edit]

   Where Congress enacts a statute that conflicts with the Constitution,
   the Supreme Court may find that law unconstitutional and declare it
   invalid.^[18]

   Notably, a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it
   has been found unconstitutional; it must be deleted by a subsequent
   statute. Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for
   decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional. However, under
   the principle of stare decisis, no sensible lower court will enforce an
   unconstitutional statute, and any court that does so will be reversed
   by the Supreme Court.^[19] Conversely, any court that refuses to
   enforce a constitutional statute (where such constitutionality has been
   expressly established in prior cases) will risk reversal by the Supreme
   Court.^[20]^[21]

American common law[edit]

   The United States and most Commonwealth countries are heirs to the
   common law legal tradition of English law.^[22] Certain practices
   traditionally allowed under English common law were expressly outlawed
   by the Constitution, such as bills of attainder^[23] and general search
   warrants.^[24]

   As common law courts, U.S. courts have inherited the principle of stare
   decisis.^[25] American judges, like common law judges elsewhere, not
   only apply the law, they also make the law, to the extent that their
   decisions in the cases before them become precedent for decisions in
   future cases.^[26]

   The actual substance of English law was formally "received" into the
   United States in several ways. First, all U.S. states except Louisiana
   have enacted "reception statutes" which generally state that the common
   law of England (particularly judge-made law) is the law of the state to
   the extent that it is not repugnant to domestic law or indigenous
   conditions.^[27] Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date
   for reception, such as the date of a colony's founding, while others
   are deliberately vague.^[28] Thus, contemporary U.S. courts often cite
   pre-Revolution cases when discussing the evolution of an ancient
   judge-made common law principle into its modern form,^[28] such as the
   heightened duty of care traditionally imposed upon common
   carriers.^[29]

   Second, a small number of important British statutes in effect at the
   time of the Revolution have been independently reenacted by U.S.
   states. Two examples that many lawyers will recognize are the Statute
   of Frauds (still widely known in the U.S. by that name) and the Statute
   of 13 Elizabeth (the ancestor of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act).
   Such English statutes are still regularly cited in contemporary
   American cases interpreting their modern American descendants.^[30]

   However, it is important to understand that despite the presence of
   reception statutes, much of contemporary American common law has
   diverged significantly from English common law.^[31] The reason is that
   although the courts of the various Commonwealth nations are often
   influenced by each other's rulings, American courts rarely follow
   post-Revolution Commonwealth rulings unless there is no American ruling
   on point, the facts and law at issue are nearly identical, and the
   reasoning is strongly persuasive.

   Early on, American courts, even after the Revolution, often did cite
   contemporary English cases. This was because appellate decisions from
   many American courts were not regularly reported until the mid-19th
   century; lawyers and judges, as creatures of habit, used English legal
   materials to fill the gap.^[32] But citations to English decisions
   gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American courts
   developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the
   American people.^[33] The number of published volumes of American
   reports soared from eighteen in 1810 to over 8,000 by 1910.^[34] By
   1879 one of the delegates to the California constitutional convention
   was already complaining: "Now, when we require them to state the
   reasons for a decision, we do not mean they shall write a hundred pages
   of detail. We [do] not mean that they shall include the small cases,
   and impose on the country all this fine judicial literature, for the
   Lord knows we have got enough of that already."^[35]

   Today, in the words of Stanford law professor Lawrence Friedman:
   "American cases rarely cite foreign materials. Courts occasionally cite
   a British classic or two, a famous old case, or a nod to Blackstone;
   but current British law almost never gets any mention."^[36] Foreign
   law has never been cited as binding precedent, but as a reflection of
   the shared values of Anglo-American civilization or even Western
   civilization in general.^[37]

Levels of law[edit]

Federal law[edit]

   Federal law originates with the Constitution, which gives Congress the
   power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating
   interstate commerce. The United States Code is the official compilation
   and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes. Many
   statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create
   regulations, which are published in the Federal Register and codified
   into the Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations generally also carry
   the force of law under the Chevron doctrine. Many lawsuits turn on the
   meaning of a federal statute or regulation, and judicial
   interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle
   of stare decisis.

   During the 18th and 19th centuries, federal law traditionally focused
   on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal
   government in the federal Constitution, like the military, money,
   foreign affairs (especially international treaties), tariffs,
   intellectual property (specifically patents and copyrights), and mail.
   Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the
   Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal
   law to expand into areas like aviation, telecommunications, railroads,
   pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks. In some areas, like
   aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a
   comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law, while in
   others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes
   (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts
   with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust,
   trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the
   federal and state levels that coexist with each other. In a handful of
   areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to
   regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see,
   e.g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act).

Statutes[edit]

   Main articles: United States Statutes at Large, List of United States
   federal legislation and United States Code
   The United States Code, the codification of federal statutory law

   After the President signs a bill into law (or Congress enacts it over
   his veto), it is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR)
   of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) where it is
   assigned a law number, and prepared for publication as a slip law.^[38]
   Public laws, but not private laws, are also given legal statutory
   citation by the OFR. At the end of each session of Congress, the slip
   laws are compiled into bound volumes called the United States Statutes
   at Large, and they are known as session laws. The Statutes at Large
   present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that
   they have been enacted.

   Public laws are incorporated into the United States Code, which is a
   codification of all general and permanent laws of the United States.
   The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law
   Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative
   supplements are published annually.^[39]^[40] The U.S. Code is arranged
   by subject matter, and it shows the present status of laws (with
   amendments already incorporated in the text) that have been amended on
   one or more occasions.

Regulations[edit]

   Main articles: Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations
   The Code of Federal Regulations, the codification of federal
   administrative law

   Congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to
   federal agencies. Often, Congress is simply too gridlocked to draft
   detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every
   possible situation, or Congress believes the agency's technical
   specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations
   as they arise. Therefore, federal agencies are authorized to promulgate
   regulations. Under the principle of Chevron deference, regulations
   normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a
   reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes.

   Regulations are adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.
   Regulations are first proposed and published in the Federal Register
   (FR or Fed. Reg.) and subject to a public comment period. Eventually,
   after a period for public comment and revisions based on comments
   received, a final version is published in the Federal Register. The
   regulations are codified and incorporated into the Code of Federal
   Regulations (CFR) which is published once a year on a rolling schedule.

   Besides regulations formally promulgated under the APA, federal
   agencies also frequently promulgate an enormous amount of forms,
   manuals, policy statements, letters, and rulings. These documents may
   be considered by a court as persuasive authority as to how a particular
   statute or regulation may be interpreted (known as Skidmore deference),
   but are not entitled to Chevron deference.

Common law, case law and precedent[edit]

   The United States Reports, the official reporter of the Supreme Court
   of the United States
   Further information: United States Reports and National Reporter System

   Unlike the situation with the states, there is no plenary reception
   statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby
   granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like
   their English predecessors. Federal courts are solely creatures of the
   federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts.^[41] However, it
   is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States,
   by vesting "judicial power" into the Supreme Court and the inferior
   federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution,
   thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts
   to formulate persuasive precedent; this power was widely accepted,
   understood, and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the
   Constitution was ratified.^[42] Several legal scholars have argued that
   the federal judicial power to decide "cases or controversies"
   necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of
   those cases and controversies.^[43]

   The difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to
   formulating binding precedent through strict adherence to the rule of
   stare decisis. This is where the act of deciding a case becomes a
   limited form of lawmaking in itself, in that an appellate court's
   rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases (and
   therefore also impliedly binds all persons within the court's
   jurisdiction). Prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007,
   about one-fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby
   became binding precedents, while the rest were unpublished and bound
   only the parties to each case.^[42]

   As federal judge Alex Kozinski has pointed out, binding precedent as we
   know it today simply did not exist at the time the Constitution was
   framed.^[42] Judicial decisions were not consistently, accurately, and
   faithfully reported on both sides of the Atlantic (reporters often
   simply rewrote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked), and
   the United Kingdom lacked a coherent court hierarchy prior to the end
   of the 19th century.^[42] Furthermore, English judges in the eighteenth
   century subscribed to now-obsolete natural law theories of law, by
   which law was believed to have an existence independent of what
   individual judges said. Judges saw themselves as merely declaring the
   law which had always theoretically existed, and not as making the
   law.^[42] Therefore, a judge could reject another judge's opinion as
   simply an incorrect statement of the law, in the way that scientists
   regularly reject each other's conclusions as incorrect statements of
   the laws of science.^[42]

   In turn, according to Kozinski's analysis, the contemporary rule of
   binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century
   only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy (under the Judiciary
   Acts), and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S.
   appellate decisions by West Publishing.^[42] The rule gradually
   developed, case-by-case, as an extension of the judiciary's public
   policy of effective judicial administration (that is, in order to
   efficiently exercise the judicial power).^[42] The rule of precedent is
   generally justified today as a matter of public policy, first, as a
   matter of fundamental fairness, and second, because in the absence of
   case law, it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in
   every legal case to be briefed, argued, and decided from first
   principles (such as relevant statutes, constitutional provisions, and
   underlying public policies), which in turn would create hopeless
   inefficiency, instability, and unpredictability, and thereby undermine
   the rule of law.^[44]^[45]

   Here is a typical exposition of that public policy in a 2008 majority
   opinion signed by Associate Justice Stephen Breyer:

     Justice Brandeis once observed that "in most matters it is more
     important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be
     settled right." Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co. [...] To overturn a
     decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe
     that decision is no longer "right" would inevitably reflect a
     willingness to reconsider others. And that willingness could itself
     threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for
     necessary legal stability. We have not found here any factors that
     might overcome these considerations.^[46]

   It is now sometimes possible, over time, for a line of precedents to
   drift from the express language of any underlying statutory or
   constitutional texts until the courts' decisions establish doctrines
   that were not considered by the texts' drafters. This trend has been
   strongly evident in federal substantive due process^[47] and Commerce
   Clause decisions.^[48] Originalists and political conservatives, such
   as Associate Justice Antonin Scalia have criticized this trend as
   anti-democratic.^[49]^[50]^[51]

   Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), there is no
   general federal common law. Although federal courts can create federal
   common law in the form of case law, such law must be linked one way or
   another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional
   provision, statute, or regulation (which in turn was enacted as part of
   the Constitution or after). Federal courts lack the plenary power
   possessed by state courts to simply make up law, which the latter are
   able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions
   replacing the common law. Only in a few narrow limited areas, like
   maritime law,^[52] has the Constitution expressly authorized the
   continuation of English common law at the federal level (meaning that
   in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit,
   subject to the limitations of stare decisis).

   The other major implication of the Erie doctrine is that federal courts
   cannot dictate the content of state law when there is no federal issue
   (and thus no federal supremacy issue) in a case. When hearing claims
   under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, federal trial
   courts must apply the statutory and decisional law of the state in
   which they sit, as if they were a court of that state,^[53] even if
   they believe that the relevant state law is irrational or just bad
   public policy.^[54] And under Erie, deference is one-way only: state
   courts are not bound by federal interpretations of state law.^[55]

   Although judicial interpretations of federal law from the federal
   district and intermediate appellate courts hold great persuasive
   weight, state courts are not bound to follow those
   interpretations.^[56] There is only one federal court that binds all
   state courts as to the interpretation of federal law and the federal
   Constitution: the U.S. Supreme Court itself.^[57]

State law[edit]

   Volumes of the Thomson West annotated version of the California Penal
   Code, the codification of criminal law in the state of California
   Main article: State law (United States)

   The fifty American states are separate sovereigns,^[58] with their own
   state constitutions, state governments, and state courts. All states
   have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive
   branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory
   authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and
   occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as
   local ordinances. They retain plenary power to make laws covering
   anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes,
   or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally,
   state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions
   and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal
   issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
   Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari.^[59] State laws have
   dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the
   extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as
   to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but
   must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law, family law,
   property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on.^[60]

   Most cases are litigated in state courts and involve claims and
   defenses under state laws.^[61]^[62] In a 2012 report, the National
   Center for State Courts' Court Statistics Project found that state
   trial courts received 103.5 million newly filed cases in 2010, which
   consisted of 56.3 million traffic cases, 20.4 million criminal cases,
   19.0 million civil cases, 5.9 million domestic relations cases, and 1.9
   million juvenile cases.^[63] In 2010, state appellate courts received
   272,795 new cases.^[64] By way of comparison, all federal district
   courts in 2010 together received only about 282,000 new civil cases,
   77,000 new criminal cases, and 1.5 million bankruptcy cases, while
   federal appellate courts received 56,000 new cases.^[65]

Local law[edit]

   States have delegated lawmaking powers to thousands of agencies,
   townships, counties, cities, and special districts. And all the state
   constitutions, statutes and regulations (as well as all the ordinances
   and regulations promulgated by local entities) are subject to judicial
   interpretation like their federal counterparts.^[66]

   It is common for residents of major U.S. metropolitan areas to live
   under six or more layers of special districts as well as a town or
   city, and a county or township (in addition to the federal and state
   governments).^[67] Thus, at any given time, the average American
   citizen is subject to the rules and regulations of several dozen
   different agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, depending
   upon one's current location and behavior.

Types of law[edit]

Procedural law[edit]

   Traditionally, lawyers distinguish between procedural law (which
   controls the procedure followed by courts and parties to legal cases)
   and substantive law (the actual substance, or principles of law, which
   is what most people think of as law).^[68] In turn, procedural law is
   divided into criminal procedure and civil procedure.^[68]

Criminal procedure[edit]

   The law of criminal procedure in the United States consists of a
   massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the
   federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the
   creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems
   as well as the proceedings in criminal trials. Due to the perennial
   inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would
   actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional
   rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary
   gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such
   rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made
   remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most
   famous is the Miranda warning. The writ of habeas corpus is often used
   by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention, while the Civil
   Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover
   tort damages for police brutality.

Civil procedure[edit]

   Main article: Civil procedure in the United States

   The law of civil procedure governs process in all judicial proceedings
   involving lawsuits between private parties. Traditional common law
   pleading was replaced by code pleading in 24 states after New York
   enacted the Field Code in 1850 and code pleading in turn was
   subsequently replaced again in most states by modern notice pleading
   during the 20th century. The old English division between common law
   and equity courts was abolished in the federal courts by the adoption
   of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938; it has also been
   independently abolished by legislative acts in nearly all states. The
   Delaware Court of Chancery is the most prominent of the small number of
   remaining equity courts.

   Thirty-five states have adopted rules of civil procedure modeled after
   the FRCP (including rule numbers). However, in doing so, they had to
   make some modifications to account for the fact that state courts have
   broad general jurisdiction while federal courts have relatively limited
   jurisdiction.

   New York, Illinois, and California are the most significant states that
   have not adopted the FRCP. Furthermore, all three states continue to
   maintain most of their civil procedure laws in the form of codified
   statutes enacted by the state legislature, as opposed to court rules
   promulgated by the state supreme court, on the ground that the latter
   are undemocratic. But certain key portions of their civil procedure
   laws have been modified by their legislatures to bring them closer to
   federal civil procedure.^[69]

   Generally, American civil procedure has several notable features,
   including extensive pretrial discovery, heavy reliance on live
   testimony obtained at deposition or elicited in front of a jury, and
   aggressive pretrial "law and motion" practice designed to result in a
   pretrial disposition (that is, summary judgment) or a settlement. U.S.
   courts pioneered the concept of the opt-out class action, by which the
   burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish
   to be bound by the judgment, as opposed to opt-in class actions, where
   class members must join into the class. Another unique feature is the
   so-called American Rule under which parties generally bear their own
   attorneys' fees (as opposed to the English Rule of "loser pays"),
   though American legislators and courts have carved out numerous
   exceptions.

Substantive law[edit]

   Substantive law comprises the actual "substance" of the law; that is,
   the law that defines legally enforceable rights and duties, and what
   wrongful acts amount to violations of those rights and duties. Because
   substantive law by definition is enormous, the following summary
   briefly covers only a few highlights of each of the major components of
   American substantive law.

Criminal law[edit]

   Main article: Criminal law of the United States

   Criminal law involves the prosecution by the state of wrongful acts
   which are considered to be so serious that they are a breach of the
   sovereign's peace (and cannot be deterred or remedied by mere lawsuits
   between private parties). Generally, crimes can result in
   incarceration, but torts (see below) cannot. The majority of the crimes
   committed in the United States are prosecuted and punished at the state
   level. Federal criminal law focuses on areas specifically relevant to
   the federal government like evading payment of federal income tax, mail
   theft, or physical attacks on federal officials, as well as interstate
   crimes like drug trafficking and wire fraud.

   All states have somewhat similar laws in regard to "higher crimes" (or
   felonies), such as murder and rape, although penalties for these crimes
   may vary from state to state. Capital punishment is permitted in some
   states but not others. Three strikes laws in certain states impose
   harsh penalties on repeat offenders.

   Some states distinguish between two levels: felonies and misdemeanors
   (minor crimes). Generally, most felony convictions result in lengthy
   prison sentences as well as subsequent probation, large fines, and
   orders to pay restitution directly to victims; while misdemeanors may
   lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial fine. To simplify the
   prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor crimes,
   some states have added a third level, infractions. These may result in
   fines and sometimes the loss of one's driver's license, but no jail
   time.

   For public welfare offenses where the state is punishing merely risky
   (as opposed to injurious) behavior, there is significant diversity
   across the various states. For example, punishments for drunk driving
   varied greatly prior to 1990. State laws dealing with drug crimes still
   vary widely, with some states treating possession of small amounts of
   drugs as a misdemeanor offense or as a medical issue and others
   categorizing the same offense as a serious felony.

Contract law[edit]

   The Uniform Commercial Code
   Main article: United States contract law

   Contract law covers obligations established by agreement (express or
   implied) between private parties. Generally, contract law in
   transactions involving the sale of goods has become highly standardized
   nationwide as a result of the widespread adoption of the Uniform
   Commercial Code. However, there is still significant diversity in the
   interpretation of other kinds of contracts, depending upon the extent
   to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or
   adopted portions of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

   Parties are permitted to agree to arbitrate disputes arising from their
   contracts. Under the Federal Arbitration Act (which has been
   interpreted to cover all contracts arising under federal or state law),
   arbitration clauses are generally enforceable unless the party
   resisting arbitration can show unconscionability or fraud or something
   else which undermines the entire contract.

Tort law[edit]

   Main article: United States tort law
   The Restatement (Second) of Torts, a highly influential restatement of
   United States tort law

   Tort law generally covers any civil action between private parties
   arising from wrongful acts which amount to a breach of general
   obligations imposed by law and not by contract.

   Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans
   can inflict upon each other, and of course, partially overlaps with
   wrongs also punishable by criminal law. Although the American Law
   Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development
   of several versions of the Restatement of Torts, many states have
   chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject
   others. Thus, because of its immense size and diversity, American tort
   law cannot be easily summarized.

   For example, a few jurisdictions allow actions for negligent infliction
   of emotional distress even in the absence of physical injury to the
   plaintiff, but most do not. For any particular tort, states differ on
   the causes of action, types and scope of remedies, statutes of
   limitations, and the amount of specificity with which one must plead
   the cause. With practically any aspect of tort law, there is a
   "majority rule" adhered to by most states, and one or more "minority
   rules."

   Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century
   American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective
   products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of
   warranty. In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California
   threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict
   liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the
   landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products.^[70] The American Law
   Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the
   Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,
   which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the
   United States.^[71] Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the
   European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July
   1985^[72] by Australia in July 1992^[73] and by Japan in June
   1994.^[74]

   By the 1990s, the avalanche of American cases resulting from Greenman
   and Section 402A had become so complicated that another restatement was
   needed, which occurred with the 1997 publication of the Restatement
   (Third) of Torts: Products Liability.^[75]
