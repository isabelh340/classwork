   Elections to the United States House of Representatives for the 1st
   Congress were held in 1788 and 1789, coinciding with the election of
   George Washington as first President of the United States. The dates
   and methods of election were set by the states. Actual political
   parties did not yet exist, but new members of Congress were informally
   categorized as either "pro-Administration" (i.e., pro-Washington and
   pro-Hamilton) or "anti-Administration".

   The first session of the first House of Representatives came to order
   in Federal Hall, New York City on March 4, 1789, with only thirteen
   members present. The requisite quorum (thirty members out of
   fifty-nine) was not present until April 1, 1789. The first order of
   business was the election of a Speaker of the House. On the first
   ballot, Frederick Muhlenberg was elected Speaker by a majority of
   votes. The business of the first session was largely devoted to
   legislative procedure rather than policy.

Election summaries[edit]

   In the 18th and much of the 19th century, each state set its own date
   for elections. In many years, elections were even held after the legal
   start of the Congress, although typically before the start of the first
   session. In the elections for the 1st Congress, five states held
   elections in 1788, electing a total of 29 Representatives, and six held
   elections in 1789, electing a total of 30 seats. Two states, North
   Carolina and Rhode Island, did not ratify the Constitution until
   November 21, 1789 and May 29, 1790 respectively, well after the
   Congress had met for the first time, and, consequently, elected
   representatives late, in 1790, leaving North Carolina unrepresented in
   the 1st session and Rhode Island in the 1st and 2nd sessions of a total
   of 3 sessions.

   ratified the Constitution late. One pro-Administration representative
   resigned and the seat remained open at the end of the Congress.

   At the time, Maryland had a mixed district/at-large system similar to

   had to be residents of a specific district with the statewide vote
   determining winners from each district."^[10]

   if no one won a majority. This was necessary in 4 of the districts.

New Hampshire[edit]

   New Hampshire electoral law required a candidate to receive votes from
   a majority of voters for election (16.7% of votes). No candidate won
   such a majority on the first ballot, so a second election had to be
   held, on February 2, 1789

   The election of all four representatives was contested, but the records
   that explaing the precise grounds on which the election was contested
   have been lost due to the burning of Washington in the War of 1812. It
   is known to have related to questions of regularity and procedure. All
   four representatives' elections were ruled valid.^[13]

   For this first election (and again in 1792 election for the 3rd
   Congress), Pennsylvania chose to elect all of its representatives on a
