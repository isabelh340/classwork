   The United States dollar (sign: $; code: USD; also abbreviated US $) is
   referred to as the U.S. dollar, American dollar, US Dollar or Federal
   Reserve Note. It is the official currency of the United States and its
   overseas territories. It is divided into 100 smaller units called
   cents.

   The U.S. dollar is fiat money. It is the currency most used in
   international transactions and is the world's most dominant reserve
   currency.^[17] Several countries use it as their official currency, and
   in many others it is the de facto currency.^[18] It is also used as the
   sole currency in two British Overseas Territories: the British Virgin
   Islands and the Turks and Caicos islands.

Overview[edit]

   The Constitution of the United States of America provides that the
   United States Congress has the power "To coin money".^[19] Laws
   implementing this power are currently codified in Section 5112 of Title
   31 of the United States Code. Section 5112 prescribes the forms, in
   which the United States dollars should be issued.^[20] These coins are
   both designated in Section 5112 as "legal tender" in payment of
   debts.^[20] The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy
   dollar. The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle.
   Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins,
   which have values ranging from one cent to fifty dollars.^[20] These
   other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States
   dollar.

   The Constitution provides that "a regular Statement and Account of the
   Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from
   time to time".^[21] That provision of the Constitution is made specific
   by Section 331 of Title 31 of the United States Code.^[22] The sums of
   money reported in the "Statements" are currently being expressed in
   U.S. dollars (for example, see the 2009 Financial Report of the United
   States Government).^[23] The U.S. dollar may therefore be described as
   the unit of account of the United States.

   The word "dollar" is one of the words in the first paragraph of Section
   9 of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. In that context, "dollars" is
   a reference to the Spanish milled dollar, a coin that had a monetary
   value of 8 Spanish units of currency, or reales. In 1792 the U.S.
   Congress adopted legislation titled An act establishing a mint, and
   regulating the Coins of the United States. Section 9 of that act
   authorized the production of various coins, including "DOLLARS OR
   UNITS—each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is
   now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and
   four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen
   grains of standard silver". Section 20 of the act provided, "That the
   money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars, or
   units... and that all accounts in the public offices and all
   proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in
   conformity to this regulation". In other words, this act designated the
   United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States.

   Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a
   decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act
   officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a
   dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime
   or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed
   weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was
   proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union,
   but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half
   union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of
   the dollar; "dime" is used solely as the name of the coin with the
   value of 10¢, while "eagle" and "mill" are largely unknown to the
   general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax
   levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per
   gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.59^9⁄[10]. When currently
   issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a
   dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or
   greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the
   exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal
   tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes
   are produced today, although the note form is significantly more
   common. In the past, "paper money" was occasionally issued in
   denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins
   were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the
   "double eagle", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in
   the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and
   subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than
   one dollar in denomination, known as "fractional currency", was also
   sometimes pejoratively referred to as "shinplasters". In 1854, James
   Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50
   and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a "Union", "Half Union",
   and "Quarter Union",^[24] thus implying a denomination of 1 Union =
   $100.

   Today, USD notes are made from cotton fiber paper, unlike most common
   paper, which is made of wood fiber. U.S. coins are produced by the
   United States Mint. U.S. dollar banknotes are printed by the Bureau of
   Engraving and Printing and, since 1914, have been issued by the Federal
   Reserve. The "large-sized notes" issued before 1928 measured 7.42
   inches (188 mm) by 3.125 inches (79.4 mm); small-sized notes,
   introduced that year, measure 6.14 inches (156 mm) by 2.61 inches
   (66 mm) by 0.0043 inches (0.11 mm). When the current, smaller sized
   U.S. currency was introduced it was referred to as Philippine-sized
   currency because the Philippines had previously adopted the same size
   for its legal currency.

Etymology[edit]

   Further information: Dollar

   In the 16th century, Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting
   coins known as Joachimstalers (from German thal, or nowadays usually
   Tal, "valley", cognate with "dale" in English), named for Joachimstal,
   the valley where the silver was mined (St. Joachim's Valley, now
   Jáchymov; then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, now part of the Czech
   Republic).^[25] Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler,
   a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler,
   Dutch as daler or daalder, Ethiopian as ታላሪ (talari), Hungarian as
   tallér, Italian as tallero, and English as dollar.^[25] Alternatively,
   thaler is said to come from the German coin Guldengroschen ("great
   guilder", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted
   from the silver from Joachimsthal.

   The coins minted at Joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of
   similar size and weight from other places. One such example, was a
   Dutch coin depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name leeuwendaler (English
   lion daler).

   The leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .750 fine
   silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 stuivers. It was
   lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, thus it
   was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in
   leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.

   The leeuwendaler was popular in the Dutch East Indies and in the Dutch
   New Netherland Colony (New York), and circulated throughout the
   Thirteen Colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also
   popular throughout Eastern Europe, where it led to the current Romanian
   and Moldovan currency being called leu(literally "lion").

   Among the English-speaking community, the coin came to be popularly
   known as lion dollar – and is the origin of the name dollar.^[26] The
   modern American-English pronunciation of dollar is still remarkably
   close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of daler.^[27]

   By analogy with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos – with the same weight
   and shape as the lion dollar – came to be known as Spanish
   dollars.^[27] By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been
   replaced by the Spanish dollar, the famous "piece of eight", which was
   distributed widely in the Spanish colonies in the New World and in the
   Philippines.^[28] Eventually, dollar became the name of the first
   official American currency.

   The colloquialism "buck" (much like the British word "quid" for the
   pound sterling) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations,
   including the U.S. dollar. This term, dating to the 18th century, may
   have originated with the colonial leather trade. It may also have
   originated from a poker term.^[29] "Greenback" is another nickname
   originally applied specifically to the 19th century Demand Note dollars
   created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the Civil War for
   the North.^[30] The original note was printed in black and green on the
   back side. It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the
   dollars of other countries). Other well-known names of the dollar as a
   whole in denominations include "greenmail", "green" and "dead
   presidents" (the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most
   bills).

   A "grand", sometimes shortened to simply "G", is a common term for the
   amount of $1,000. The suffix "K" or "k" (from "kilo-") is also commonly
   used to denote this amount (such as "$10k" to mean $10,000). A "large"
   or "stack", it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as
   "fifty large" meaning $50,000). The $100 bill is nicknamed "Benjamin",
   "Ben", or "Franklin" (after Benjamin Franklin), "C-note" (C being the
   Roman numeral for 100), "Century note" or "bill" (e.g. "two bills"
   being $200). The $20 bill is referred to as "double sawbuck", "Jackson"
   (after Andrew Jackson), or "double eagle". The $10 bill—as "sawbuck",
   "ten-spot" or "Hamilton" (after Alexander Hamilton). The $5 bill as
   "fin", "fiver" or "five-spot". The $2 bill is sometimes called "deuce",
   "Tom", or "Jefferson" (after Thomas Jefferson). The $1 bill as a
   "single" or "buck". The dollar has also been referred to as a "bone"
   and "bones" in plural (e.g. "twenty bones" is equal to $20). The newer
   designs are sometimes referred to as "Bigface" bills or "Monopoly
   money".

   In French-speaking areas of Louisiana, the dollar is referred to as
   "piastre" or "piasse" (pronounced "pee-as") and the French holdover
   "sou" (pronounced "soo") is used to refer to the cent.

   In El Salvador, the dollar replaced the Salvadoran colón under the
   presidency of Francisco Flores Pérez.

   In Panama, the equivalent of buck is "palo" (literally "stick"). Also,
   the Panamanian balboa is directly tied to the U.S. dollar, and US
   dollars are frequently used in place of the minted Panamanian currency.

   In Ecuador, the dollar is referred to as "plata" (literally "silver").

   In Peru, a nickname for the U.S. dollar is "coco", which is a pet name
   for Jorge ("George" in Spanish), a reference to the portrait of George
   Washington on the $1 note.

   Puerto Ricans, both living in Puerto Rico and in the United States, may
   refer to the dollar as "peso".

   In some places in Mexico, prices in U.S. dollars are referred to as "en
   americano" ("in American") or en oro ("in gold"), with the word "peso"
   used in Mexico primarily to refer to the Mexican peso.

   Cubans call the U.S. dollar "fula", loosely translated from Cuban
   jargon meaning bad. Possession of American money was penalized before
   the mid-1990s, hence the nickname.

Dollar sign[edit]

   Main article: Dollar sign
   Silver real of 1768

   The symbol $, usually written before the numerical amount, is used for
   the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies). The sign was
   the result of a late 18th-century evolution of the scribal abbreviation
   "p^s" for the peso. The p and the s eventually came to be written over
   each other giving rise to $.^[31]^[32]^[33]^[34]

   Another popular explanation is that it comes from the Pillars of
   Hercules on the Spanish Coat of arms on the Spanish dollars that were
   minted in the New World mints in Mexico City, Mexico; Potosí, Bolivia;
   and Lima, Peru. These Pillars of Hercules on the silver Spanish dollar
   coins take the form of two vertical bars (||) and a swinging cloth band
   in the shape of an "S".

   Yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from
   the capital letters U and S written or printed one on top of the other.
   This theory, popularized by novelist Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged,^[35]
   does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before
   the formation of the United States.^[36]

History[edit]

   See also: History of the United States dollar
   Obverse of rare 1934 $500 Federal Reserve Note, featuring a portrait of
   President William McKinley.
   Reverse of a $500 Federal Reserve Note.

   The first dollar coins issued by the United States Mint (founded 1792)
   were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar. The
   Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and Mexican silver pesos circulated side
   by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso
   remained legal tender until 1857. The coinage of various English
   colonies also circulated. The lion dollar was popular in the Dutch New
   Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated
   throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th
   century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that
   the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes
   referred to as "dog dollars".^[37]

   The U.S. dollar was created by the Constitution and defined by the
   Coinage Act of 1792. It specified a "dollar" to be based in the Spanish
   milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of
   pure or 416 grains (27.0 g) of standard silver and an "eagle" to be 247
   and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains (17 g) of gold (again depending
   on purity).^[38] The choice of the value 371 grains arose from
   Alexander Hamilton's decision to base the new American unit on the
   average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the
   treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight
   came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377
   grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount
   in relation to the Spanish dollar.

   The Coinage Act of 1792 set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and
   the dollar at 1/10 eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in
   denominations of 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/10, and 1/20 dollars; it called for 90%
   gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/10 eagles.

   The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted
   into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods.
   This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time,
   except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's
   economy.

   The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of
   presidents, as is the custom now;^[39] although today, by law, only the
   portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States
   currency.^[40] In fact, the newly formed government was against having
   portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the
   policies of European monarchs.^[41] The currency as we know it today
   did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th
   century; before that "heads" side of coinage used profile faces and
   striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology
   and composite native Americans. The last coins to be converted to
   profiles of historic Americans were the dime (1946) and the Dollar
   (1971).

   pound, North Carolina pound, Pennsylvania pound, Rhode Island pound,
   South Carolina pound and Virginia pound.

Continental currency[edit]

   See also: Continental currency
   Continental One Third Dollar Bill (obverse)

   In 1775, the United States and the individual states began issuing
   "Continental Currency" denominated in Spanish dollars and (for the
   issues of the states) the £sd currencies of the states. The dollar was
   valued relative to the states' currencies at the following rates:
   State Value of Dollar
   in State Currency
   Georgia 5 Shillings
   Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Virginia 6
   Shillings
   Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania 7½ Shillings
   New York, North Carolina 8 Shillings
   South Carolina 32½ Shillings

   The continental currency suffered from printing press inflation and was
   replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar = 1000
   continental dollars.

Silver and gold standards[edit]

   Question book-new.svg

   From 1792, when the Mint Act was passed, the dollar was defined as
   371.25 grains (24.056 g) of silver. Many historians^[who?] erroneously
   assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver;
   however, there is no evidence of Congress making this law. This has to
   do with Alexander Hamilton's suggestion to Congress of a fixed 15:1
   ratio of silver to gold, respectively. The gold coins that were minted
   however, were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a
   market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver
   dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains (1.50 g),
   followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains (1.505 g) in 1837 (16:1
   ratio).^[citation needed]

   In 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals,
   due to the Civil War. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and
   in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This
   disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the War
   of 1812. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also
   occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no
   solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly
   lost their value, giving rise to the phrase "not worth a continental".
   This was a primary reason for the "No state shall... make any thing but
   gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts" clause in article 1,
   section 10 of the United States Constitution.

   The Gold Standard Act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and
   defined the dollar as 23.22 grains (1.505 g) of gold, equivalent to
   setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $20.67. Silver coins
   continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was
   removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40%
   silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970.
   Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by
   Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains
   (0.888 g), equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at
   $35. This standard persisted until 1968.

   Between 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place,
   eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971 to the
   convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the Nixon Shock. The
   last peg was $42.22 per ounce^[citation needed] before the U.S. dollar
   was let to freely float on currency markets.

   According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the largest note it
   ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These
   notes were printed from December 18, 1934 through January 9, 1935, and
   were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve
   Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the
   Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal
   Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.

   Technically, all these coins are still legal tender at face value,
   though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value, and
   for gold and silver coins, their precious metal value. From 1965 to
   1970 the Kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any
   silver content though the Mint still makes what it calls Silver Proof
   sets for collectors.

   In addition, an experimental $4.00 (Stella) coin was also minted, but
   never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a
   pattern rather than an actual coin denomination.

   The $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the Panama-Pacific
   International Exposition (1915) celebrating the opening of the Panama
   Canal. Only 1,128 were made, 645 of which were octagonal; this remains
   the only U.S. coin that was not round as well as the largest and
   heaviest U.S. coin ever.

   From 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation
   have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar and
   dollar. The nickel is the only coin still in use today that is
   essentially unchanged (except in its design) from its original version.
   Every year since 1866, the nickel has been 75% copper and 25% nickel,
   except for 4 years during World War II when nickel was needed for the
   war.

Collector coins[edit]

   The United States Mint produces Proof Sets specifically for collectors
   and speculators. Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with
   the dime, quarter, half dollar, and in some cases the dollar having
   silver content. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar
   Proof Set where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a
   president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of
   these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential
   dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 11, 2011, by
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Future minting of such
   coins will be made solely for collectors.^[43]

   Flowing Hair Dollar

   The first United States dollar was minted in 1794. Known as the Flowing
   Hair Dollar, it contained 416 grains of "standard silver" (89.25%
   silver and 10.75% copper), as specified by Section 13^[44] of the
   Coinage Act of 1792. It was designated by Section 9 of that Act as
   having "the value of a Spanish milled dollar".

   Dollar coins have not been very popular in the United States.^[45]
   Silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a
   copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President Dwight
   D. Eisenhower, was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were
   also minted in the 19th century. The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was
   introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were
   often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their
   milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for
   circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in
   1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain legal tender. As
   the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed
   primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had
   been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in
   1999. In 2000, a new $1 coin, featuring Sacagawea, (the Sacagawea
   dollar) was introduced, which corrected some of the mistakes of the
   Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without
   requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar.
   However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the
   still-existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The
   failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity
   efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the
   failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.^[46]

   In February 2007, the U.S. Mint, under the Presidential $1 Coin Act of
   2005,^[47] introduced a new $1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin. Based on
   the success of the "50 State Quarters" series, the new coin features a
   sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with
   George Washington, on the obverse side. The reverse side features the
   Statue of Liberty. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the
   traditional inscriptions of "E Pluribus Unum", "In God We Trust", the
   year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the
   edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge
   inscriptions seen on the British £1 coin, is not usually associated
   with U.S. coin designs. The inscription "Liberty" has been eliminated,
   with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In
   addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time
   there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with
   the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side (Lincoln/penny,
   Jefferson/nickel, Franklin D. Roosevelt/dime, Washington/quarter,
   Kennedy/half dollar, and Eisenhower/dollar). Another unusual fact about
   the new $1 coin is Grover Cleveland will have two coins with his
   portrait issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be
   elected to two non-consecutive terms.^[48]

   Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped
   primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks.
   Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each
   within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the
   absence of the edge impressions "E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007
   P". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia,
   although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a
   mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in
   both orientations with respect to "heads", some amateur collectors were
   initially duped into buying "upside down lettering error" coins.^[49]
   Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes
   more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out
   in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this
   argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes,
   which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to
   the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying
   the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change
   in banknotes, they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will
   give change in dollar coins.

Mint marks[edit]

   Mint Mint mark Metal Minted Year Established Current Status
   Denver D All metals 1906 Still in operation
   Philadelphia None, see note 1 1792 Still in operation
   San Francisco S All metals 1854 Still in operation (proof coins, only)
   New Orleans O Gold and Silver 1838 Closed in 1861, reopened in 1879,
   closed in 1909, see note 2
   Carson City CC Gold and Silver 1870 Closed in 1893, see note 3

   Charlotte C Gold only 1838 Closed in 1861
   West Point W see note 5 Gold, Silver and Platinum 1973 Still in
   operation

   Note 1: From 1942 to 1945 the letter "P" was used for the Philadelphia
   mint mark on Jefferson nickels (using the silver content), from 1980 on
   the letter "P" was used for the Philadelphia mint mark on a permanent
   basis (except Lincoln pennies).

   Note 2: During the Civil War, this mint operated under the control of
   the State of Louisiana (February 1861) and the Confederate States of
   America (March 1861) until it ran out of bullion later in that year;
   some Half Dollars have been identified as being the issue of the State
   of Louisiana and the Confederacy.

   Note 3: Press Number 1 is still in use by the Nevada State Museum; it
   produces tokens for the Reno Coin Club.

   Note 4: Although the mint mark "D" is used for two separate mints, it
   is easy to distinguish between the two; any antebellum coinage (up to
   1861) is Dahlonega, and any 20th century or later coinage is Denver.

   Note 5: Between 1973 and 1986 there was no mint mark; these coins are
   indistinguishable from coins produced at the Philadelphia Mint (note 1
   notwithstanding): after 1988 the letter "W" was used for coinage
   (except for the 2009 Ultra High Relief Double Eagle).

   The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to
   "borrow money on the credit of the United States".^[50] Congress has
   exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue
   Federal Reserve Notes. Those notes are "obligations of the United
   States" and "shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the
   Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington,
   District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank".^[51] Federal
   Reserve Notes are designated by law as "legal tender" for the payment
   of debts.^[52] Congress has also authorized the issuance of more than
   10 other types of banknotes, including the United States Note^[53] and
   the Federal Reserve Bank Note. The Federal Reserve Note is the only
   type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.

   Currently printed denominations are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and
   $100. Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946
   and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes
   were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime;
   it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue
   an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of
   electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations
   of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and $100,000 were all produced at one
   time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. These
   notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face
   value to collectors.

   Though still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other
   colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a
   2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the American Council
   of the Blind, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is planning to
   implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note,
   except the $1 and the version of the $100 bill already in process. It
   also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences,
   and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired
   during the transition period.^[54]

Means of issue[edit]

   The monetary base consists of coins and Federal Reserve Notes in
   circulation outside the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury,
   plus deposits held by depository institutions at Federal Reserve Banks.
   The adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400 billion
   dollars in 1994, to 800 billion in 2005, and over 3000 billion in
   2013.^[55] The amount of cash in circulation is increased (or
   decreased) by the actions of the Federal Reserve System. Eight times a
   year, the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee meet to determine US
   monetary policy.^[56] Every business day, the Federal Reserve System
   engages in Open market operations to carry out that monetary
   policy.^[57] If the Federal Reserve desires to increase the money
   supply, it will buy securities (such as US Treasury Bonds) anonymously
   from banks in exchange for dollars. Conversely, it will sell securities
   to the banks in exchange for dollars, to take dollars out of
   circulation.^[58]

   When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase, it credits the seller's
   reserve account (with the Federal Reserve). This money is not
   transferred from any existing funds—it is at this point that the
   Federal Reserve has created new high-powered money. Commercial banks
   can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve
   account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal
   Reserve places an order for printed money from the US Treasury
   Department.^[59] The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests
   to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to print new dollar bills) and
   the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).

   Usually, the short term goal of open market operations is to achieve a
   specific short term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary
   policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate
   relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For
   example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets
   the federal funds rate, the rate at which member banks lend to one
   another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary
   policy include: (i) Discount window lending (as lender of last resort);
   (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement);
   (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve
   specified outcomes); (iv) "Open mouth operations" (talking monetary
   policy with the market).

   The 6th paragraph of Section 8 of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution
   provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to "coin money"
   and to "regulate the value" of domestic and foreign coins. Congress
   exercised those powers when it enacted the Coinage Act of 1792. That
   Act provided for the minting of the first U.S. dollar and it declared
   that the U.S. dollar shall have "the value of a Spanish milled dollar
   as the same is now current".^[60]

   The table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that, in a
   particular year, could be purchased with $1. The table shows that from
   1774 through 2012 the U.S. dollar has lost about 97.0% of its buying
   power.^[61]

   The decline in the value of the U.S. dollar corresponds to price
   inflation, which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and
   services in an economy over a period of time.^[62] A consumer price
   index (CPI) is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods
   and services purchased by households. The United States Consumer Price
   Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a measure
   estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the
   United States.^[63] It reflects inflation as experienced by consumers
   in their day-to-day living expenses.^[64] A graph showing the U.S. CPI
   relative to 1982–1984 and the annual year-over-year change in CPI is
   shown at right.

   The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime,
   especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War
   II.^[65] The Federal Reserve, which was established in 1913, was
   designed to furnish an "elastic" currency subject to "substantial
   changes of quantity over short periods", which differed significantly
   from previous forms of high-powered money such as gold, national bank
   notes, and silver coins.^[66] Over the very long run, the prior gold
   standard kept prices stable—for instance, the price level and the value
   of the U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level
   in the 1880s. The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining
   the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability, reversing the
   inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of
   the dollar during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30% deflation in
   U.S. prices in the 1930s.^[67]

   Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II, the
   value of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce, and the value of the U.S.
   dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold. Rising government
   spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the
   United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as
   banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and
   as a result the value of the dollar began to decline. Facing an
   emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States
   would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold, gold convertibility
   was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon, resulting in the
   "Nixon shock".^[68]

   The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold,
   and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S.
   currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money
   supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the
   U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing
   economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were
   linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as
   relatively benign.^[68] Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two
   thirds of its value.^[61]

   In 1979, President Carter appointed Paul Volcker Chairman of the
   Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve tightened the money supply and
   inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s, and hence the value of
   the U.S. dollar stabilized.^[68]

   Over the thirty-year period from 1981 to 2009, the U.S. dollar lost
   over half its value.^[61] This is because the Federal Reserve has
   targeted not zero inflation, but a low, stable rate of
   inflation—between 1987 and 1997, the rate of inflation was
   approximately 3.5%, and between 1997 and 2007 it was approximately 2%.
   The so-called "Great Moderation" of economic conditions since the 1970s
   is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability.^[68]

   There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero
   inflation (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over
   time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but
   slowly declining value of the dollar over time, as is the case now).
   Although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and
   therefore a constant value for the U.S. dollar,^[67] others contend
   that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control
   interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.^[69]
