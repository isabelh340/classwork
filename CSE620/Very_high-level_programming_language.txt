Very high-level programming language

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   A very high-level programming language (VHLL) is a programming language
   with a very high level of abstraction, used primarily as a professional
   programmer productivity tool.

   Very high-level programming languages are usually domain-specific
   languages, limited to a very specific application, purpose, or type of
   task, and often scripting languages (especially extension languages),
   controlling a specific environment. For this reason, very high-level
   programming languages are often referred to as goal-oriented
   programming languages.

   An example of a very high-level programming language is the mIRC
   scripting language, which is designed to extend mIRC, a popular IRC
   client for Windows.

   The term VHLL was used in the 1990s for what are today more often
   called high-level languages (no "very"), such as Perl, Python, and
   Visual Basic.^[1]^[2]
