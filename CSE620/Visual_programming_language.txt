Visual programming language

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Scratch is a visual programming language aimed at new programmers

   In computing, a visual programming language (VPL) is any programming
   language that lets users create programs by manipulating program
   elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually. A VPL
   allows programming with visual expressions, spatial arrangements of
   text and graphic symbols, used either as elements of syntax or
   secondary notation. For example, many VPLs (known as dataflow or
   diagrammatic programming)^[1] are based on the idea of "boxes and
   arrows", where boxes or other screen objects are treated as entities,
   connected by arrows, lines or arcs which represent relations.

Definition[edit]

   VPLs may be further classified, according to the type and extent of
   visual expression used, into icon-based languages, form-based
   languages, and diagram languages. Visual programming environments
   provide graphical or iconic elements which can be manipulated by users
   in an interactive way according to some specific spatial grammar for
   program construction.

   A visually transformed language is a non-visual language with a
   superimposed visual representation. Naturally visual languages have an
   inherent visual expression for which there is no obvious textual
   equivalent.^[citation needed]

   Current developments try to integrate the visual programming approach
   with dataflow programming languages to either have immediate access to
   the program state resulting in online debugging or automatic program
   generation and documentation (i.e. visual paradigm). Dataflow languages
   also allow automatic parallelization, which is likely to become one of
   the greatest programming challenges of the future.^[2]

   An instructive counterexample for visual programming languages is the
   Microsoft Visual Studio. The languages it encompasses (Visual Basic,
   Visual C#, Visual J#, etc.) are commonly confused with, but are not
   visual programming languages. All of these languages are textual and
   not graphical. MS Visual Studio is a visual programming environment,
   but not a visual programming language, hence the confusion.

Visual language and interfaces[edit]

   This section is in a list format that may be better presented using
   prose. You can help by converting this section to prose, if
   appropriate. Editing help is available. (April 2014)
   This is an incomplete list that may never be able to satisfy particular
   standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with entries
