Symbolic programming

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   In computing, symbolic programming is computer programming in which the
   program can manipulate formulas and program components as data.^[1]

   Through symbolic programming, complex processes can be developed that
   build other more intricate processes by combining smaller units of
   logic or functionality. Programs can thus effectively modify
   themselves, and appear to "learn", making them suited for applications
   such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural language
   processing and computer games.

   Languages that support the symbolic programming paradigm include LISP
   and Prolog.^[2]
