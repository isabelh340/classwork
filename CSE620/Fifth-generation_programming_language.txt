   A fifth generation programming language (abbreviated as 5GL) is a
   programming language based on solving problems using constraints given
   to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer.
   Most constraint-based and logic programming languages and some
   declarative languages are fifth-generation languages.

   While fourth-generation programming languages are designed to build
   specific programs, fifth-generation languages are designed to make the
   computer solve a given problem without the programmer. This way, the
   programmer only needs to worry about what problems need to be solved
   and what conditions need to be met, without worrying about how to
   implement a routine or algorithm to solve them. Fifth-generation
   languages are used mainly in artificial intelligence research. Prolog,
   OPS5, and Mercury are examples of fifth-generation languages.^[citation
   needed]

   These types of languages were also built upon Lisp, many originating on
   the Lisp machine, such as ICAD. Then, there are many frame languages,
   such as KL-ONE.^[citation needed]

   In the 1980s, fifth-generation languages were considered to be the wave
   of the future, and some predicted that they would replace all other
   languages for system development, with the exception of low-level
   languages.^[citation needed] Most notably, from 1982 to 1993
   Japan^[1]^[2] put much research and money into their fifth generation
   computer systems project, hoping to design a massive computer network
   of machines using these tools.

   However, as larger programs were built, the flaws of the approach
   became more apparent. It turns out that, given a set of constraints
   defining a particular problem, deriving an efficient algorithm to solve
   it is a very difficult problem in itself. This crucial step cannot yet
   be automated and still requires the insight of a human
   programmer.^[citation needed]

Common misconception[edit]

   Vendors have been known on occasion to advertise their languages as
   5GL.^[3] Most of the time they actually sell 4GLs with a higher level
   of automation and knowledge base. Since the 5GL awareness has dropped
   because the hype of the 1980s quickly faded away and the projects were
   eventually all dropped; this has opened doors to the vendors to re-use
   the term in marketing their new tools, without causing much controversy
   among the current generations of programmers.^[citation needed]
