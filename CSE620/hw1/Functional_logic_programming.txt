   Functional logic programming is the combination, in a single
   programming language, of the paradigms of functional programming
   (including higher-order programming) and logic programming
   (non-deterministic programming, unification). This style of programming
   was pioneered in λProlog^[1] in the 1990s. Other, newer functional
   logic programming languages include Curry and Mercury.
