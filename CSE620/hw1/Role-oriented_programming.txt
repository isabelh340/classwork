   Role-oriented programming is a form of computer programming aimed at
   expressing things in terms which are analogous to human conceptual
   understanding of the world. This should make programs easier to
   understand and maintain.

   The main idea of role-oriented programming is that humans think in
   terms of roles. This claim is often backed up by examples of social
   relations. For example, a student attending a class and the same
   student at a party are the same person, yet he plays two different
   roles. In particular, the interactions of this person with the outside
   world depend on his current role. The roles typically share features,
   e.g., the intrinsic properties of being a person. This sharing of
   properties is often handled by the delegation mechanism.

   In the older literature and in the field of databases, it seems that
   there has been little consideration for the context in which roles
   interplay with each other. Such a context is being established in newer
   role- and aspect-oriented programming languages such as Object Teams.

   Many researchers have argued the advantages of roles in modeling and
   implementation. Roles allow objects to evolve over time, they enable
   independent and concurrently existing views (interfaces) of the object,
   explicating the different contexts of the object, and separating
   concerns. Generally roles are a natural element of our daily concept
   forming. Roles in programming languages enable objects to have changing
   interfaces, as we see it in real life - things change over time, are
   used differently in different contexts, etc.

   A complete overview and taxonomy of Role languages is provided in the
   Ph.D. thesis [1]
