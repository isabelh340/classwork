   Agent-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm where the
   construction of the software is centered on the concept of software
   agents. In contrast to object-oriented programming which has objects
   (providing methods with variable parameters) at its core, AOP has
   externally specified agents (with interfaces and messaging
   capabilities) at its core. They can be thought of as abstractions of
   objects. Exchanged messages are interpreted by receiving "agents", in a
   way specific to its class of agents.

History[edit]

   Historically the concept of Agent-oriented programming and the idea of
   centering your software around the concept of agent was first used by
   Yoav Shoham within his Artificial Intelligence studies, in
   1990.^[1]^[2] His agents are specific to his own paradigm as they have
   just one method, with a single parameter. To quote Yoav Shoham from his
   paper in 1990 for a basic difference between of AOP against OOP:

          ...agent-oriented programming (AOP), which can be viewed as a
          specialization of object-oriented programming. ...

   OOP AOP
   Basic unit object agent
   Parameters defining state of basic unit unconstrained beliefs,
   commitments, capabilities, choices....
   Process of computation message passing and response methods message
   passing and response methods
   Types of message unconstrained inform, request, offer, promise,
   decline....
   Constraints on methods none honesty, consistency....

Frameworks[edit]

   There are multiple AOP 'frameworks' also called Agent Platforms that
   implement Shoham's programming paradigm. The following examples
   illustrate how a basic agent is programmed as a Hello World Program.

JADE[edit]

   For the Java-platform one of the frameworks is JADE ^[3]
   (http://jade.tilab.com/). Here is a very basic example [1] of an Agent
   that runs code
package helloworld;
import jade.core.Agent;

public class Hello extends Agent {

        protected void setup() {
                System.out.println("Hello World. ");
                System.out.println("My name is "+ getLocalName());
        }

        public Hello() {
                System.out.println("Constructor called");
        }

}

   At the core of JADE's AOP model is that its API supports the standard
   FIPA Agent Communication Language

Agent Speak (Jason)[edit]

   For a literal translation of Agent Oriented concepts into a scheme
   unobfuscated as is JADE, behind Java and Object Orientedness, Agent
   Speak ^[4] (Jason) provides a "natural" language for agents.

        started.

        +started <- .print("Hello World. ").

Middleware[edit]

   One way to implement modular or extensible AOP support is to define
   standard AOP APIs to middleware functions that are themselves
   implemented as software agents. For example, a directory service can be
   implemented as a FIPA directory facilitator or DF software agent;
   life-cycle management to start, stop, suspend and resume agents can be
   implemented as a FIPA Agent Management Service or AMS agent.^[5] A
   benefit of the AOP approach is that it support more dynamic roles
   between different users and providers of applications, services and
   networks. For example, traditionally, networks and services were
   usually managed by the network and service provider on behalf of the
   customer and offered as a single virtual network service but customers
   themselves are becoming more empowered to integrate and manage their
   own services. This can be achieved via AOP and APIs to middleware
   agents that can flexibly and dynamically manage communication.^[6]
