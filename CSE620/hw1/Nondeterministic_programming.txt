   A nondeterministic programming language is a language which can
   specify, at certain points in the program (called "choice points"),
   various alternatives for program flow. Unlike an if-then statement, the
   method of choice between these alternatives is not directly specified
   by the programmer; the program must decide at run time between the
   alternatives, via some general method applied to all choice points. A
   programmer specifies a limited number of alternatives, but the program
   must later choose between them. ("Choose" is, in fact, a typical name
   for the nondeterministic operator.) A hierarchy of choice points may be
   formed, with higher-level choices leading to branches that contain
   lower-level choices within them.

   One method of choice is embodied in backtracking systems (such as AMB,
   or unification in Prolog), in which some alternatives may "fail,"
   causing the program to backtrack and try other alternatives. If all
   alternatives fail at a particular choice point, then an entire branch
   fails, and the program will backtrack further, to an older choice
   point. One complication is that, because any choice is tentative and
   may be remade, the system must be able to restore old program states by
   undoing side-effects caused by partially executing a branch that
   eventually failed.

   Another method of choice is reinforcement learning, embodied in systems
   such as Alisp. In such systems, rather than backtracking, the system
   keeps track of some measure of success and learns which choices often
   lead to success, and in which situations (both internal program state
   and environmental input may affect the choice). These systems are
   suitable for applications to robotics and other domains in which
   backtracking would involve attempting to undo actions performed in a
   dynamic environment, which may be difficult or impractical.
