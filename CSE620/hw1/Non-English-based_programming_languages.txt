Non-English-based programming languages

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   Non-English-based programming languages are computer programming
   languages that, unlike better-known programming languages, do not use
   keywords taken from, or inspired by, the English vocabulary.

Prevalence of English-based programming languages[edit]

   Further information: English in computing

   There has been an overwhelming trend in programming languages to use
   the English language to inspire the choice of keywords and code
   libraries. According to the HOPL online database of languages,^[1] out
   of the 8500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2400 of them were
   developed in the United States, 600 in the United Kingdom, 160 in
   Canada, and 75 in Australia.

   In other words, over a third of all programming languages were
   developed in a country with English as the primary language. This does
   not take into account the usage share of each language, situations
   where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but
   used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of
   Python from the Netherlands, or Ruby from Japan), and situations where
   it was based on another language which used English (see the case of
   Caml, developed in France but using English keywords).

International programming languages[edit]

   ALGOL 68's standard was published in numerous languages, and the
   standard allowed the internationalisation of the programming language
   itself.

   On December 20, 1968, the "Final Report" (MR 101) was adopted by the
   Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of
   UNESCO's IFIP for publication. Translations of the standard were made
   for Russian, German, French, Bulgarian, and then later Japanese. The
   standard was made available in Braille. ALGOL 68 went on to become the
   GOST/ГОСТ-27974-88 standard in the Soviet Union.
     * GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 - Язык программирования
       АЛГОЛ 68^[2]
     * GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended - Язык
       программирования АЛГОЛ 68 расширенный^[3]

   In English, Algol68's reverent case statement reads case ~ in ~ out ~
   esac. In Cyrillic, this reads выб ~ в ~ либо ~ быв.

Modifiable parser syntax[edit]

       names in different languages
     * ChinesePython – A complete translation of the Python scripting
       language into Chinese

       keywords into English in an educational version of the BlackBox
       Component Builder available as open source from
       http://www.inr.ac.ru/~info21/software.htm. The translation is
       controlled via a modifiable vocabulary and supported by modifiable
       compiler error messages. A complete Russian version is used in
       education, and it should be possible to accommodate other
       left-to-right languages (e.g. the Kabardian language has been tried
       as a proof of concept).
     * HyperTalk – A programming language, which allows translation via
       custom resources, used in Apple's HyperCard
     * IronPerunis - IronPython 2.7 localisation to Lithuanian and Russian
     * AppleScript – A language once allowed for different "dialects"
       including French and Japanese; however, these were removed in later
       versions
     * Maude - Completely user definable syntax and semantics, within the
       bounds of the ASCII character set^[27]
     * Perl – While Perl's keywords and function names are generally in
       English, it allows modification of its parser to modify the input
       language, such as in Damian Conway's Lingua::Romana::Perligata
       module, which allows programs to be written in Latin or his
       Lingua::tlhInganHol::yIghun Perl language in Klingon. They do not
       just change the keywords but also the grammar to match the
       language.
     * Perunis - Python 2.6 localization to Lithuanian and Russian
     * Protium – A language designed to support any possible human
       language
