   Relativistic programming (RP) is a style of concurrent programming
   where instead of trying to avoid conflicts between readers and writers
   (or writers and writers in some cases) the algorithm is designed to
   tolerate them and get a correct result regardless of the order of
   events. Also, relativistic programming algorithms are designed to work
   without the presences of a global order of events. That is, there may
   be some cases where one thread sees two events in a different order
   than another thread (hence the term relativistic because in Einstein's
   theory of special relativity the order of events is not always the same
   to different viewers).

   Relativistic programming provides advantages in performance compared to
   other concurrency paradigms because it does not require one thread to
   wait for another nearly as often. Because of this, forms of it
   (Read-Copy-Update for instance) are now used extensively in the Linux
   kernel (more than 5,000 times as of 2011^[update]).^[1]
