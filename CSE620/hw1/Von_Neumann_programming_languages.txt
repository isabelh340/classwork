   A von Neumann language is any of those programming languages that are
   high-level abstract isomorphic copies of von Neumann
   architectures^[citation needed]. As of 2009^[update], most current
   programming languages fit into this description^[citation needed],
   likely as a consequence of the extensive domination of the von Neumann
   computer architecture during the past 50 years.

   The differences between Fortran, C, and even Java, although
   considerable, are ultimately constrained by all three being based on
   the programming style of the von Neumann computer^[citation needed].
   If, for example, Java objects were all executed in parallel with
   asynchronous message passing and attribute-based declarative
   addressing, then Java would not be in the group.

   The isomorphism between von Neumann programming languages and
   architectures is in the following manner:
     * program variables ↔ computer storage cells
     * control statements ↔ computer test-and-jump instructions
     * assignment statements ↔ fetching, storing instructions
     * expressions ↔ memory reference and arithmetic instructions.

Criticism[edit]

   Using a metaphor from John Backus, assignment statements in von Neumann
   languages split programming into two worlds. The first world consists
   of expressions, an orderly mathematical space with potentially useful
   algebraic properties: most computation takes place here. The second
   world consists of statements, a disorderly mathematical space with few
   useful mathematical properties (structured programming can be seen as a
   limited heuristic that does apply in this space, though).

   Backus^[1] claimed that there exists now in computer science a vicious
   cycle where the long standing emphasis on von Neumann languages has
   continued the primacy of the von Neumann computer architecture, and
   dependency on it has made non-von Neumann languages uneconomical and
   thus limited their further development: the lack of widely available
   and effective non-von Neumann languages has deprived computer designers
   of the motivation and the intellectual foundation needed to develop new
   computer architectures.^[2]

   Some examples of non-von Neumann languages are: APL, FP, FL, J, Lucid,
   NGL, ZPL, Mercury, and Plankalkül.^[citation needed]

Presence In Modern Systems[edit]

   Many modern processors now contain multiple processing cores and have
   different buses for instructions and data (for example the Harvard
   architecture and MIMD). Furthermore, many modern CPUs support
   out-of-order execution and other advanced optimization heuristics. Thus
   these systems do not implement a von Neumann architecture at the
   hardware level. However, they retain some of its obvious features such
   as random access memory (RAM).

   Many widely used programming languages such as C, C++ and Java have
   ceased to be strictly von Neumann by adding support for parallel
   processing, in the form of threads. However, most of the categorically
   non-von Neumann languages are also functional languages and have not
   achieved widespread use.
