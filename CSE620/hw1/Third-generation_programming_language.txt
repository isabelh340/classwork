   A third-generation programming language (3GL) is a generational way to
   categorize high-level computer programming languages.^[1] Where
   assembly languages, categorized as second generation programming
   languages, are machine-dependent, 3GLs are much more machine
   independent and more programmer-friendly. This includes features like
   improved support for aggregate data types, and expressing concepts in a
   way that favors the programmer, not the computer. A third generation
   language improves over a second generation language by having the
   computer take care of non-essential details. 3GLs feature more
   abstraction that previous generations of languages, and thus can be
   considered higher level languages than their first and second
   generation counterparts.

   First introduced in the late 1950s, Fortran, ALGOL, and COBOL are early
   examples of this sort of language.

   Most popular general-purpose languages today, such as C, C++, C#, Java,
   BASIC and Pascal, are also third-generation languages, although C++,
   Java and C# follow a completely different path as they are
   object-oriented in nature. Third generation focused on structure and
   had no meaning for the object oriented concepts.

   Most 3GLs support structured programming.

   A programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal enables a
   programmer to write programs that are more or less independent from a
   particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level
   because they are closer to human languages and further from machine
   languages. In contrast, assembly languages are considered low-level
   because they are very close to machine languages.

   The main advantage of high-level languages over low-level languages is
   that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. Ultimately, programs
   written in a high-level language must be translated into machine
   language by a compiler or interpreter.

   The first high-level programming languages were designed in the 1950s.
   Examples of early high level languages are ALGOL, COBOL, and FORTRAN.
   These programs could run on different machines so they were
   machine-independent. As new, more abstract languages have been
   developed, however, the concept of high and low level languages have
   become rather relative. Many of the early "high level" languages are
   now considered relatively low level in comparison to languages such as
   Python, Ruby, and CommonLisp.
